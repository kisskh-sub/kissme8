[Reborn from the Ashes]

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.440
[Episode 26]

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.800
I've already told Wanyan Lie

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.920
that we will be away for a few days.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.750
I'll deliver the account book
to the Emperor.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.110
You must stay hidden until I return.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:25.710
Yeah.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:27.400
You have to come back safely.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.480
I will.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.230
Prince Han? Why are you here?

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.480
Qingran, why not

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.110
stay at my place for a few days?

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.800
Thank you for your kindness.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.440
I've been away too long.
It's time to return.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.040
You probably can't go back
to Prince Zhenbei's Mansion yet.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:05.880
Because of the account book.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.840
You...

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:09.440
How do you know?

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:11.750
The Emperor of this reign

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:13.880
is actually my own brother.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.070
The Emperor has long been suspicious
of Prince Zhenbei.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.110
Prince Zhenbei is opposing the court,

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:21.660
which means he is opposing me as well.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.520
If it weren't for that,

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.960
I wouldn't have made a second trip
to Yunzhou City.

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.270
You can rest assured.

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:28.480
I am here

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.070
to protect you.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.840
Please.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:56.440
Who is it?

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.320
Why do you confine me here?

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.270
You don't need to know.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.040
Just stay here.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.190
Maybe one day, if I'm in a good mood,

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.960
I'll let you out.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:13.520
Don't leave.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:14.750
Let me out.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:16.960
Who exactly are you?

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.590
It's been half a month,
and he still hasn't returned.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:21.920
He wouldn't...

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.360
Thank you.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.620
It's been so long already.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.590
There's still no news from Wanyan Jin.

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.270
Could it be that he...

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:40.590
Impossible.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.550
I'm just worried your trust
might be in vain.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.630
After all, Wanyan Lie

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.750
is Wanyan Jin's father.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.040
Would he really hand the account book
to the Emperor?

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:54.840
This account book

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.550
was obtained only after much effort
by Wanyan Jin and me.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:58.960
He would never betray me.

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.750
Don't be so sure.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.840
After all, a wife

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.920
and a father by blood,
which weighs more?

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.100
Think carefully about that.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.480
But he's not Wanyan Jin.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.230
What?

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.040
Then who is he?

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.230
You don't need to know all this.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.230
Go back early.

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.880
My Lord.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.800
The time has come.

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.110
Release him.

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:37.480
Yes.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:15.520
Jin.

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.590
How did you get hurt?

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.440
Sorry for making you worry.

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.800
What exactly happened?

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:27.440
The account book

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.190
was taken away.

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:41.960
You got injured.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.440
Go to my residence first.
I'll get the Physician to treat you.

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:47.360
Prince Han?

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.480
His place is very safe.
No need to worry.

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.000
Do you really trust Prince Han
that much?

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.670
He has helped me a lot these days.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.800
He was sent by the Emperor
to investigate Prince Zhenbei.

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.110
He also knows about the account book.

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.110
He should be trustworthy.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.320
About the account book,

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.960
it might be the work of Wanyan Lie.

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.170
I need to go back to the Mansion
and investigate.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.070
Then I'll go with you.

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:24.150
No.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.040
I'm still injured.

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:27.840
If danger comes our way,

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.110
I can't guarantee your safety.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.110
You are right.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:33.670
How about

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.320
Qingran stays here?

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.670
No matter what danger comes,

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.040
I want to be with you.

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.190
Who are you?

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:56.150
Why did you save me?

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:57.960
I'm here to help you.

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:00.400
Prince Han?

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:04.990
[Military Supplies Ledger]
Account book?

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:07.270
How did it end up in your hands?

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:09.630
Right now, you have it.

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:12.230
Let me tell you one more thing.

00:06:12.231 --> 00:06:18.525
(Watch on www.dramacool.club Support Admin)

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:13.480
Wanyan Jin

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.750
is not Wanyan Lie's son.

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:17.750
I've said what needed to be said.

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:19.580
I've also given what needed to be given.

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:22.710
How you use it is up to you.

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:25.150
Don't let me down.

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:29.840
Su Qingran,

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.630
Wanyan Jin,

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.230
I will make sure you both disappear
without a trace.

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.070
Didn't I tell you
not to come here again?

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:49.550
Why are you here again?

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.150
I've come back with news for you
this time.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:56.440
Wanyan Jin is not your biological son.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.320
You're talking nonsense.

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.670
If I want to return to the Mansion,

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.520
I must have an equal bargaining chip.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.840
How could this be false news?

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.230
If you don't believe me,
you can verify it yourself.

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:12.520
Is what she said true or not?

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.040
Is he really my son?

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:17.880
Your Highness,

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:19.460
the crown prince has returned.

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:20.630
Ask him to see me.

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:21.320
Yes.

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:31.270
Father.

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:32.590
Jin,

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.550
where have you been these past few days?

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.480
Why have you been away so long?

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:39.270
Qingran and I met Prince Han.

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:41.520
That's why we were delayed a bit.

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:45.920
It sounds ridiculous, I know.

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:47.840
Lately,

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:50.320
I've heard a rumor again.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.230
They say

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:52.880
you aren't my son.

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:54.840
I believe you,

00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:56.590
but gossip is hard to ignore.

00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:00.110
We'll have to verify it

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:02.400
to silence the gossiping crowd.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:04.480
Father,

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:08.270
someone must be trying
to drive a wedge between us.

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:11.270
We have already verified it last time.

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:13.040
You are truly my father.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:17.000
What's the harm
in verifying one more time?

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:23.560
This jade pendant

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.510
is called Ice Blossom Hibiscus Jade.

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:28.000
We drop our blood on it.

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:29.840
If our bloodlines are close,

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:32.230
the pendant will glow.
