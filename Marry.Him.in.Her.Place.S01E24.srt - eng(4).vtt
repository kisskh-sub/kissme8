Who goes there?

00:01:32.062 --> 00:01:36.182
I, Liang Yi of Chengyun Society﻿, have come
with my men to greet Staff Officer Wang.

00:01:36.752 --> 00:01:38.351
So it's you, Mrs. Lin.

00:01:38.352 --> 00:01:41.311
What brings the lady of Chengyun Society

00:01:41.312 --> 00:01:43.671
to a staff officer of Yunzhou?

00:01:43.672 --> 00:01:46.211
I have a business opportunity
I'd like to discuss with you.

00:01:46.212 --> 00:01:47.892
What business
could a military officer like me

00:01:48.072 --> 00:01:49.831
possibly negotiate with you?

00:01:49.832 --> 00:01:54.152
One that could set you up for life.

00:01:55.752 --> 00:01:56.872
Go on.

00:01:57.392 --> 00:01:59.192
I'll be straight with you.

00:01:59.212 --> 00:02:01.111
You came a long way in a hurry.

00:02:01.112 --> 00:02:02.361
That can't have been easy.

00:02:02.362 --> 00:02:06.261
Soon, you'll be back on the battlefield
risking your neck.

00:02:06.262 --> 00:02:07.636
You bleed for the cause.

00:02:07.637 --> 00:02:09.882
But, he, Song Ming,
reaps all the rewards.

00:02:10.225 --> 00:02:11.949
If fate turns on you,

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.874
there'll always be

00:02:13.875 --> 00:02:16.461
another Staff Officer Zhang
or Staff Officer Li to take your place.

00:02:16.462 --> 00:02:18.142
You're getting
the short end of the stick.

00:02:21.552 --> 00:02:23.232
So, what do you think

00:02:23.437 --> 00:02:24.557
I should do?

00:02:25.037 --> 00:02:28.736
Join hands with Chengyun Society.

00:02:28.737 --> 00:02:30.511
Once we succeed, Yunzhou will be yours.

00:02:30.512 --> 00:02:31.549
Jiangzhou will be mine.

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:32.999
We rule together

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.040
and keep it that way.

00:02:40.592 --> 00:02:42.671
You really are the daughter
of a merchant family.

00:02:42.672 --> 00:02:44.591
You have quite a talent
for sizing things up.

00:02:44.592 --> 00:02:47.391
I wonder
what your father-in-law would say

00:02:47.392 --> 00:02:49.224
if he heard this,

00:02:49.225 --> 00:02:50.712
Young Madam Song.

00:02:50.912 --> 00:02:52.552
How fascinating.

00:02:55.872 --> 00:02:57.631
Instead of keeping vigil

00:02:57.632 --> 00:02:59.272
at the Song Residence,

00:02:59.562 --> 00:03:01.792
you're here
plotting the future of the provinces.

00:03:02.072 --> 00:03:03.271
That was

00:03:03.272 --> 00:03:05.424
a clever plan,

00:03:05.425 --> 00:03:06.545
I'll give you that.

00:03:06.792 --> 00:03:08.791
If Governor Song hadn't
made arrangements in advance,

00:03:08.792 --> 00:03:11.912
you might really have
overturned Rong City today.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.536
Men, seize her.

00:03:13.537 --> 00:03:14.457
Yes, sir.

00:03:20.125 --> 00:03:25.945
(Rong City Municipal Hall,
Rong City Police Bureau)

00:03:42.862 --> 00:03:45.249
Staff Officer Wang,
thank you for coming all this way.

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.545
If this works out, I'll reward you well.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.420
Liang Yi,

00:03:52.672 --> 00:03:54.671
I've overlooked your mistakes
time and time again

00:03:54.672 --> 00:03:57.071
for your father's sake.

00:03:57.072 --> 00:03:59.945
Yet, you insist on defying me.

00:04:00.112 --> 00:04:01.111
To think

00:04:01.112 --> 00:04:03.872
you'd be as foolish
as that spineless father of yours.

00:04:04.072 --> 00:04:07.192
Don't blame me for removing an obstacle.

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.610
You killed my father.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:12.620
I did.

00:04:13.312 --> 00:04:14.620
So what?

00:04:15.752 --> 00:04:18.999
You really believe you can fight me
when you are already cornered?

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.911
My father did nothing to you.

00:04:20.912 --> 00:04:23.112
He overreached.

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.010
He insisted on investigating
the opium trade.

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:27.486
(Liang's Apothecary Ledger)

00:04:27.487 --> 00:04:31.127
Song Ming,
look at what your son's gotten into!

00:04:33.952 --> 00:04:36.912
I never imagined
that fool would dare touch opium.

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:39.649
Calm down.

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.699
I'll deal with him once this is over.

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:42.619
Once this is over?

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.071
Don't forget this.

00:04:44.072 --> 00:04:45.911
When Rong City banned opium,

00:04:45.912 --> 00:04:47.231
you led the charge.

00:04:47.232 --> 00:04:49.311
And now you want to cover for your son?

00:04:49.312 --> 00:04:52.271
Rest assured,
I won't protect him in this.

00:04:52.272 --> 00:04:54.911
But it is our children's wedding day.

00:04:54.912 --> 00:04:57.511
You can consider
this day never happened.

00:04:57.512 --> 00:05:00.071
The wedding is off!

00:05:00.072 --> 00:05:01.699
Liang, don't be rash.

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.071
Your daughter is so fond of Zhichu.

00:05:04.072 --> 00:05:05.351
I won't let my Yi

00:05:05.352 --> 00:05:09.320
marry a man with no integrity.

00:05:26.112 --> 00:05:28.086
You opposed me,

00:05:28.087 --> 00:05:29.752
so you must suffer the consequences.

00:05:31.592 --> 00:05:32.549
Adjutant!

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.471
(Righteous Spirit)

00:05:35.472 --> 00:05:37.431
Bring him back to the Liang Residence.

00:05:37.432 --> 00:05:40.112
Have Zhichu take care of him.

00:05:40.232 --> 00:05:43.671
Say the head of the Liang family
got drunk

00:05:43.672 --> 00:05:45.271
on his daughter's wedding night,

00:05:45.272 --> 00:05:46.991
fell into the well,

00:05:46.992 --> 00:05:49.272
and died by accident.

00:05:49.887 --> 00:05:52.471
My father trusted you!

00:05:52.472 --> 00:05:54.991
You and your son are monsters!

00:05:54.992 --> 00:05:58.391
Liang Yi, you're an impressive opponent.

00:05:58.392 --> 00:06:00.871
You married both my sons,

00:06:00.872 --> 00:06:02.991
set them against each other,

00:06:02.992 --> 00:06:04.951
and got Zhichu killed.

00:06:04.952 --> 00:06:07.872
But you won't live beyond today.

00:06:09.472 --> 00:06:10.592
Yun.

00:06:15.392 --> 00:06:17.392
Everything I have worked for
is about to fall into place.

00:06:17.575 --> 00:06:20.775
The only rift between us
is that wretched woman.

00:06:22.472 --> 00:06:23.512
Come here.

00:06:23.992 --> 00:06:25.832
I'll give you a chance.

00:06:30.112 --> 00:06:32.912
Kill her yourself,

00:06:35.432 --> 00:06:36.871
and all your past deeds

00:06:36.872 --> 00:06:39.112
will be forgiven.

00:06:40.575 --> 00:06:43.932
From this moment on, you'll be
the only son of the Song family,

00:06:44.032 --> 00:06:46.912
the only young marshal of Jiangzhou.

00:06:50.432 --> 00:06:51.912
Do it.

00:06:54.875 --> 00:06:56.761
Staff Officer Wang,
what is the meaning of this?

00:06:56.762 --> 00:06:58.499
I've decided to switch my allegiances.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.711
If Governor Song hadn't
made arrangements in advance,

00:07:00.712 --> 00:07:03.832
you might really have
overturned Rong City today.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:04.551
Men.

00:07:04.552 --> 00:07:05.432
Seize her.

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:08.680
Mrs. Lin!

00:07:10.812 --> 00:07:12.092
All of you, stop!

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:21.149
To think this pack of vermin
managed to slip into Jiangzhou.

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:21.949
Seize them!

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:22.950
Yes, sir.

00:07:22.992 --> 00:07:24.111
Wait.

00:07:24.112 --> 00:07:25.832
I have one request.

00:07:27.032 --> 00:07:29.432
You think you have
what it takes to revolt?

00:07:29.512 --> 00:07:30.791
Allow me to enlighten you.

00:07:30.792 --> 00:07:34.072
Commander Jin
has already surrounded your men.

00:07:37.192 --> 00:07:40.112
Miss Liang,
I'll send him on his way now.

00:07:41.312 --> 00:07:43.951
Yun, I'm your father!

00:07:43.952 --> 00:07:45.072
Father?

00:07:45.712 --> 00:07:47.361
You don't deserve that title.

00:07:47.362 --> 00:07:48.561
You think I don't know

00:07:48.562 --> 00:07:50.951
you ordered Song Zhichu's mother
to beat my mother and me to death

00:07:50.952 --> 00:07:54.472
because you hated
that my mother was a servant?

00:07:55.112 --> 00:07:58.471
She's dead.
She won't give you any more trouble.

00:07:58.472 --> 00:07:59.671
A servant

00:07:59.672 --> 00:08:02.271
dreaming she could use a child
to threaten me.

00:08:02.272 --> 00:08:03.752
Pathetic.

00:08:10.672 --> 00:08:12.551
I thought

00:08:12.552 --> 00:08:13.791
you went after Zhichu

00:08:13.792 --> 00:08:16.712
because his mother killed yours.

00:08:17.392 --> 00:08:20.232
Turns out I was the real target.

00:08:20.392 --> 00:08:21.512
That's right.

00:08:22.432 --> 00:08:26.419
I got close to him
so I could investigate you.

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:30.980
I want the Song family
gone from Rong City once and for all.

00:08:32.312 --> 00:08:33.432
Staff Officer Wang.

00:08:45.662 --> 00:08:47.742
He's not worth dirtying your hands.

00:09:11.792 --> 00:09:13.632
This is the only courtesy
you'll get from me.

00:09:14.225 --> 00:09:15.825
Do it yourself.

00:09:18.592 --> 00:09:20.392
Let's go home.

00:10:31.592 --> 00:10:32.712
Why are you hiding?

00:10:34.072 --> 00:10:35.552
You're bullying me again.

00:10:36.192 --> 00:10:37.074
Who's bullying you?

00:10:38.352 --> 00:10:39.432
You.

00:10:42.672 --> 00:10:43.952
Did I bully you?

00:10:45.792 --> 00:10:46.752
