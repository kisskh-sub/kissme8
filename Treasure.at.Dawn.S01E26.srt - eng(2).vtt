Master.

I didn't notice the hidden danger

in my sister's head last night.

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:06.870
I made her miss the best time to be treated.

Your rules are so boring.

What is a deathmatch?

A deathmatch is to fight to the death.

There are no rules and no time limit.

00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:04.280
Lord Wen, thank you for the tea.

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:06.520
I have something to do. Excuse me.

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:07.830
Chairman Sun.

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:09.830
Don't go yet.

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:11.830
Recently,

00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:15.760
many people have died.

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:18.110
Someone saw

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:20.110
your Chamber of Commerce killing people.

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:21.630
Is this true?

00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:23.960
It's true.

00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:26.000
I forgot it.

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:28.630
I caught the killer.

00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:31.350
And I executed him in front of the Young Mistress.

00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:33.480
I think

00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:34.960
that's the end of it.

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:38.150
I have a lot of things to do.

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:39.590
I have to go.

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:47.200
If nothing else,

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:49.000
I'll leave.

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:52.040
I won't drink tea.

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:03.280
Jue.

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:04.720
Why don't you

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:06.110
and Fu Sheng

00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:07.150
stay for dinner tonight?

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:13.980
Father, we have something to do.

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:15.200
We'll come back for dinner.

00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:17.240
Fu Sheng, let's go.

00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:53.350
Bravo.

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:54.790
Bravo.

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:15.720
Gu, it's rare for you to be happy.

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:17.150
I'll drink with you.

00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:21.870
I didn't expect

00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:23.440
that after I became disabled,

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:26.240
I would have to listen to others when I drank.

00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:28.480
I only had a little wine.

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:30.550
And you came to share my wine.

00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:34.120
Don't be a bummer.

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:35.300
One bowl is not enough.

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:36.830
Here. Have one more bowl.

00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:39.350
Cheers.

00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:41.680
Forget it.

00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:45.870
You said drinking was bad for your health.

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:48.480
Physician Fu, I don't want you,

00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:50.590
who cherishes his life,

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:53.550
to hurt your health for me, a disabled person.

00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:55.040
I can't afford it.

00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:58.240
Gu Tian, what are you talking about?

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:08.210
Fu Sheng, you're lucky.

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:09.920
Wherever you are,

00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:11.870
the city lord's daughter will speak for you.

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:15.860
I don't dare drink with you.

00:28:16.550 --> 00:28:17.630
Physician Fu,

00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:20.070
please leave.

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:25.760
Look.

00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:27.980
I am busy

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:29.760
seeing patients every day.

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:32.480
It's hard for me to take a day off.

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:36.440
No matter what you do today,

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:37.760
I will be with you.

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:45.390
If I'm going to a brothel,

00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:46.830
will you go with me?

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:51.550
I'll wait outside for you.

00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:58.590
I don't want people to eavesdrop on me.

00:28:59.470 --> 00:29:00.720
You'd better leave.

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:06.310
Still,

00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:08.960
I'm not going anywhere.

00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:12.310
Okay.

00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:14.720
If you don't go, I'll go.

00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:17.200
Will you stop it?

00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:19.830
Why would you do that to yourself?

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:21.310
Fu Sheng said

00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:22.790
there is hope to heal you.

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:24.920
Young Mistress.

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:28.590
You are the only daughter of the city lord,

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:31.520
the only Young Mistress of Xichuan.

00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:34.000
We're not

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:36.830
of the same class.

00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:41.090
How I treat myself

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:42.100
is none of your business.

00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:43.870
As for Fu Sheng,

00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:50.480
he never lied.

00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:04.000
I have to bear the pain myself.

00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:07.040
If you follow me again,

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:08.720
you'll harm me.

00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:49.790
Tuoba, get two men who are good at martial arts

00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:51.200
to take part in the competition.

00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:52.310
Remember.

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:55.680
You can't lose.

00:30:56.790 --> 00:30:57.550
And

00:30:58.160 --> 00:30:59.000
I want

00:30:59.270 --> 00:31:00.110
the jade

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:01.150
and the painting.

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:02.550
Got it?

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:04.630
Leader.

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:07.630
Why do you suddenly cling to the Treasure of the Sealed Book?

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:09.800
I heard

00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:12.040
that it could bring disaster on us.

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:15.000
What do you know?

00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:18.300
Those who get the Sealed Book get the world.

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:19.820
It's time for our Xiangshui Gang

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:21.550
to rise.

00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:23.040
Yes.

00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:24.150
I'll arrange it.

00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:25.200
Okay. Wait.

00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:28.480
Have the Chamber of Commerce

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:30.520
and Fu Sheng

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:31.960
made any moves these days?

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:34.520
Guo Sishui's border army moved this morning.

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:36.350
There's nothing else going on right now.

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:37.550
I'll keep an eye on them.

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:39.830
As for

00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:41.000
Fu Sheng,

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:45.440
only Gu Tian knows martial arts.

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:47.630
I heard he broke his arm.

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:48.760
He's disabled.

00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:52.150
He's really injured?

00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:58.310
All right.

00:31:58.550 --> 00:31:59.310
You can go.

00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:00.070
Yes.

00:32:06.550 --> 00:32:07.150
Come on.

00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:10.760
Go and see if Gu Tian is really injured.

00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:12.620
If it's true,

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:14.240
you can help him.

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:16.200
Kill him.

00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:17.520
Yes.

00:32:40.270 --> 00:32:41.200
Dao.

00:32:55.270 --> 00:32:56.090
Die!

00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:16.390
I didn't offend the Ma Gang.

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:18.110
Your friend Fu Sheng

00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:20.070
agreed to participate in the competition.

00:33:20.550 --> 00:33:21.280
And you

00:33:21.510 --> 00:33:23.350
are the only one who can fight for him.

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:24.630
That's why

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:27.480
I came at you.

00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:43.760
Go.

00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:44.280
Go.

00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:51.630
You drank a lot, huh?

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:53.040
I'll sober you up.

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:56.240
Stop.

00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:58.280
Stop.

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:02.390
Go.

00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:05.240
How are you?

00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:12.040
What are you doing here?

00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:15.520
We were looking for a place to eat.

00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:19.150
Do you think I would believe it?

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:25.840
I don't need you

00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:27.110
to have pity on me.

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:28.150
Gu Tian.

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:29.960
Don't do this.

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:32.400
Don't make us look down on you.

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:36.230
You've looked down on me for a long time.

00:34:36.590 --> 00:34:38.480
What are you talking about?

00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:42.270
I heard you talking

00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:43.800
about replacing me in the competition.

00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:48.590
Oh, my.

00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:54.520
Gu Tian, you are really petty.

00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:57.000
Since you've overheard us,

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.750
why haven't you overheard it all?

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:00.320
Yeah.

00:35:00.590 --> 00:35:02.000
We talked

00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:04.440
about giving up the competition.

00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:06.110
The most important thing is to heal you.

00:35:10.590 --> 00:35:11.190
Gu Tian.

00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:13.480
We never wanted to give up on you.

00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:18.440
Really?

00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:22.660
Since you only believe what you hear,

00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:25.260
I'll repeat it to you.

00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:27.450
You told me

00:35:27.590 --> 00:35:29.070
that you wanted a life

00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:30.590
with wine,

00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:31.440
meat,

00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:32.270
and the martial arts world.

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:35.070
I can assure you

00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:37.520
that as long as I have something to eat,

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:38.710
you will have something to eat.

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:41.860
If there's only a little to eat,

00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:42.550
I'll give it to you

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:43.360
even if I'm hungry.

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:46.110
In that case,

00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:47.190
as your friend,

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:48.480
I'll pay for all the wine and meat

00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:49.520
in your life.

00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:54.980
Are you fooling me?

00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:56.750
I can't give you

00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:58.480
the martial arts world

00:35:58.840 --> 00:35:59.800
you want.

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:02.310
But I promise

00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:03.470
I can give you

00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:05.390
the most important thing in the martial arts world:

00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:06.750
friends.

00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:25.880
All right.

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:31.360
I'll think of this arm as useless.

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:33.630
But I have another arm.

00:36:34.070 --> 00:36:34.920
And I have two legs.

00:36:35.070 --> 00:36:35.710
I can still fight.

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:38.520
I have a good foundation and learn things quickly.

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:41.220
As long as I'm used to fighting with one arm,

00:36:41.470 --> 00:36:42.630
I can still beat them.

00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:43.520
Yeah.

00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:45.400
That's what you have to say.

00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:47.880
You finally pulled yourself together.

00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:51.040
Now,

00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:52.920
