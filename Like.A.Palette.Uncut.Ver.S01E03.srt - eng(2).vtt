00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:59.880
There!

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.080
We got it, sweetie. Come back up here.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.640
- Quick, it's getting really hot.
- You good?

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.720
You're doing great!

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.760
Amazing job.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.800
- Have a seat.
- Thank you, ma'am.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.462
And who's next in line, Darin?

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.040
Pearmai here.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.520
Do your best, sweetie.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.240
Yes, ma'am.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.120
- You got this.
- Break a leg.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.480
Sis,

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.640
let's go take a look!

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:38.920
I'll go ahead, okay?

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:39.840
Oh, sure.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.560
Look at her striking a pose.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.080
She's pretty good at that.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.040
Certainly!

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.800
She's really good!

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.640
- I love that!
- Right?

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.680
- Which faculty is she from?
- Faculty of Law, ma'am.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.320
- Mm!
- Oh!

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.360
How many people do we have left?

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.120
Only one left this morning from
the Faculty of Fine and Applied Arts.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.560
Oh!

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:46.880
So where is she?

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Where's Jane?

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.720
What?

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:55.560
Uh...

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:56.680
Over there, I guess?

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.720
Maybe the restroom?

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.200
What?!

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.920
Where is she?

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:30.760
JaneWill!

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:31.560
I've gotta go, Mom.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.650
- JaneWill!
- They need me.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:35.840
What is it?

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.880
- Let's go.
- Come on.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.400
D*mn it, there goes my mood.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.280
I was gon' take some lil' photos
next to the shore.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:52.960
Huh?! What did you say?

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.240
I said I'm bummed.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.160
I was gonna take
some photos and relax.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:14.760
Gosh dang!

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.760
Ain't no one
but some annoying lads here.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.640
I reckon I ain't gotta go nowhere now.

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.800
Hm?

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.840
Are you still gonna go outside?

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.160
Naw,

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.360
I said I ain't gotta go nowhere now.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.760
Well,

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.080
if you don't wanna be nowhere,
you can go somewhere outside,

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.480
but you gotta ditch
those men coming after you.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.120
I ain't goin' out no more.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.640
You just do you, Jane.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.640
I'd better catch some z's.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.480
Cake, do you have time?

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.760
I do. Why?

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:05.920
Well, find something
to do with your time.

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.040
What? Jane,

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.720
you're low-key
getting on my d*mn nerves.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.280
Why don't you just ask Dai yourself?

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:20.920
Ask about what?

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.720
The thing you're curious about.

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:25.960
You asked me about it, didn't you?

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.000
Oh, it's nothing.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.640
I don't even remember
the question now.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:34.960
Alright then.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.080
I probably have to be more careful,

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.640
or else my beans
are going to spill all the way to Dai.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.360
You sure?

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:52.360
I'm pretty sure.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.712
I've been noticing it for a while.

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.480
Whenever she sees you,

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.520
she seems to avoid you.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.280
You're probably overthinking.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.000
A pretty lady like our friend Darin?

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:07.360
Who'd be disgusted?

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:08.920
Everyone wants to be around her.

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:09.760
Right, girl?

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:13.480
You're laying it on thick, Rong.

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.160
I never think of myself as pretty.

00:07:21.753 --> 00:07:23.520
Or is it that she's embarrassed

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.560
about that night?

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:29.920
Embarrassed?

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.640
You have beautiful eyes.

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.680
Jane!

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.880
I have no clue.

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:49.020
Neither do I.

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:52.640
I'd better take a nap.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:13.360
What?

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:14.881
Jane...

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.480
Why did you have to lie to me?

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.920
You also lied to me
about having to go home.

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.080
I just wanted to surprise you.

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:31.960
This is Porshe, and we're dating.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:34.840
Don't ask any questions.

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:37.640
Basically, just stop seeing me.

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:52.700
- I want some cake.
- Do you?

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:54.020
- Yeah.
- Should we order one?

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:03.000
Well,

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:05.080
I won't bother you anymore.

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:08.920
Happy birthday.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.240
What's up, girl?

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:11.560
It's Saturday,
and I have to come out here?

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:13.840
Tell me about it, Waii.

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:15.320
But JaneWill told me

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.240
to find something to do with my time,

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.560
so I was thinking about
being a total snooper with you.

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.720
I only have 20 minutes, though.

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.240
I have an appointment
with my hairstylist.

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.000
Okay, that's perfect.

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.560
Twenty minutes is more than enough.

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:27.320
What are we eating?

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:29.480
I want some cake.

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:30.960
Do you? How about a drink?

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:33.320
- What's good on their menu?
- Maybe green tea?

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.520
Pangpond!

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:36.440
Come here.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:39.560
- Hello.
- Hi.

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:42.040
What are you doing here?

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.320
What are you doing here?

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:46.680
I told you
to get some tutoring, didn't I?

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:49.720
This is my tutor.

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:51.600
This is your tutor?

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:57.640
Come here. Sit down.

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:00.040
Let's have a word.
Explain yourself now.

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.320
I told you to get a tutor, didn't I?

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:03.880
Why are you with a girl?

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:05.320
Um...

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.080
Can you pay for my drink?

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:08.280
Can I?

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:11.600
Absolutely not.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.920
Dad already gave you your allowance.

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:18.800
Gosh, Sis...

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:20.160
Don't "Sis" me.

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:22.560
Could I get one kiwi soda?

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.320
I'm asking her out.

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:30.040
You are?

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.280
- Mm.
- Your job is to study.

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:35.280
Huh?

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:40.120
We're in the talking stage.

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:48.640
This one is on me.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:53.631
Huh?

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.600
What do you mean "not yet"?

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:56.840
- Huh?
- We're still in the talking stage.

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:57.880
What talking stage?

00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:59.520
She's awful.

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.520
Look at her nasty manner!

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:03.560
Don't bring her
anywhere near me again!

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:04.960
Gosh, Sis.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000
I don't like her.

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:21.160
You certain this is the place?

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:24.280
You sure you looked at the right one?

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:26.280
Mm, it definitely is.

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:28.680
I looked up some reviews
of this restaurant,

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:31.040
and people say
their seafood dipping sauce is so fire

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:32.880
that you need to take it home!

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.560
Well, I'll be!
Sounds like it gon' be bussin'!

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:36.800
My belly done think
my throat's been cut.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:39.360
That's an expression
for being hungry, right?

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:40.240
That's right.

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:45.360
Please peel the shrimp for me.

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:48.000
Sure, I'll be
your shell remover today.

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:49.360
On one condition:

00:12:50.426 --> 00:12:52.260
- it's Darin's treat!
- It is!

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:54.040
- Your treat!
- Ugh!

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.280
Oh, Jane, Dear!

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:57.840
Come here!

00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:59.560
Come on!

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.040
Act fool!

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:06.240
What are you girls doing around here?

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:08.159
Looking for swai fish?

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:10.880
Swai are freshwater fish.

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:12.360
Since this is a beach,

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:14.320
I'm here for the sharks!

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:15.520
Ooh!

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:17.680
She's right about that, Yuphin.

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:19.760
- Mm.
- My bad.

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:21.240
Come on, take a seat.

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:22.360
Come join us.

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:23.280
Here, Jane, Dear.

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:24.560
Chop-chop!

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:25.680
Join us!

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:27.080
Come on, come on!

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:28.960
Please take a seat.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.280
Go right ahead.

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:31.720
Okay.

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:37.000
So how do you know we are here?

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:38.360
Uh...

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:40.600
I heard you said

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:42.280
if we didn't want
the food from the resort,

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:45.240
we could dine out and collect
the bill for reimbursement,

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:46.920
so I looked up some reviews.

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:48.360
Oh!

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.320
You can come to me for reimbursement.

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:51.880
But since we share the same table,

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:53.880
you can skip that,
and I'll cover the cost

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:56.040
without taking away the 200 baht.

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:57.000
Sounds good?

00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:58.661
- Ooh!
- Wow!

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:01.320
Here's our big spender!

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.680
- Totally!
- Can you treat us, too?

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:04.880
That means Darin got the whole table!

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:09.160
- Go on. Don't hold back on free food.
- Don't mind me, then.

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:15.720
- Is this cooked?
- Here.

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:16.653
Jane...

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:26.920
Hello, sir.

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:30.280
Uh, has anyone lost their phone strap?

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:32.360
I found it over there.

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:36.400
- Please hold on.
- Sure.

00:14:39.758 --> 00:14:41.000
Housekeeping,

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:45.578
has any guest reported a phone strap
with a blue dog charm missing?

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:48.520
A guest has found it,
so he turned it in.

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:50.920
No, ma'am.

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:53.400
Alright, if there is,
please contact me.

00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:55.280
Copy!

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:58.280
There's no report at the moment.

00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.480
My apologies.

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:00.640
It's all good.

00:15:02.076 --> 00:15:04.360
Then, can I leave it here

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.640
in case its owner
comes looking for it?

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:08.160
We can take a photo.

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:09.720
And you can leave your number,

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:12.120
so we can contact you
if the owner comes forward.

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:12.800
Alright.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.920
Typically, our resort has no policy
for holding onto guests' property

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:24.880
since we can't afford our staff
to break or lose it.

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:26.760
- My deepest apologies.
- Sure.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:27.800
Thank you.

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:29.560
Of course, it's my pleasure.

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:37.680
Am I doing it right?

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:38.680
Mm.

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:42.080
Let's start over.

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.560
It starts like this, right?

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:45.000
- You got that right.
- Okay.

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:52.960
Hello?

00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:57.080
I'm about to go home.

00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:59.320
I won't take more than 30 minutes.

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:05.600
What?

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:07.320
Why put your stuff away?

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:10.080
I was just saying that, NewYear.

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:11.273
I'm not in a hurry.

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:14.560
I can tell your sister hates me.

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:17.560
Cake?

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:19.920
That's just how she is.

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:22.560
She dislikes everyone at first,

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:24.160
but in reality,

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:25.820
she's a nice person

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:27.480
born with a foul mouth.

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:31.467
Ugh, we'll continue in school.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.440
Hello, Sis?

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:39.720
I'm going home now!

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:42.280
Man...

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.240
- Is this cooked?
- Here.

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:54.680
Jane,

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:56.520
- eat this giant shrimp.
- Eat up.

00:16:58.760 --> 00:16:59.760
Thank you.

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:01.120
Wait, wait, wait!

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:03.960
Do you know
what you have to do before you eat?

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:07.320
Oh, I know!

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:08.360
Wash my hands, right?

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:11.000
That's not it, Jane!

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:13.720
You gotta take some photos
for your Instagram Stories!

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:14.920
You too, Dear. Come on!

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:16.320
Take out your phone.

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:17.360
Quick.

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:19.720
Let them know how bougie our meal is!

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:20.680
Chop-chop!

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:21.520
Come on!

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:22.720
- Kaning!
- Hm?

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:23.960
Take some pics!

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.240
No, I don't do social stuff.

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:26.640
- What?
- Why?

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:29.080
Jane was right, though.

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:30.960
We gotta wash our hands before meals.

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:34.400
Taking her side, huh?

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:35.920
Do you normally wash them?

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.440
I always do!

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:38.480
Your hands?

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:39.240
Yeah.

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:42.120
Dude, what are you saying?!

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:45.760
Jane, eat up.

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:47.400
Dear! Dear...

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:49.400
Where's the plate?

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:50.280
Here you go.

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:53.600
Man, I haven't even had a bite!

00:17:54.267 --> 00:17:55.040
Peel the shrimp for me.

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:56.080
- Hold on. They're still hot!
- Gosh, you're holding it...

00:18:17.978 --> 00:18:20.369
I totally forgot
Dai is just right here.

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:24.720
I bet she's thinking I'm pathetic.

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:43.680
Uh...

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:02.120
Here you go, Jane.

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:35.120
Dai,

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:37.240
did you just peel the shrimp
for Jane alone

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:39.080
when there are others at this table?

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:40.880
What is that supposed to mean?

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:43.440
I can do it for you,

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:45.920
but I'll have to charge
a thousand per shrimp.

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:48.040
- Ooh!
- Anyone want my service?

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:50.040
Darin, are you in debt?

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:50.920
Yeah.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.280
You peel the shwimp for me...

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:06.840
What do you need?

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:09.440
"Shwimp"?

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:12.560
Shrimp...

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:14.320
That's what I meant!

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:17.200
Well, I saw that you tried,

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:19.240
and it jumped right out of the plate,

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:20.640
making a mess everywhere.

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:22.120
It's easier for me to do it.

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:23.280
Don't you like it?

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:27.880
I'm not buying it.

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:29.480
How's that even possible?

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:32.640
You're not even my peer mentor,

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:35.440
and we've only known
each other for just a bit.

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:49.360
How are you, Jane?

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:51.880
You told me
you'd call me back, didn't you?

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:54.800
Oops, I'm sorry, Mom.

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:57.480
I'm out for some seafood.

00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.320
I totally forgot, heh-heh.

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:01.080
Who are you with?

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:05.160
Dear and the seniors.

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:08.680
Call me when you get back
to your hotel room.

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:10.080
Okie.

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:16.720
Where is it?

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:18.360
Is everything okay?

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:22.880
I lost my phone strap.

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:24.120
- What?
- What?

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:28.160
Then, do you want
to check back at your room?

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:29.800
I'll look around the resort.

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:38.360
Quite a lot of mosquitoes here.

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:45.840
Uh...

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:47.800
I found it just over there.

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:49.600
Thank you!

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:08.600
Have you found it?

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:09.760
Yes.

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.520
Who found it?

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:14.040
A fourth-year senior.

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:16.280
Mm...

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:19.160
How did ya manage
to lose something that big?

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:24.280
Well, it probably got lost
while I was running from those guys.

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:29.066
It's late.

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:31.000
Go to bed.
You have an early day tomorrow, right?

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:32.720
Alright.

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:35.480
Let's go.

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:53.560
You released the shutter
almost 30 times,

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:55.080
yet you only got one pose from her?

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:57.080
Didn't she move?

00:22:58.480 --> 00:22:59.240
Duh.

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:00.540
I told her to,

00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:02.680
but I don't think
she knows how to pose.

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:07.720
I think she needs help;

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:10.240
otherwise, she's gonna fall behind
the other queens.

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:11.280
Look.

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:33.120
Hang in there, girl.

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:38.240
Just go!

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:49.720
There!

00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:51.120
We got it, sweetie.

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:52.480
Come back up here.

00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:57.960
Amazing job.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.520
- Thank you, ma'am.
- What gorgeous work.

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:03.680
And who's next in line, Darin?

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:04.880
Pearmai here.

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:09.440
Do your best, sweetie.

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:10.520
Thank you, ma'am.

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:14.480
Let's go take a look!

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:21.720
I'll go ahead, okay?

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:22.520
Oh, sure.

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:41.120
She's pretty good at that.

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:43.120
- I love that!
- Right?

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:45.240
- Which faculty is she from?
- Faculty of Law, ma'am.

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:57.120
How many people do we have left?

00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:59.960
Only one left this morning from
the Faculty of Fine and Applied Arts.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.240
- Mm!
- Oh!

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:02.640
So where is she?

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:06.160
Where's Jane?

00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:07.137
Well...

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:08.120
- What?
- What?

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:11.480
Over there, I guess?

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:13.520
Maybe the restroom?

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:14.760
What?!

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:17.840
She was just right here

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:18.760
a second ago!

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:36.360
Jane, what are you doing here?

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:38.200
I...

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:40.600
I was worried about the poses,

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:42.440
so I came out here to focus.

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:44.800
Why didn't you tell anyone
before coming out?

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:45.960
They're worried

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.760
and are looking everywhere for you now.

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:50.440
I'm sorry.

00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:58.960
Don't worry about being nervous.
I'll take care of that.

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:02.280
But I think you'll have to go back
and redo your makeup.

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:19.400
Goodness,

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:23.280
if there's anything, just talk to us!

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:26.800
Don't move your lips!

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:27.920
Ugh...

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:30.200
Come on.

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:32.320
We're humans.

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:34.520
Nobody was born all capable.

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:37.080
But if you're keen to learn,

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:38.640
you can be better!

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:39.800
Understood?

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:41.460
Girl!

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:43.000
I told you not to open your mouth!

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:44.200
I'm applying your lipstick.

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:46.000
Do you want to get it
all over your face?

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:47.240
Jeez, for crying out loud!

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:48.480
Good Lord.

00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:50.620
What's most important

00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:52.400
is courage!

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:54.680
You need that, do you hear me?

00:26:55.270 --> 00:26:56.910
Are you even listening to me?

00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:58.040
- Ugh!
- What!

00:26:58.080 --> 00:26:58.920
Erika!

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:00.560
Stop with the preaching, will you?

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:01.920
I'm applying her lipstick,

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:03.200
and you're gonna mess it up.

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:04.400
How much longer is it gonna take?

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:05.720
Jeez!

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:07.600
Just go now.

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:09.320
Anywhere but here.

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:10.920
I'm sorry, ma'am.

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:12.360
- Ugh!
- I got carried away.

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:16.680
Right, one more thing...

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:17.620
Erika!

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:19.280
Go!

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:21.200
Now!

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:22.720
Jeez!

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:23.920
Go!

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:28.280
Or else it's gonna take all day!

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:30.680
Understood?

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:35.840
Enough questions!

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:37.120
Zip!

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:39.160
No questions, alright?

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:19.200
Uh, Jane?

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:21.800
Can you give me one ultimate pose?

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:43.150
Halt!

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:48.400
Champ, that includes you.

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:50.560
Go take a breather.

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:52.280
And Prarong,

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:53.760
take over the camera.

00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:56.000
Uh, of course.

00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:57.240
I second that, Professor.

00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:05.600
Darin,

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:08.280
since you were the campus queen,

00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:10.240
you gotta help Jane out.

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:12.200
Use your experience

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:13.880
to mentor her.

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:15.000
Of course.

00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:16.640
I'll leave it to you, then.

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:18.000
Sure.

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:19.440
I'm gonna faint.

00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:20.680
I'm dead!

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:45.480
I never knew you liked snacks.

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:51.200
I don't like chewing gum,

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:53.920
so I hold this between my lips
when I feel like smoking.

00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:56.800
But I always end up eating it all.

00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:00.320
That's good.

00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:03.240
Now, the fumes won't cover up
how good you actually smell.

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:10.920
Hm...

00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:16.680
Don't you agree
we should talk about the pose first?

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:21.720
Sure.

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:29.160
Goodness,

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:30.960
Guichai,

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.240
my head is exploding!

00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:38.520
- Goodness, are you alright, Erika?
- Oh, my...

00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:40.600
I'm stressed out.

00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:43.040
How about this?

00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:44.480
I have an idea.

00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:47.720
Should we treat ourselves to somtam?

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:49.600
Oh, that'd be fab!

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:52.560
But...

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:53.400
But what?

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:56.440
We gotta add some fermented fish
from Plara PAKO!

00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:58.920
- Wonderful!
- Ate!

00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:02.200
Well, what about you guys?
Do you want some?

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:03.600
- Who here eats fermented fish?
- Me! Me!

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:04.520
- I do.
- Alright, alright.

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:05.400
Now we're talking!

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:08.040
Let's eat one after another!

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:10.920
Go ham on it.

00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:12.120
Good idea...

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:13.320
Ooh, the headache's gone!

00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:15.960
- Professor,
- Somtam...

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.080
the Queen of the Faculty
of Pharmacy is here!

00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:19.640
- Oh!
- Hello.

00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:21.200
I'm sorry that I just got here.

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:22.840
Yuphin,

00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:25.280
didn't you say the girl was sick?

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:27.520
- Here she is.
- Oh,

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:28.640
right.

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:29.440
What?

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:31.000
I guess it's a good thing, then.

00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:34.600
Wait, do you already
have your makeup done?

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:37.880
Then, let's start
with your still photos!

00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:39.520
Sure thing.

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:42.280
Then, I'll be her photographer.

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:43.680
Oh, no, thanks.

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:44.960
Champ, stay right where you are.

00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:46.080
I'll have...

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:47.680
- Prarong!
- Yes?

00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:49.120
Go take her photos.

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:50.160
Me again?

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:51.800
- Yes!
- What about my somtam?

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:52.920
We'll save some for you.

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:54.240
- Alright, then.
- Yeah.

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:55.640
Go. Stop obsessing over food.

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:56.680
You gotta work!

00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:58.480
Then, I'll help him out.

00:31:58.520 --> 00:31:59.840
That'd be amazing. Go on.

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:01.840
Then, I'll have Tim and...

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:03.680
- Kaning! Come give me a hand.
- Yeah.

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:04.920
- Get up!
- There!

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:07.000
What about Dai?

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:09.480
No time to look for anyone else.

00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:10.640
Go, do your work!

00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:11.440
Get me the reflector.

00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:12.440
- Get a move on!
- On it, sir.

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:14.360
- There!
- Please follow me right this way.

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.000
- Alright.
- We'll take the photos over here.

00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:17.360
- Come on!
- Go!

00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:20.160
Nice!

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:25.000
Yuphin!

00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:26.160
- Yes?
- Why are you still here?

00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:29.160
Go buy us some somtam!

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:31.120
Where's the cash?

00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:33.800
This nonsense again?

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:35.440
Just pay upfront like usual!

00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:38.160
Again?

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:39.200
Now, go.

00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:41.040
Move it! Quick!

00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:43.080
Ugh!

00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:46.640
- Acting like a cheap one!
- Right?

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:51.400
Do you happen to have 500 baht?

00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:52.320
Goodness!

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:57.430
- 500 baht.
- No.

00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:59.560
- Kaning, Tim, tilt the reflector a bit.
- Alright.

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:00.160
Right, okay.

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:02.000
- There you go.
- Ging, can you smile at the camera?

00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:03.320
Alright, smile!

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:04.600
Let's do one sweet smile.

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:06.200
Please smile at the camera.

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:08.360
I'm taking a break.

00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:11.200
Are you good?

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:13.200
It's way too sunny!

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:14.920
Why aren't we indoors?

00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:17.720
Right, I think this makes for
such a perfect scene

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:19.160
since the sea is just right there.

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:24.120
When is Dai gonna come?

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:25.480
Uh...

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:27.400
They're also busy with their thing.

00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:34.240
Professor Erika said
we should have a separate photo shoot

00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:37.360
since it can get messy
if the two sets are close to each other.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.400
Then, make it quick.

00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:42.800
It doesn't have to be all perfect.

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:44.560
We'll probably use
just a few of them anyway.

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:48.960
Right, okay, I'll be quick.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:49.770
Hey, guys!

00:33:49.810 --> 00:33:50.960
- Reflector up!
- Okay.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:51.720
Three, two...

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:52.560
Ging, smile!

00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:53.480
Three, two... There!

00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:54.840
Good, let's do this angle.

00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:56.200
Three, two, one!

00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:57.760
Three, two... Alright!

00:33:58.040 --> 00:33:58.960
There we go.

00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:03.960
She seems more professional.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:16.760
Good.

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:18.400
- There, give me more of that.
- Adorable, isn't it?

00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:20.040
- This is as far as I can go.
- Wanna move a bit?

00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:32.760
That's about right, Champ.

00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:34.680
I think we got it.

00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:36.680
Amazing job, Jane.

00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:42.740
You really did wonders there, Darin.

00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:44.080
Thank you.

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:45.880
We're back, Professor.

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:48.200
- All done now.
- We're done.

00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:49.960
Alright, come on in.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.600
Champ, you can continue
with the photos.

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:52.460
Alright?

00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:53.760
- The rest of you, sit down.
- Isn't it sunny?

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:54.560
Come sit!

00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:55.720
- Sure.
- It is!

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.520
- I miss you so much!
- Of course.

I heard through the grapevine

that you went hard on those poses.

It's definitely him.

If you follow him back,
