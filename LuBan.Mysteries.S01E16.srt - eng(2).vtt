I respectfully invite Lord Ma, the spirit guardian

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.880
Please bless my granddaughter

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:00.240
Keep her safe and healthy

00:01:07.519 --> 00:01:08.519
Save me

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.079
Grandma, Lord Ma's eyes can move

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:13.719
He can even talk

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.519
Lord Ma has shown his spirit

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.640
Lord Ma has shown his spirit

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.400
Help

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.760
Help

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:40.400
Help

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:45.760
All day long

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:46.920
what are you always fiddling with here

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.599
I am telling you

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.560
hurry and look for some carpentry work

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.000
Let go, Shuanzhu

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.920
Shuanzhu

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:53.280
Come here

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.799
Your dad has not been working for nothing these days

00:01:55.879 --> 00:01:56.519
Take a look

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:59.879
This is the renovation plan I drew for your house

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:02.120
Six big tiled rooms here

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:02.920
Shuanzhu

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.719
If the house your dad designed gets built

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.480
that eldest girl from Old Li's in East Village

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.639
will definitely be pleased

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:10.479
And Old Li

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:11.560
have you figured out

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.000
how much it will cost to build this house

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.800
About three hundred silver dollars

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.439
Three hundred silver dollars

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:20.080
We only have thirty silver dollars

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:21.240
We are way short

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.719
Do not worry

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.400
I have just found

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.479
a really fast way to make money

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:28.159
helping the police station solve cases

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.199
Now my income

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.800
is ten times that of carpentry work

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:33.000
Old Li

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.319
we are honest, decent people

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.400
no matter how much we earn

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:38.039
we cannot do things against heaven and conscience

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.240
What are you talking about

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:40.560
What I am doing now

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:43.360
is upholding justice, acting for heaven

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.439
At most I just help the police

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:46.759
crack a murder case or something

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:47.879
Murder cases are no good

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.560
That is too dangerous, we cannot go

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:50.800
What are you saying

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.719
I mean, Dad

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.599
how about we just do not

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:54.599
build this house

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.039
I am fine on my own

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.840
Shuanzhu

00:02:58.039 --> 00:03:00.159
Your dad is solving murder cases

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.560
I will not do anything illegal

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:03.120
Besides, what I promised you

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.479
I will definitely achieve

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.960
Do you think I talked too much

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:09.199
When Shuanzhu says that

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:10.680
it really makes me feel bad

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:12.639
Put the plans away carefully

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:14.680
I am going to the police station

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.159
Are you not having a bite to eat

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.560
Be careful on the way

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:41.879
The deceased is male, around forty

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.280
Arms and thighs

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.000
the torso has been cut apart and separated

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.479
showing varying degrees of decomposition

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:48.639
Unfortunately

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:50.199
the head is missing

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:52.039
so it is hard to determine his identity

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:53.240
and the time of death

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:55.280
The deceased's liver is missing

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:07.520
Just now by the west suburbs riverbank

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:09.159
they found more severed leg remains

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.759
So far four body-dumping sites have been found

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:13.800
All right

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.479
let's first sort out the locations

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.639
Today they are at

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:19.240
the East Alley kitchen

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:20.519
the west suburbs riverbank

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.439
a North Street trash bin, and

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:23.279
a vegetable plot on South Road

00:04:23.399 --> 00:04:24.759
Four sets of body parts were found

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.800
The problem is the distance between

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:27.800
each set of remains

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.839
is more than fifty kilometers

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.160
If the killer dumped them at the same time

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.439
how did he pull that off

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.360
He must have been driving

00:04:37.399 --> 00:04:38.160
Bro

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:39.800
there is a new case again

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.360
What are you doing here

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.360
You scared me

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.959
I am a model citizen

00:04:44.399 --> 00:04:47.000
I came to help you crack a case

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.120
You are short on cash again, huh

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.000
No matter how short on cash I am

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:54.759
it is not as urgent as our homicide, right

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.879
About that body dumping you mentioned

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.399
are the remains from the same person

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:59.439
We are not sure

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.079
we are still waiting for

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.560
Miss Su's autopsy report

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:05.600
If that is the case

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:06.720
then I can answer

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:07.800
the question you just asked

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:08.759
First

00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:11.160
it is the same killer

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.560
who drove around and in a short time

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:15.600
dumped the body parts

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.079
The second possibility

00:05:17.399 --> 00:05:19.560
is that different killers

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.079
dumped them separately at the same time

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:24.639
Does what I said make sense

00:05:28.519 --> 00:05:29.639
The autopsy results are out

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:32.800
Sorry about that

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:34.319
I forgot you are so squeamish

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:38.639
After stitching it together, we found

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.399
the body surface was uneven and bumpy

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.120
and the limbs were damaged to varying degrees

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:43.759
The good news is

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.360
we can confirm they are all from one person

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:48.360
Th then what about the bad news

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.759
The left arm came from a kitchen in East Alley

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.160
No idea how long it soaked in that pickle jar

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.759
The skin decayed and became deformed

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:57.040
The torso came from the riverside in the west suburbs

00:05:57.279 --> 00:05:58.680
It was also soaked until it was unrecognizable

00:05:58.959 --> 00:06:00.040
The other hand and leg

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.920
came from a trash pile and a vegetable garden

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:04.319
All the body parts show varying degrees of decay

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:05.879
So in short

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.199
there is no way to confirm time of death

00:06:09.959 --> 00:06:10.800
But fortunately

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.480
I found the cause of death

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.639
The victim's neck and heart were stabbed

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:17.920
causing fatal blood loss

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:20.279
From the wound shape and depth we can tell

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.360
the weapon was a carving knife

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.000
And during the dismemberment

00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:29.680
a thin, sharp saw like this was used

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:32.360
which left messy cuts where parts connect

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.399
They are not clean cuts

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:34.560
So

00:06:34.959 --> 00:06:37.079
the killer is definitely not a professional butcher

00:06:37.519 --> 00:06:38.560
More like

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:40.120
more like

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.600
a rushed decision to dismember the body

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:43.639
Right

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.079
I recognize this kind of carving knife

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:50.079
It is usually used as

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.600
a special knife for stone or wood carving

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:53.680
Also, this

00:06:53.839 --> 00:06:55.600
fine tooth hacksaw

00:06:55.959 --> 00:06:58.199
we carpenters use it all the time

00:06:58.439 --> 00:07:00.160
Some people use it to make

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.439
delicate wooden handicrafts

00:07:04.519 --> 00:07:05.439
Does he have any other

00:07:05.519 --> 00:07:07.319
distinctive features we can use to identify him

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:08.360
Oh right

00:07:08.839 --> 00:07:09.800
there is a tiger head tattoo

00:07:11.879 --> 00:07:12.600
Does that ring a bell

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.800
It looks like one I did

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.199
but somehow not exactly the same

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.519
I remember I once tattooed Hei Pi A Si

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.639
with a tattoo like this

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.120
Hei Pi A Si

00:07:25.839 --> 00:07:26.399
I know him

00:07:27.319 --> 00:07:28.519
That guy is addicted to gambling

00:07:28.639 --> 00:07:29.680
and always sneaking around stealing things

00:07:29.839 --> 00:07:31.000
He has made enemies with quite a few people

00:07:32.199 --> 00:07:32.879
Then for now we

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.600
can only start our investigation with him first

00:07:38.879 --> 00:07:40.920
The chief wants you two in his office

00:07:43.279 --> 00:07:44.720
How is the dismemberment case going

00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:45.680
Do you have any leads

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:47.680
We are still investigating

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.639
The papers are already reporting this case

00:07:49.759 --> 00:07:51.000
People are getting really scared

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:52.720
Yang Zong

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.319
You cannot handle this alone

00:07:54.519 --> 00:07:56.480
Why not let Zhao Wei work the case with you

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:57.839
Thank you chief

00:07:57.959 --> 00:07:58.759
I promise I will handle this case

00:07:58.839 --> 00:07:59.879
and wrap it up beautifully

00:08:00.279 --> 00:08:00.879
No way

00:08:01.959 --> 00:08:03.040
Wait what is that supposed to mean

00:08:03.519 --> 00:08:05.439
Are you the only one here who can solve cases

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:06.600
Are you the only super detective

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:07.959
Are the rest of us all useless drunks

00:08:08.079 --> 00:08:09.600
First time I have heard someone insult himself that badly

00:08:10.399 --> 00:08:11.040
Chief look

00:08:11.279 --> 00:08:12.240
We have a major breakthrough

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.120
We just confirmed the victim’s identity

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.399
It is Hei Pi A Si

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.079
Can you solve it within three days

00:08:18.639 --> 00:08:19.279
I can

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.240
If we do not solve it in three days

00:08:21.639 --> 00:08:22.560
I will not take a single cent of the bonus

00:08:22.959 --> 00:08:24.879
I will take a demotion and assist Captain Zhao

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.000
Count me in too

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.000
Then it is a deal

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:30.399
Got it chief

00:08:30.839 --> 00:08:31.800
We do not want the money

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:36.000
If we solve the case there is a bonus

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:37.080
Why would you not want it

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.039
I I uh well

00:08:39.279 --> 00:08:41.440
The plans for that new house

00:08:41.879 --> 00:08:43.559
are actually all drawn up

00:08:44.919 --> 00:08:45.759
Old Li

00:08:46.679 --> 00:08:47.480
What I meant was

00:08:47.559 --> 00:08:49.480
if we do not solve it in three days we do not want money

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:50.480
Right right right

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:52.600
The three of us the three swords as one

00:08:52.799 --> 00:08:53.679
will be unbeatable

00:08:54.679 --> 00:08:55.360
Yeah yeah yeah

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.200
Exactly Old Li

00:08:56.519 --> 00:08:58.440
Running cases now you are half a cop already

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.159
What you mean

00:09:00.399 --> 00:09:01.559
you do not believe we can solve this

00:09:01.799 --> 00:09:02.960
Of course I have faith

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:06.360
Then cut the chatter

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:07.080
Yes yes

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.440
So what should the three of us do next

00:09:10.519 --> 00:09:11.039
Lets go

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.159
We are going to bust Hei Pi A Si s lair

00:09:22.559 --> 00:09:23.679
Caught red handed with the stolen goods

00:09:27.559 --> 00:09:28.320
Officer Yang, Officer Yang

00:09:28.399 --> 00:09:29.279
What are you doing here

00:09:29.519 --> 00:09:30.440
Wang Mazi

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.360
You have really made something of yourself huh

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:33.799
I thought that after you got out of prison

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:34.759
you would turn over a new leaf

00:09:35.039 --> 00:09:36.320
but I did not expect you to be mixed up with Hei Pi A Si

00:09:36.399 --> 00:09:37.320
all over again

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:38.399
Officer Yang

00:09:38.799 --> 00:09:39.679
I I was wrong

00:09:40.039 --> 00:09:40.960
To pay for treatment

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.120
I borrowed some money from Hei Pi A Si

00:09:43.679 --> 00:09:44.600
I had no other choice

00:09:44.759 --> 00:09:45.919
I could only run with him

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:46.960
Talk

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.240
Who has Hei Pi A Si offended lately

00:09:50.799 --> 00:09:52.480
He has offended a lot of people

00:09:52.799 --> 00:09:54.399
He is always doing petty theft

00:09:54.679 --> 00:09:56.679
and cheating at the gambling house

00:09:57.279 --> 00:09:58.279
He is like a rat on the street

00:09:58.559 --> 00:09:59.879
even the dogs that pass by despise him

00:10:00.159 --> 00:10:01.000
I live in the same room as him

00:10:01.159 --> 00:10:02.879
I do not even dare to use the front door

00:10:04.639 --> 00:10:05.559
Take a look

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.360
The weapon that stabbed the chest

00:10:08.639 --> 00:10:09.919
was it a knife like this

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:13.240
It matches the wound on the body

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:15.600
Speak

00:10:16.039 --> 00:10:16.759
Where did this stuff come from

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.399
Officer Yang this was not stolen by me

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.240
It was Hei Pi A Si

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:20.919
He stole it from that

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.279
Master Wu of cork painting his house

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:23.320
It was not me

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:28.919
Right here

00:10:29.279 --> 00:10:30.519
Is it here

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.120
Why does it look like a funeral shop

00:10:32.159 --> 00:10:33.519
This is definitely the place

00:10:34.279 --> 00:10:36.840
Master Wu s cork paintings are famous far and wide

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.440
So a lot of thieves

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:39.679
come by here all the time

00:10:39.879 --> 00:10:41.519
He deliberately set it up like this

00:10:41.639 --> 00:10:43.519
just to scare off thieves

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:45.879
His cork paintings are really amazing

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.120
Back then I even wanted to study under him

00:10:49.919 --> 00:10:51.879
Anyone here anyone here

00:10:52.399 --> 00:10:52.960
Yes

00:10:54.679 --> 00:10:56.919
Hello we would like to see Master Wu

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.120
What do you want with him

00:10:58.720 --> 00:10:59.559
We are the police

00:10:59.879 --> 00:11:00.720
We are here to ask about a case

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.720
Teacher Wu is not seeing visitors please leave

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.480
Did you not say you knew him

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.279
Do not worry

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:09.320
Come with me

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:20.639
Here

00:11:20.759 --> 00:11:22.120
I do not think this place is that simple

00:11:22.279 --> 00:11:22.919
We must be careful

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:23.720
Kneel

00:11:26.559 --> 00:11:27.639
Do you know you were wrong

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:29.320
A Wen is sorry master

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:30.799
A Wen was wrong

00:11:31.799 --> 00:11:32.480
Is that Master Wu

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:33.480
What did you do wrong

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.519
As a craftsman A Wen

00:11:37.759 --> 00:11:39.240
did not protect his own hands

00:11:40.399 --> 00:11:41.399
As long as you understand

00:11:42.279 --> 00:11:44.600
Cork painting uses the knife instead of the brush

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.720
It is all hand carved with great care

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.600
to form complex images with fine textures

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.360
He is talking about that carving knife

00:11:52.519 --> 00:11:54.360
Your hands are very precious

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.279
You must protect them well

00:11:56.759 --> 00:11:59.639
You are the only heir to my Wu cork painting art

00:12:00.039 --> 00:12:00.960
You are exceptionally gifted

00:12:01.399 --> 00:12:02.960
As long as you work hard and focus

00:12:03.159 --> 00:12:05.799
your future achievements will surely surpass mine

00:12:06.399 --> 00:12:08.200
In the future you will carve

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.720
many astonishing masterpieces

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:12.519
A Wen will be careful from now on

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:14.360
and never make any mistakes

00:12:16.039 --> 00:12:16.799
Who is it

00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:19.240
I want to see

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:20.399
which little thief it is

00:12:20.559 --> 00:12:22.159
who keeps coming back again and again to steal
