00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:23.800
In the past,

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.870
when Hyung smiles,
I feel a sense of distance.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.990
There's a layer of fog
covering the smile.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:33.490
But...

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.200
it's different now.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:37.150
Hyung

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.550
is smiling
from the bottom of his heart now.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:40.490
It's warm

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.020
and sincere.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.960
At that moment,

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:46.800
my heart

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.460
would feel like it's free falling.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.130
Hyung,

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:52.970
do you know?

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.400
Your smile

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.850
shines brighter than anything.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.180
That smile

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.000
is really letting me

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.760
into your heart.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.800
When you were reading,

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.760
I liked to stand by and cook for you.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.560
That ordinary moment

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:34.830
is the realest happiness

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.910
in my world.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.310
Just like this steam,

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.580
my heart

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.100
is silently surrounding you.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.100
When I'm messing around

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.320
and you can't stop

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.200
laughing,

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.180
that's evidence of my love for you

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:58.789
and your love for me.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:23.960
What are you doing?

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.350
You've been having issues with me lately,
haven't you?

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.740
Then do it yourself, Chef.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.850
I don't want to eat by myself.

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:07.410
You should try it too.

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:37.750
How is it?

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.660
How does it taste this time?

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.800
It's sweet.

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:45.490
Everything you give is sweet.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.080
As if.

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.940
What are you doing? It's cold.

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:36.320
When I saw you wearing the Loopy apron,

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.760
I realized that
no matter how cold you are,

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.210
you will slowly melt for someone.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.750
And that person

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.200
is me.

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:01.560
What is this?

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:05.070
A critical notice from the hospital.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.100
Why can a piece of paper

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.010
cause so much pain?

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:15.800
Dr. David.

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:18.600
I need to book the room now.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.750
Just right now.

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:21.860
Yes, VIP-1.

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:24.500
I'll be the guarantor personally.

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:42.850
Why are you...

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.690
doing so much to help me?

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:56.400
Because I want to.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.290
What I want is

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:05.020
when you want to cry,

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:08.870
the first person you think of is me.

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:27.090
Hyung.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.720
I really want to tell you something.

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:34.550
Can I really rely on you?

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:37.270
I

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.960
am not that strong

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:43.430
and am not that good at things.

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:47.650
I know I always cause you to be upset.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:49.950
But...

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:51.900
Hyung,

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:55.580
you've always been by my side
looking after me.

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:58.230
I'm used to being alone,

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:01.820
but I now I want to rely on you.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:03.880
Hyung.

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:08.450
Is this really okay?

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:10.470
Can I

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.240
really completely rely on you?

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:55.040
Haejun.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.060
Look at me.

00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:58.920
It'll be okay.

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:00.900
I will protect everything—

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:02.970
everything you care about.

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:05.400
Your mum will recover.

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:05.520
Your mum will be fine.

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.180
It will all turn out to be fine.

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:09.820
This not consolation. It's a promise.

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:12.400
So stop crying alone.

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:15.980
Don't be sad anymore.
Your worries are now my worries too.

00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:18.920
Protecting your smile

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:21.880
is my reason to live.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:23.920
So,

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:25.600
please give yourself

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.560
and your future to me.

00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:58.360
I'll do anything for you.
