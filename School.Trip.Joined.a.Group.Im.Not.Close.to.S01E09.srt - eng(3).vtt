WEBVTT

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.496
(The day of the Culture Festival)
We're second-years now.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:13.520
It's been seven months.

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:19.040
- I can't see the mirror!
- You look so good.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.630
Come over here a little.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:22.730
Okay.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:24.790
Oh, Hioki.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:25.920
Come here.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.240
Let me fix your hair.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.210
Oh, thanks.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.020
Wait, did you change your hair wax?

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.550
Oh, yeah.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.240
I just tried a different kind today.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.590
This one...

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:42.630
Don't you like it?

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:43.890
No.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:45.410
I like it.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.180
I like it, too.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:54.950
Yeah.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.130
This is the first time in my life...

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.760
that I've ever had a crush on someone.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.170
Hey, let's all take a picture!

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.070
Hey, Hioki, you should dress up too.

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.150
- Huh? No, it's fine, I...
- Just wear it.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.650
Let's see.

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.010
How about this?

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:24.720
How do I look?

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.970
You're... too cute. I can't take it.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.306
You brought this on yourself,
but don't get all depressed about it.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.850
- Picture time!
- Yeah, let's take one!

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.279
Okay, picture time! Come on, over here.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.370
Right here, right here.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.950
Okay, ready? Say cheese!

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.000
"School Trip: Joined a Group I'm Not Close to"

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.610
(Episode 9: Culture Festival 2)
Wait, hold on, wait...

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:48.830
Hey.

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.700
Whoa, it's so crowded.

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.050
Are they all here for the "Four Kings"?

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.499
Our classmates started a rumor that you can
get your picture taken with Watarai's group.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.800
They're practically idols.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.790
Speaking of which, what's that?

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.830
A cat?

00:03:02.831 --> 00:03:04.810
Oh, it's supposed to be a wolf.

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.390
What's this?

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.100
What is this? What is this?

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.796
- Hey, stop touching it!
- It's so soft.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:14.820
It's not mine.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.120
Hey.

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:19.590
Um...

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.400
No touching, please.

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:26.550
Oh, Watarai.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.260
I've got reception duty next.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.780
Okay, got it.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:30.930
Good luck.

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.090
Yeah.

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:33.810
You know...

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.420
I've been wondering.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.920
What's the deal with you two?

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.640
Huh?

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.419
Because whenever we're talking,

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:42.780
he always butts in.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.060
Don't tell me...

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.780
Are you jealous...

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:51.416
that we're friends with Hioki?

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.960
You idiot. What are you talking about?

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.820
I knew it. So that's what it is.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.149
Whatever, man.
We've been friends since middle school.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.340
- And we're his best friends.
- Best friends?

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:03.590
You wouldn't know, would you?

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.550
- Like stuff from his middle school days.
- Huh?

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.760
Like what?

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:10.670
Like...

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:12.600
Umm...

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:17.600
At his middle school

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.310
graduation ceremony,

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.640
Hioki was so nervous

00:04:20.641 --> 00:04:23.441
that when they announced "underclassmen,
please rise," he stood up too.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.180
Wasn't that you?

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.190
And also...

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:29.489
during the club training camp,

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.610
the time he wore his shirt
inside out the whole time?

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.080
- Yeah, that was you too, wasn't it?
- In middle school...

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.960
during break time,

00:04:34.961 --> 00:04:38.060
how I sometimes used to steal the
jelly dessert from Hioki's lunch box?

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.130
That was also you...
Wait, you actually did that?

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:41.629
- Huh?
- Oh, crap.

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.580
- I had no idea.
- What's wrong with you?

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:44.820
Huh?

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.940
By the way, your name is Tsujitani, right?

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.660
Are you on Instagram or something?

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:52.240
Yeah, I am...

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:53.360
Let's follow each other.

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.780
I want to hear more stories about Hioki.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.970
I guess I have no choice.

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.719
Um, if you don't mind,

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.840
could we exchange contacts, too?

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.030
For pictures of Hioki's club activities
and stuff...

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:10.520
Sure, of course.

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.060
For real?

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Thank you so much!

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.190
Watarai.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.740
He's a nice guy.

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.810
To be honest, I was worried at first.

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.050
I thought they were just
using you as an errand boy.

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.790
Yeah, I was nervous at first, too.

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.060
Actually, I still don't get it.

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.890
A guy with legs that long,
who's totally in another league...

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.070
Why is he so attached to you?

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.070
That's what I'd like to know.

00:05:39.003 --> 00:05:40.443
- So you don't get it either?
- Nope.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.590
Excuse me.

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.656
- Could you please write your name and...
- Hey, Asahi?

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.680
Anna?

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.120
Oh, Tsujitani, you're here too.

00:05:50.876 --> 00:05:52.110
Hey, it's Ikegaya.

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:53.650
Long time no see.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.850
By the way, what is
that? It's so cute. A cat?

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.020
Nope, it's a wolf.

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:59.529
Oh, that's right.

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:01.300
I heard you're doing a Halloween café.

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:02.779
Huh? Who told you?

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.670
Watarai-kun DMed me...

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:06.660
Watarai.

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:08.660
Crap.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.000
No, wait, it's not like that.

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.120
- Sorry, forget I said anything.
- He DMed you...?

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.060
Huh?

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:17.230
Oh.

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:18.690
What was that all about?

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:22.150
Why would Watarai be
messaging Anna, anyway?

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.300
(End of the line)

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:27.450
Then again, Watarai has a lot of fans...

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:30.070
so it's not weird that Anna follows him.

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.056
Hioki-kun, could I talk to you for a sec?

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:36.280
Quickly.

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:39.760
Crouch down. Get lower.

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:42.800
Who's that girl?

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:44.570
Is she Watarai-kun's girlfriend?

00:06:47.853 --> 00:06:49.563
And isn't she super cute?

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:51.100
She really is.

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:52.420
It's kind of annoying, but...

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:53.910
they actually look good together.

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:55.340
Hey.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.500
Oh, Hioki.

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:19.830
You're back.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:21.260
Welcome back.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:22.680
Oh, yeah.

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:24.320
I'm back.

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:30.770
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:34.510
Here you go.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.280
- Make a heart sign. - A heart?
- Okay, I'm taking it now.

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:42.300
You're right.

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:44.360
Those two really do look good together.

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:47.010
One more, please.

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:52.690
Oh, it looks like we're
almost out of cookies.

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:54.810
Can someone go get more
from the home-ec room?

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:56.260
- I'll go.
- Okay.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:57.260
Thanks.

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:04.190
Watarai-kun, you've got the next table.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.810
And then the table after that.

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:08.800
Oh, okay.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.840
Why does my chest feel so tight?

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:18.680
Um...

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:20.060
Need a hand?

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:21.780
Huh?

00:08:22.191 --> 00:08:23.720
Long time no see, Asahi.

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:24.760
Ryoto!

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:26.200
- You made it.
- Yeah.

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:28.770
Wait, are non-students
even allowed in here?

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:30.730
It's fine, don't worry about it.

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:32.500
Oh, sorry.

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:36.500
You seemed a little spaced out just now.

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:37.570
Is something on your mind?

00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:39.180
Huh? Oh...

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:40.500
It's nothing.

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:43.320
Could it be about...

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:45.030
Tsukasa?

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.160
Huh?

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:48.730
You like him, don't you?

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:49.879
You're in love with Tsukasa.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:50.880
What... Huh?!

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:52.230
Why would you...

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:53.780
say that all of a sudden?

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:55.530
You're so flustered.

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:57.450
You're such an open book.

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:00.210
Oh, it's okay.

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:02.160
I'm not teasing you or anything.

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:04.210
Actually, I...

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:06.090
I've dated a guy before, too.

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:08.770
You have?

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:10.100
Yeah.

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:12.349
That's why back at the beach,

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:14.160
I was secretly rooting for you two.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Still...

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:17.100
I'm really happy for you.

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:18.820
If you both feel the same way.

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:24.050
Is that really a good thing?

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:26.100
Huh?

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:28.550
Oh, no.

00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:31.840
It's just... for Watarai...

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:34.810
Is it really okay for him to be with me?

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:38.380
Oh.

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:40.310
So that's what was going on.

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:44.440
But...

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:46.230
Tsukasa is really popular...

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:49.020
I can see why you'd
feel insecure about that.

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:50.730
It's just...

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:52.910
You really don't have to
worry about that, you know?

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:54.960
Because...

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:57.780
That guy is crazy about you.

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:00.850
Is that so?

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:04.100
No matter how you look at it,
he's the super clingy type, right?

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:07.380
W-Well...

00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:08.530
I mean...

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:11.810
But actually...

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.710
I'm kind of jealous of Tsukasa.

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:15.460
Huh?

00:10:15.461 --> 00:10:16.760
(Home Economics Classroom)

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.380
To be that devoted,

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:26.810
to go for it without a second thought.

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:32.530
To be able to fall for someone that hard...

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:35.410
Once you're older...

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:36.730
it's a lot harder to do.

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:45.580
If you're feeling anxious...

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:47.850
you should just talk it all out with him.

00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:52.240
I'm sure if it's him...

00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:54.730
he'll accept all of it.

00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:00.130
That's what...

00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:01.350
I think, anyway.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Okay.

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:10.749
By the way, what is that?

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:11.610
Those ears...

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:12.610
Are you a cat?

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.630
Oh, these are wolf ears...

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:25.000
(SOLD OUT)

00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:27.370
Ah...

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:29.830
It's finally over.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:31.750
That was total hell.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:34.680
Ugh, I'm too tired to
check out the other classes.

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:36.180
Me too.

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:38.260
I want to take a break.

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:41.320
Oh, speaking of which, I'm starving.

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:43.580
I'm craving meat.

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:45.630
Hioki.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.440
Yeah?

00:11:48.493 --> 00:11:50.203
If you're not tired...

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:52.250
do you want to walk around together?

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:56.740
Huh? Sure.

00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:03.410
Ah.

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:04.910
But before that...

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:06.770
there's something I want to ask you.

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:08.710
Hm?

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:12.780
Hioki!

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:13.880
Ah!

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:15.440
Whoa!

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:18.210
What do I do, what do I do, what do I do?

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:19.210
Help me!

00:12:19.643 --> 00:12:20.643
Please join the...

00:12:21.199 --> 00:12:23.290
(Inter-Club Costume Contest)
I need you, Hioki...

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:24.850
to dress up as a girl.

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:27.540
Please!

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:29.190
I'll spend my whole life... no,

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:31.280
I'll beg you in my next life too!

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:34.176
That's the first time I've ever seen
someone bet their next life on something.

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:35.400
What's this all of a sudden?

00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:37.110
Well, you see...

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:43.710
Our badminton club was going to
have a first-year, Yamada, as our rep...

00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:48.000
but he ate a frankfurter
that fell on the ground.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.190
And now he has a stomachache.

00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:51.250
Huh?

00:12:51.251 --> 00:12:52.470
That's the reason?

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.380
Wait, can't you ask someone else?

00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:57.139
Uh... Well, because of the costume size,

00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:58.960
it has to be someone with a smaller build.

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:02.130
Besides, I already asked
everyone else, and they all said no.

00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:04.150
So...

00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:05.770
Please.

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:09.960
You're the only one who can do it now.

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:13.000
But...

00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:16.090
Why not?

00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:18.250
If Hioki is up for it.

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:20.820
Oh, and...

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:23.980
there's something in it for you too, Hioki.

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:26.120
Look at this.

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:27.686
(Participation Prize) There's a
yakiniku place in front of the station...

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:29.290
that's all-you-can-eat.

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:32.060
- Yakiniku?
- For real?

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:33.150
All-you-can-eat...!

00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:34.780
See?

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:35.780
So please do it.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:42.360
Shot right to the heart!~

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:50.390
Okay, everyone! Representing
the badminton club...

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.660
let's welcome Asahi-chan!

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:14.160
What the heck is this...

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:15.380
This is so embarrassing.

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:18.860
(Super Cute Asahi)
Asahi-chan!

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:20.670
Look over here, look over here!

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:21.830
I can't take this anymore.

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:23.920
So cute!

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:26.140
You're adorable!

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:29.660
Those guys have no idea how I feel.

00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:31.999
Of all times...

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.280
to be this embarrassed in front of Watarai.

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:43.440
What's with him?

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:44.890
Is he mad?

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:48.920
No, that can't be it.

00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:51.130
He must be...

00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:52.640
so disappointed in me.

00:14:57.660 --> 00:14:59.300
If I were a girl...

00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:01.520
would I not have to worry about all this?

00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:19.010
In the end...

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:20.990
we didn't get to talk at all today.

00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:27.850
Thank goodness.

00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:30.140
So this is where you were.

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:31.770
Watarai, what are you doing here?

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:33.770
Today...

00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:35.480
you seemed...

00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:37.610
kind of down...

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:41.410
so I really wanted to talk
to you, no matter what.

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:48.880
Hioki.

00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:50.710
What's wrong?

00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:56.050
Oh no, I...

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:01.050
I think I... really, really like you.

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:06.560
Come to think of it...

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:08.600
I don't really know
what's going on anymore.

00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:11.450
You're always too much for me to handle.

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:13.280
Huh?

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:15.360
Uh, well...

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:16.940
For me...

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:19.540
falling in love with someone...

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:21.156
or having someone fall in love with me...

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:22.980
this is the first time
in my life for either.

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:25.910
So...

00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:27.190
I just feel like...

00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:30.210
everything is an emotion
I'm feeling for the first time.

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:32.949
Someone like me...

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:34.130
is it really okay?

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:36.460
Wouldn't you be a better match with Anna?

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.040
And if...

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:42.150
I...

00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:45.100
were a girl, what would that be like?

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:49.070
As I think about it, I start to feel...

00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:50.790
all gloomy inside...

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:52.810
and I don't even understand myself anymore.

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:55.070
- Um...
- Hioki.

00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:56.810
Don't tell me you spent...

00:16:57.620 --> 00:16:59.446
the entire day worrying
about this all by yourself?

00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:00.570
Ah, no, well...

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:02.890
Anna... ah...

00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:05.820
I'm okay with you and Ikegaya-san.

00:17:08.498 --> 00:17:10.479
I don't mean you can't be friends.

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:11.990
That's not what I meant...

00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:17.220
I'm sorry.

00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:19.310
I made you feel insecure.

00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:27.640
With Ikegaya-san...

00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:29.560
I was the one asking her for advice.

00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:32.710
Advice?

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:33.980
Yeah.

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:36.130
Um...

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:39.700
Since Christmas...

00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:40.940
is coming up,

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:44.720
I wanted to get you a present.

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:47.360
Huh?

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:49.030
So...

00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:51.450
I wanted to find out what you like.

00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:55.570
When I was talking to
her in the classroom...

00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:00.290
it was because she told me,
"Hioki might have found out."

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:02.020
She was apologizing to me.

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:08.020
So that's what it was.

00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:11.480
- I'm sorry, I...
- No...

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:16.090
I should have found the time sooner...

00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:18.830
to explain things to you properly.

00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:21.550
I'm sorry.

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:23.830
For making you feel so anxious.

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:26.220
No...

00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:28.430
And also...

00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:30.490
about what you said earlier...

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:33.640
about "if you were a girl."

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:39.070
Today, I was actually...
thinking about the same thing.

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:42.100
Huh?

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:44.440
Or rather...

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:46.980
it made me realize it all over again.

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:49.980
Realize what?

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:52.220
Yeah.

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:55.710
If...

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:57.240
you were a girl...

00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:01.070
we probably wouldn't have
the relationship we have now.

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:03.210
Huh?

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:05.140
No, I mean...

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:06.880
If you were a girl...

00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:10.950
we probably couldn't have been in
the same group for the school trip.

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:13.380
Oh...

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:15.480
So that's what you meant.

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:18.890
In that case...

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:20.820
we wouldn't have been able to...

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:24.190
spend all that time together,
from morning to night.

00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:25.470
And we wouldn't have...

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:28.660
had the chance for our
relationship to turn into this.

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:31.560
That's true.

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:34.000
So even still...

00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:37.380
It doesn't matter if
you're a guy or a girl.

00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:40.590
I just like you for who you are.

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:55.260
Me too...

00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:02.770
Me too...

00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:04.510
Because it's you...

00:20:06.669 --> 00:20:08.440
That's why I fell for you.

00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:15.530
Yeah.

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:24.760
Well then...

00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:25.990
Shall we go?

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:27.460
Yeah.

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:36.190
What's wrong?

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:38.010
- Do your feet hurt?
- Yeah, a little.

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:39.286
I think I'm getting a blister.

00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:40.870
Let me carry you.

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:42.210
No, no, no, you don't have to.

00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:43.750
Besides, I'm heavy.

00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:46.660
I've been weight training ever since then.

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:49.210
I bet I have more muscle than you do.

00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:52.240
No way. I'm on a sports team, you know.

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:56.120
Do you work out?
Weight training?

00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:57.760
Yeah, I do.

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:00.420
Like this.

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:04.710
See? A little definition, right?

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:06.890
Not at all.

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:08.250
By the way...

00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:11.140
This sort of thing...

00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:12.530
I think I get it now.

00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:14.350
Huh? Get what?

00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:33.170
Oh.

00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:58.480
For doing that to me...
you know what's coming, right?

00:22:10.073 --> 00:22:11.073
Kidding, kidding.

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:12.600
Did you not like it?

00:22:15.050 --> 00:22:16.490
It's not that I didn't like it...

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:19.320
It's just...

00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:22.750
Go easy on me.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.110
Please.

00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:27.180
Okay.

00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:31.900
Come on, everyone's waiting. Let's go.

00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:33.690
Yeah.

00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:36.430
Okay.

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:39.890
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:51.380
- Ow! - Oh, sorry.
- I've got a blister.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.650
Sorry, let's just walk.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.680
(A pure high school love story
reaches its finale.) Merry Christmas!

00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:00.450
Watarai is always so
good at saying how he feels.

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:03.366
(The answer they found for themselves was—)
He tells me how he truly feels.

00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:05.050
I think that's truly amazing.

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:07.750
Watarai, I love you.
