You made them.

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:23.530
You aren't so bad either.

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:25.500
Of course not.

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:27.460
You picked me.

00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:58.260
So mushy.

00:16:58.800 --> 00:16:59.810
He said he'd bring her something.

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:02.100
Look at those empty hands.

00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:03.500
He already did.

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:13.140
Goodbye.

00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:20.140
This is for you.

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:27.780
Is this the gift you prepared

00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:29.140
for my departure?

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:31.970
I don't know what you like.

00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:35.490
Anyway, the world is wide.

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:37.210
In the days to come,

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:38.580
take care of yourself.

00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:40.860
Don't let hatred bind you anymore.

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:44.380
I will remember it.

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:49.620
All these years in Chang'an,

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:51.340
meeting you

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:56.170
has been my greatest fortune.

00:17:58.100 --> 00:17:58.950
Mine as well.

00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:25.100
I came to see off my friend.

00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:26.380
It's fine that you came along,

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:28.140
but why is he here too?

00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:33.060
Yes.

00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:34.820
If no one watches him

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:36.410
and he runs off,

00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:37.540
he'll be a corpse

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:39.650
when we find him again.

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:43.650
You really can't say a single kind word.

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:46.890
I thought you were going to propose,

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:48.450
so I came to back you up.

00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:49.540
Who knew

00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:51.170
you'd just send her away?

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:52.890
Why do you all think

00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:54.020
I came to propose?

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:56.450
Do I look like someone who is sentimental?

00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:59.060
I'm a swordsman.

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:00.170
A swordsman!

00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:01.660
My life hangs by a thread every day.

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:03.330
Someone like me

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:05.220
can love many women.

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:14.980
Fine, I admit it.

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:16.570
I do like her.

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:18.300
But she came to Chang'an alone

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:20.330
for revenge and nothing else.

00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:23.680
How much room would there be

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:24.610
in her heart for me?

00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:26.850
Besides,

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:29.240
I don't want her following me

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:30.610
into danger after danger.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:32.890
It's better

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:35.370
to let go.

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.330
The world is wide.

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:40.850
If fate allows, we'll meet again.

00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:47.610
Come on.

00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:02.410
Besides Xiaoqing,

00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:04.020
do you have

00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:05.780
any other friends in Chang'an?

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:07.780
When I was a student,

00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:09.450
I had a few classmates I could talk to.

00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:12.210
But most of them

00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:14.620
took up official positions,

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:17.780
and we gradually lost touch.

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:20.210
Xiaoqing is your messenger,

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:21.890
but we get along well.

00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:23.890
Having one or two people

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:25.580
you truly connect with

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:27.450
is enough.

00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:29.860
Aside from painting,

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:31.250
what else

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:34.690
do you do?

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:40.690
I like the hustle and bustle of the marketplace.

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:42.820
Watching people buy vegetables,

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:44.140
buy meat,

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:45.860
and choose clothes

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:47.580
is interesting enough

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:49.690
to me.

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:53.620
Sometimes, I run into an old man

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:55.860
playing the flute on the street.

00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:58.540
When I do, I sit beside him

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:00.930
and listen from dusk

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:03.300
until night falls.

00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:06.450
Before Mr. Yang's death,

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:09.020
the Chang'an I saw

00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:11.890
was ordinary

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:14.860
and real.

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:18.650
I came to Chang'an by chance.

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:22.020
After what happened in the reed marsh,

00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:24.140
my parents sought help everywhere

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:25.920
and finally sent me here to study.

00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:27.340
It was, in truth,

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:29.250
to shield me from danger.

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:31.340
As I grew older,

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:33.450
they finally felt safe

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:35.380
letting me live here on my own.

00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:39.580
Your family

00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:42.930
must miss you very much.

00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:44.380
Yes.

00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:47.620
We haven't met for a year or two.

00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:49.650
I miss them.

00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:52.620
I should go home and see them.

00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:54.650
Having family

00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:56.730
and people you care about

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:00.060
is a fortunate thing.

00:22:01.455 --> 00:22:08.455
(Watch on www.dramacool.club Support Admin)

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:05.140
If you hadn't kept in touch with me,

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:07.490
those trying to kill me

00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:11.300
would never have found you.

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:13.240
Seven years ago,

00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:15.150
in the reed marsh,

00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:17.490
your parents

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:21.160
nearly lost their daughter.

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:30.340
I understand

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:32.300
what you're saying.

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:34.690
But I'm

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:35.860
a simple person.

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:37.820
If I want to leave,

00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:40.690
it's because I want to leave.

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:44.170
It has nothing to do

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:45.820
with whether Chang'an is safe.

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:47.380
And if I want to stay,

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:49.730
no one

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:51.890
can drive me away.

00:22:57.390 --> 00:22:58.060
Wan,

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:01.140
you're as stubborn

00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:03.780
as when you were a child.

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:08.620
But this time,

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:12.690
I truly must go.

00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:17.300
With my teacher gone,

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.780
my parents and sister are surely worried about me.

00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:21.210
I have to go home

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:23.890
so they know I'm safe.

00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:38.450
From when we met seven years ago

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:40.860
until our reunion now,

00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:43.780
your life has been filled with blood and danger.

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:47.210
This painting of you

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:49.410
represents my wish for you.

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:51.930
I hope you can tend flowers,

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:53.890
keep a cat,

00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:56.730
nap on the porch,

00:23:57.960 --> 00:23:59.340
and live a peaceful life,

00:24:01.150 --> 00:24:02.450
even for just one day.

00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:12.300
I don't have the time

00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:13.860
to live like this

00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:16.020
for a full day,

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:18.060
but even half a day

00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:19.970
would be something.

00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:48.980
Mutton!

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:49.750
What would you like?

00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:51.220
Fresh mutton!

00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:52.720
Sesame seed cakes!

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:53.950
Hot sesame seed cakes!

00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:55.260
All fresh out of the oven!

00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:56.270
Sesame seed cakes!

00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:57.800
Sir, how much for the cakes?

00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:58.490
Two wen each.

00:24:59.130 --> 00:24:59.840
I'll take two.

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:00.560
All right.

00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:02.120
Here are your cakes.

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:03.240
Thank you.

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:04.480
Here you are, miss.

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:05.760
Here you go.

00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:06.950
Thank you.

00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:09.190
All right.

00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:09.910
Here.

00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:10.720
All right.

00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:11.520
Come again.

00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:13.800
Come on.

00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:17.690
The dishes are ready.

00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:19.250
Coming!

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:21.820
This courtyard hasn't been this lively in a long time.

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:22.820
- Here. - Thank you.

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:24.250
Not true.

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:25.490
When he was

00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:27.020
injured here last time,

00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:28.820
the place was crawling with Imperial Guards.

00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:29.540
It was...

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:34.930
Now,

00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:37.020
Bai Wan is leaving tomorrow.

00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:37.930
Let's have

00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:39.340
a proper gathering tonight

00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:40.300
before she leaves.

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:41.340
Cheers.

00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:45.540
Things had just started getting better for me...

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:46.470
Drink your wine.

00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:47.730
Why so much nonsense?

00:25:58.520 --> 00:25:59.930
Complete your missions,

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:01.620
and your good days will come.

00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:02.930
Eat.

00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:07.340
I'm relieved to hear you say that.

00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:09.060
In your letters,

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:11.020
you always wrote that you were alone.

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:12.930
Now you have friends around you.

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:19.620
I'll see you off tomorrow.

00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:21.690
So will I.

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:22.960
I...

00:26:27.910 --> 00:26:28.890
I'm at your command.

00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:35.250
I'm glad you'll see me off.

00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:37.250
But I still feel reluctant to leave

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:38.970
and somewhat regretful.

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:40.780
Nanwei Trough isn't far.

00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:42.540
It's not like you can't come back.

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.300
My regret

00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:49.250
is that I didn't find my family in Chang'an.

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:51.820
But I've come to understand now

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:54.140
that in a city this vast,

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.380
I may never find him

00:26:57.430 --> 00:26:58.340
in this lifetime.

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:05.940
I've been carrying a secret

00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:08.330
that only my parents

00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:10.060
and sister know.

00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:12.700
I was not born to my parents.

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:15.300
They took me in.

00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:18.060
When I was very young,

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:19.820
in a bitter winter,

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:22.780
a man brought me to the reed marsh.

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:26.060
I can no longer remember his face,

00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:27.540
his age,

00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:29.850
or whether he was my father,

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:31.650
uncle,

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:34.810
or brother.

00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:37.460
I only remember

00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:38.700
that he told me

00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:40.020
he was going to get a bowl of hot soup,

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:42.130
so we

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:44.810
wouldn't starve to death.

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:48.890
It was so cold

00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:51.610
and so late.

00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:54.850
I waited a long time.

00:27:56.030 --> 00:27:58.780
Brother, I'm so hungry.

00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:00.540
Come on.

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:02.210
Hold on a little longer.

00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:03.540
We're

00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:05.580
almost there.

00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:08.250
Then I will

00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:10.250
find you something to eat,

00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:11.690
all right?

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:21.300
Sister.

00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:22.140
Hey.

00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:23.300
Listen.

00:28:24.390 --> 00:28:25.730
Stay here and wait for me.

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:27.540
I'll go look for some hot soup

00:28:27.670 --> 00:28:28.620
and something to eat.

00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:30.860
Once you're full, you won't feel cold,

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:31.520
[Young Bai Wan]

00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:32.690
and we can keep going.

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:34.410
If someone comes,

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:35.890
hide in the reeds.

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:37.490
Don't make a sound,

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.170
and don't run away.

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:40.780
I'll be back soon.

00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:42.410
Do you understand?

00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:45.380
Wrap yourself well.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:46.780
Now get inside.

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:03.730
I saw a light

00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:05.730
in the distance.

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:09.020
It was so far away,

00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:11.730
yet somehow I felt

00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:14.970
it could warm me.

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:18.020
So I walked toward the house

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:20.970
where that light was shining.

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:28.730
That is my earliest memory.

00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:30.380
From then on,

00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:32.970
I became the younger daughter of that family.

00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:35.170
They told me the truth about my origins,

00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:37.740
yet still treated me as their own.

00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:39.500
My sister

00:29:40.550 --> 00:29:41.890
treated me with great kindness.

00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:44.170
But I know

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:46.740
and remember

00:29:50.270 --> 00:29:51.700
that I was the one who left him behind.

00:29:56.550 --> 00:29:57.850
I chose to leave.

00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:01.610
And the price was

00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:04.940
losing my only family member,

00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:10.130
forgetting my roots,

00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:12.510
my surname,

00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:15.060
and my given name,

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:16.980
and never knowing

00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:19.890
whether the family who lost their daughter

00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:21.980
would go on

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:25.700
to live a good life.

00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:28.020
That is my regret.

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:30.980
My life

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:31.980
began

00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:33.370
with a wrong parting.

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:37.540
Life

00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:39.980
is not just made of mistakes.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.090
Sometimes just staying alive

00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:44.220
is a kind of fortune.

00:30:58.440 --> 00:30:59.090
I'm fine.

00:30:59.110 --> 00:31:00.300
Years have passed.

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:16.260
When I was unconscious,

00:31:16.790 --> 00:31:17.890
I vaguely heard

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:20.460
that this protective charm was something you had carried

00:31:20.550 --> 00:31:21.940
since you were old enough to remember.

00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:23.610
Perhaps

00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:26.690
it is your only link to your original family.

00:31:27.550 --> 00:31:28.650
You are about to travel far.

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:30.130
Take it back.

00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:32.130
Keep it with you,

00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:34.700
as if your family is still by your side.

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:50.610
Why do you all

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:52.610
look so down?

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:53.460
Come on.

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:54.610
Raise your cups.

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:56.460
Bai Wan leaves tomorrow.

00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:59.090
May she be safe and well,

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:00.370
and may everything go her way.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:25.780
Sister!

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:27.200
Sister!

00:32:27.770 --> 00:32:29.190
Look what I brought...

00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:34.460
Sister?

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:36.740
Sister!

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:38.130

00:32:48.090 --> 00:32:49.610
Sister!

00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:50.870
You must be starving.

00:32:51.090 --> 00:32:51.880
Eat this first.

00:32:52.050 --> 00:32:53.780
I'll heat a bowl of noodle soup for you.

00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:56.810
Here.

00:32:58.240 --> 00:32:58.810
Eat.

00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:00.320
Wait, wash your hands first.

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:01.080

00:33:04.930 --> 00:33:06.800
- then you'll be our child. - Try one.

00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:08.980
Slow down.

00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:10.830
Have another bite.

00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:12.770
- You must be starving. - Your face is all red.

00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:14.570
Slow down...

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:15.650
Don't choke.

even as an outsider, I can't stand watching this.

00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:35.410
Are you really not going

00:33:35.410 --> 00:33:36.450
to tell Bai Wan you're her brother?

00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:38.540
Turns out she's been carrying

00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:39.730
this regret all this time.

00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:41.820
Why don't you just tell her

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.100
you've been

00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:44.690
guarding her in secret

00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:45.970
all these years?

00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:55.620

00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:11.780
your mood today?

00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:14.650
Do I get cooked

00:35:15.590 --> 00:35:17.100
or raw food?

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:32.370
Back then,

00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:35.370
you wouldn't even spare a little girl.

00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:39.140
These years buried in the earth

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:41.540
are the punishment her brother gave you.

00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:44.330
It ends today.
