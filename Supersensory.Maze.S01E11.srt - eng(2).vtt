Monkey told Gao

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:13.800
about the video, right?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:14.840
Also, the ledger.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:16.350
Give me what I want,

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.640
and I'll give you what you want.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.190
How about it?

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.350
The deaths of Zhao Xueli and Hu Bo

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.070
are related to you, right?

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:27.870
You can keep

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:29.960
these words to trick them.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:32.330
What kind of sweet talk

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.110
did Hou Liangyuan give you?

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.280
You want to threaten me with these?

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.150
If it weren't for me,

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.450
would you be where you are today?

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.560
Mr. Mai, how sophisticated.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.520
Eating hotpot in an unfinished building.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.790
This isn't a trap, is it?

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.230
Hou.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.710
Mr. Mai, don't twist the truth.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.200
If it weren't for us,

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.030
could you have what you have today?

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.790
You can't forget old friends

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.350
once you get successful.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.480
I know you want money.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:14.710
Zhao Xueli's death

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:15.950
has nothing to do with me.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.150
After he died,

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.200
I suffered the greatest loss.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.710
I couldn't even take cash out
of the company.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.350
Apart from cash flow,

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.590
you must have other assets, right?

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.950
That's right, Mr. Mai.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.280
We also need to clean up and go legit

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.680
to let money make more money.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.520
We

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:35.920
are not greedy.

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.400
That resort in the suburbs

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.590
would be perfect.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:41.350
In addition,

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:42.840
you can give us

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.430
30 million, right?

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.520
Okay.

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:50.230
Let me find out

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:51.370
whether you're lying or not.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.520
The video.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.000
I'm surprised.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.590
Gao really knows how to play.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.920
None of the girls trained by him

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.910
is good.

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.150
You've seen our sincerity.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.470
What about yours?

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.500

(Divorce Agreement)

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.870
Hello.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.590
May I ask if you are Xu Yi's wife?

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.150
Shi Zelin, Zhang Chao, and Han Kuo

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.240
grew up together

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.360
in Lujia Village.

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:50.260
(Victims: Xu Yi, Zhang Chao, Han Kuo)
They came to Wuyang to work.

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:51.050
Shi Zelin used drugs

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:52.260
due to Zhang Chao's inducement.

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.030
He entered the rehab center
two years ago

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.520
and was released over four months ago.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.200
Half a year ago, Zhang Chao

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.340
opened a car wash shop.

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:59.690
Han Kuo is his business partner.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.400
As for the third victim, Xu Yi,

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.750
he was the owner of a clubhouse

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:04.840
called Jinmengwan.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.710
Their relationship

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.910
is still unknown.

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.130
Could it be that they

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:10.270
were gathering to take drugs

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:11.910
and were retaliated against
by Shi Zelin?

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:13.960
No traces of drugs were detected

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.000
in any of the four bodies,

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.560
and no relevant tools were left

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.480
at the scene.

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:20.390
Have you found Ge Feifei?

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:21.680
Yes.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.120
On the morning of that day,

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.370
Shi Zelin went to the hospital

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:25.190
to visit a woman.

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.070
It was Ge Feifei.

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.120
No physical problems.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.680
But she was not in a good mental state.

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:30.310
Also,

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.190
the TIT found

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.240
footprints of a fifth person
at the scene.

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:34.710
These footprints were also found

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:35.750
next to Shi Zelin's body.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:38.870
I'll investigate this fifth person.

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:39.710
Yes.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.160
Captain He,

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.000
Xu Yi's family has come
to identify the body.

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:44.460
Let her wait for a while.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.400
Yes.

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.040
You two,

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.390
go to Xu Yi's clubhouse

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:49.950
and see if he and Ge Feifei

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.750
have any connection with Shi Zelin.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.370
I'll go to Lujia Village later.

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:08.030
It's him.

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:11.030
My condolences.

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:14.430
Can I stay with him

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:15.470
for a little while longer?

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:40.560
Officer,

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.750
I have something to tell you.

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:52.360
Is it

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.300
about Xu Yi's clubhouse?

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.480
Hurry up.

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:00.670
Come here, come on.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.040
Hurry up.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.800
The case is currently
under investigation.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.480
We will continue

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.260
to follow up.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:08.560
We also remind the general public

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.040
to enhance safety awareness.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.000
If there are any leads,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.800
please report them to the police.

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.160
You killed Xu Yi, right?

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:20.630
I also have a question.

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:23.240
Xu Yi is dead.

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.680
Where is the USB drive?

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:27.800
The resort has been transferred.

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:29.800
Are you going to go back on your word

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.350
and refuse to give me the video, right?

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:34.390
Don't forget there's still 30 million.

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:37.920
Mr. Mai,

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:39.870
how can you say that?

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:41.870
Don't think I don't know

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:42.830
your little scheme.

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:44.670
Hou Liangyuan,

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:47.160
I've handed over the stuff.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.800
I don't care who has it.

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:52.190
Gao is already angry.

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:54.680
Give me the USB drive within three days,

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:56.680
and I'll transfer the money to you.

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:57.980
(Enter the password)
Otherwise,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.310
you will be the next Xu Yi.

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:00.420
(Wrong password)

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:01.680
Officer He, you know

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.190
Angel Training Center, right?

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:05.730
This school

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:07.240
was actually a public welfare project

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.080
founded by me.

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:09.800
The principal managed it.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.920
Some time ago,
I went to check the accounts.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:14.750
But I discovered

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:15.830
that for his clubhouse,

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:17.430
Xu Yi took my students...

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:24.360
Over the years,

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.000
many girls have been tricked by him.

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:28.600
So, you shut down the school?

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.580
I can't let my hard work

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:30.420
be ruined like this.

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:33.390
Before this happened,

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:34.920
you had no idea at all?

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.000
I didn't know.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.240
I had absolutely no idea.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:38.480
If I had known,

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.780
I would've divorced him long ago.

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:40.950
And when I found out

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:42.000
about this matter,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.100
I wished I could kill him.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.050
I did not hire someone to kill.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.640
Don't get the wrong idea.

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:49.630
We police handle cases

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:50.470
based on evidence.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.260
(Enter the password
to unlock this drive)

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:56.100
(Wrong password)

00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:58.030
Mr. Mai,

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.430
I have the USB drive.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.540
(Wrong password)
But Xu Yi encrypted it.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:03.480
I can't open it.

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:06.040
At that time, you showed me

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.430
a video clip.

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:08.870
Do you think that after Xu Yi died,

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:10.160
you can just raise the price?

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:14.240
Just give me the USB drive.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.040
I'll find someone to decrypt it.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.360
We'll only know after opening it

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.030
whether what you said is true or false.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.750
Your job is about art investment.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.720
Why would you found

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:26.190
a nursing project?

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:27.570
18 years ago,

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:28.800
I had a car accident.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.430
At that time,

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:31.750
I was saved by a girl

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:32.590
studying nursing.

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:35.240
I've been looking for her.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.160
Unfortunately,

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.800
I have never been able to find her.

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:40.270
To thank her,

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.720
I founded this school.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:44.770
Could you provide the student records

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:46.250
of previous years at the school?

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.200
Sure.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:48.740
Thanks for your cooperation.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.200
Well, Officer He.

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:51.590
I have something else

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.630
I need to show you.

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:55.720
When I was investigating Xu Yi,

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.600
I discovered he had a hidden partner.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:58.910
It's the person in the photo.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.000
Do you know his name?

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.630
No, I've never seen him before.

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:10.120
The resort hasn't been transferred

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.080
to me.

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.720
What if I give you the USB drive

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:14.360
and you change your mind?

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:16.390
Don't try to play tricks on me.

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:18.150
Gao's patience is limited.

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:19.990
If you don't hand over the USB drive,

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:20.830
another death

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:21.960
is nothing.

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:39.800
We were married for 9 years.

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:41.910
At first, we were very sweet.

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:43.670
I really didn't expect

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:45.680
the man who once lay beside me

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:47.790
would have such an ugly side.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:51.390
Go back and get some rest.

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:53.390
Thanks, Officer He.

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:54.680
Thank you.

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:02.040
(2:00 pm: material delivery)

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.360
(Previous records, Wang Zhuowei)

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:05.740
(Fingerprint sample)

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:08.920
Recently,

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:10.360
we've been monitoring

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:11.840
him and him.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.200
We discovered

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:15.440
that they...

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:18.390
Mr. Xu,

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:20.110
what's wrong?

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:21.550
Where is Captain He?

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:22.390
She went out.

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:24.350
You brought food?

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:26.590
Get back to work.

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:44.380
(Police)

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:46.030
As for Mai Boyuan and Xu Yi,

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:47.390
Mai Boyuan

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:48.960
often goes to Jinmengwan Karaoke.

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:50.440
There must be

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:51.960
some quid pro quo between them.

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:54.750
So, I think

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:56.630
we should start with this.

00:10:58.720 --> 00:10:59.560
Director Feng.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.380
See you tonight at the usual place.

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:06.360
I didn't expect

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:09.240
Zelin to meet such a tragic end.

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:11.960
Can we

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.200
bring him back?

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:14.440
Yes.

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.550
You'll be notified
after the case is closed.

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:20.790
Did Zelin really do this?

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.840
Why are you saying this now?

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:24.750
Give me back my son.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.080
- Give him back.
- What are you doing?

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:27.920
Ma'am, don't do this.

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:29.480
- Ma'am, calm down.
- Give him back.

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:30.390
Calm down.

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:32.080
- Come here.
- Sorry.

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:33.440
You're being ridiculous!

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.440
Ridiculous!

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.030
I'm being ridiculous?

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:38.390
How dare you say that?

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.320
If you hadn't taken Xu Yi

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.910
to the hair salon

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:42.960
when Xu Yi was little,

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.100
would he have gone bad?

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:45.360
- Nonsense.
- It's your fault.

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:46.870
- Stop talking nonsense.
- Ma'am.

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:48.000
It's the hair salon.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.750
You, Mai Boyuan, and Hou Liangyuan

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:51.910
did so many rotten things
behind the village.

00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:53.840
Who in the whole village doesn't know?

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:55.000
Who doesn't know?

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:56.600
I just don't know.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:57.550
Tell me. Who knows?

00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:59.440
Everyone knew the hair salon

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.390
was actually a brothel.

00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:03.910
You frequented there

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:05.750
and even brought Xu Yi

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:08.150
when he was so young.

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:10.080
Weren't you just trying

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.230
to turn him into a hooligan?

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:12.360
You're slandering me.

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:13.440
On the surface,

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:17.790
Mai Boyuan is a construction contractor.

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:20.080
Actually, he is just a pimp.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.360
Hou claims to be

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:24.150
in the building materials business.

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:25.840
Why does he keep so many thugs?

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:26.910
- Stop.
- Say it.

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:28.080
- Stop it.
- What's he doing?

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.440
- Stop talking.
- Stop it.

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:30.450
We've lost our son,

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:31.410
and I'm saying nonsense?

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:32.260
Ma'am, let go.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:33.680
- What are you doing?
- Let go.

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:36.030
Such a big incident happened.

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:37.590
How dare you

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:38.920
cause trouble at someone's home?

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.290
Hurry back.

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:44.000
Let's go back.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.380
- You have hypertension.
- Let go.

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:45.920
Heavens...

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:46.780
Let go of me.

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:47.830
We've lost my son.

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:48.960
Why are you still alive?

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:50.630
- Sorry.
- Why are you still alive?

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:52.350
Sorry.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.390
I am the village chief of Lujia Village.

00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:55.470
My name is Lu Haitao.

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.440
Can you tell us in detail

00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:58.280
about the hair salon

00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:59.720
that Xu Yi's mother mentioned?

00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:02.920
It happened over 20 years ago.

00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:05.150
Our village committee

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:06.770
encouraged everyone to start businesses.

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:08.550
In the beginning,

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:09.750
there were many difficulties.

00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:11.360
Mai Boyuan

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:12.960
was the first to come here

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:13.800
to build a factory.

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:15.000
If it weren't for him,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.940
our village wouldn't have developed
so quickly.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:17.960
Hou Liangyuan

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:19.110
is a construction contractor

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:19.990
under Mr. Mai.

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:21.720
His workers

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:23.080
came here

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:24.470
to carry out civil engineering work.

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:26.840
The hair salon she mentioned

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.030
is the current barbershop.

00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:30.510
Young girls dressed a bit nicely.

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:31.840
The villagers misunderstood.

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.030
Are these houses still inhabited now?

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:35.690
This one is inhabited.

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:37.150
That house is uninhabited.

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:39.030
That is Lu Youliang's home.

00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:41.210
He never came back
after being released from prison.

00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:42.660
The house has been vacant all along.

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:57.720
Zheng Xintao should have

00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:59.360
photos of illegal sexual bribery.

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:01.300
This should be the reason

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:02.370
behind his death.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.150
Zhang Yutong's painting

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.030
is the reason
why all of Zheng Xintao's cameras

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:08.030
disappeared from his home.

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:09.870
I think the one photographed

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:10.870
is the missing ledger

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:12.040
of the trafficking syndicate.

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:16.080
Take it back

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:17.790
for the technicians to evaluate.

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:25.790
Sorry

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.320
about your punishment.

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:28.590
Undercover.

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:29.920
I understand.

00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:31.750
You must dig out everyone

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:32.600
behind Hou Liangyuan

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:33.960
through him

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:35.840
and eradicate this trafficking gang.

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:36.750
So far,

00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:38.820
all the evidence in the Shi Zelin Case

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:39.670
is clear and explicit.

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:40.910
No remaining doubts.

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:42.390
The case is declared solved.

00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:45.840
Should we dig deeper into the business

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:46.750
behind Xu Yi?

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:47.840
Continue.

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:49.890
This lead runs in parallel
with routine work.

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:51.720
This is highly likely to be

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:53.080
a large criminal organization.

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:54.790
We'll combine the Hu Bo Case

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.260
and this lead for investigation.

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:58.370
Also, work with the tech dept.

00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:00.100
(Abduction; Rape)
to confirm the identity

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:01.810
of the women
in Jinmengwan's surveillance.

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:03.440
Find them and arrange questioning.

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:04.510
Understood.

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:05.590
Liu Ming,

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:07.790
compile all those phone calls.

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:12.940
(Fellow townsmen;
Lured by Zhang Chao into drug use)

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:14.620
(Abduction; Rape)

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:31.080
Hello.

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:32.850
- Have a seat.
- Mr. Hou.

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:37.750
Is this an interrogation?

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:40.600
It's my colleague's work habit.

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:44.440
This resort is quite deserted.

00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:46.750
It hasn't opened yet?

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:50.670
I just took over here,

00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:52.480
and this happened.

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:54.600
To be honest with you,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.200
Xu Yi managed

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:58.080
this resort.

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:00.630
I held a title

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:02.030
and collected a share.

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:04.120
You trusted Xu Yi so much.

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:05.600
You two must be very close.

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:08.480
That's not true.

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:10.150
Business is business.

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:13.120
Xu Yi's clubhouse business

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:14.120
is doing so well.

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:16.360
He is experienced in management.

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:19.080
This is what I appreciate the most.

00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:21.150
How did you meet each other?

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:24.630
In the past,

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:26.510
I used to run a small business

00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:27.720
in building materials,

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.960
so I'd entertain clients with drinks.

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:33.360
I met Xu Yi at a gathering.

00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:36.600
I've also been
to Jinmengwan a few times.

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:38.200
I'm not educated.

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:40.270
Doing business and making friends

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:42.240
are all about a good first impression.

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:45.030
Xu Yi's business was doing so well,

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:46.200
so I invited him to come

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:48.320
to work with me on this resort.

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:50.480
Xu Yi's Jinmengwan was found

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:51.740
to be involved in prostitution.

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:52.960
Do you know that?

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:54.630
That's impossible.

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:57.120
Xu Yi looked very upright.

00:16:57.510 --> 00:16:58.590
Otherwise, I wouldn't have

00:16:58.590 --> 00:16:59.710
partnered with him.

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:02.790
Could there be

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:03.870
some misunderstanding here?

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:05.790
Do you have contact with Mai Boyuan?

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:09.440
We lost contact long ago.

00:17:10.110 --> 00:17:12.640
He's now very successful.

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:14.030
He probably

00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:15.200
doesn't remember us anymore.

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:19.680
I heard that 20 years ago,

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.830
you partnered up in Lujia Village

00:17:21.830 --> 00:17:23.030
to open a hair salon.

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:27.680
What kind of business was that?

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:28.750
Are we criminals?

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:31.330
We're doing you a favor
by answering your questions.

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:32.610
You'd better appreciate it.

00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:34.310
This is a routine inquiry.

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:42.440
Who taught you

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:43.790
to treat the police this way?

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:46.200
Didn't you hear the young officer?

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:47.640
A routine inquiry.

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:49.720
Apologize.

00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:53.190
I was wrong.

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:55.590
Officers, I'm sorry.

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:01.750
Where were we just now?

00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:02.950
Hair salon.

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:05.070
Right.

00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:07.830
A hair salon is definitely

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:09.110
about the hair-washing business.

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:10.200
What else

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.750
could it be?

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:14.670
Alright.

00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:16.200
Thanks for your cooperation.

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:17.880
We may come to you again

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:18.720
to learn more.

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:20.540
If you have anything you want to say,

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:21.790
you can call us anytime.

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:24.110
Song,

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:25.550
see the two officers off.

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:26.830
I'll stay here then.

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.240
Alright.

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:36.720
Mr. Hou.

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:38.880
Xu Yi is dead,

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.510
but you don't seem sad.

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:43.880
You saw it.

00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:45.830
The resort has ended up like this.

00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:48.350
There's no time for me to be sad.

00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:53.480
I hide the sorrow in my heart.

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:15.200
We need to get rid of this batch asap.

00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:18.510
Don't bring in any more for now.

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:21.440
Have the police got their eyes on you?

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:24.400
But they have no evidence.

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:28.240
To be safe,

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:31.720
I should get a new identity.

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:35.750
It's not easy to get a new identity now.

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:37.310
I can only turn to Mai Boyuan.

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:40.830
I hold his life in my hands.

00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:58.240
Ms. Liang.

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:01.310
Ms. Liang, Mr. Mai is not here.

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.920
Ms. Liang, Mr. Mai really isn't here.

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:07.240
Ms. Liang.

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:10.790
Ms. Zhao, I'm sorry.

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:14.430
It's fine; you may leave.

00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:15.670
Where is Mai Boyuan?

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:18.440
Mr. Mai is not here.

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:20.240
You can tell me what you need.

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:23.550
Who do you think you are?

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:24.920
What's the use of you?

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.310
Then there's nothing we can do.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.480
Mr. Mai has been very busy lately.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.680
He can't meet you this month.

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:36.040
Too busy?

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:38.850
What is Mai Boyuan busy with?

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:41.830
Busy getting Xu Yi to do dirty work?

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:45.000
They even used my school.

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:46.040
Has he ever thought

00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:47.790
about what I would do
if this were exposed?

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.440
Why should I take the blame?

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:54.480
About this...

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.070
Are you very happy

00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:57.350
Xu Yi is dead?

00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:01.910
Indeed.

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:03.070
You came

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:04.680
just to distance yourself.

00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:06.430
I understand.

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:08.830
When disaster strikes, everyone flees.

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:18.080
Zhao Xin,

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:20.510
don't gloat.

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:23.310
You are just

00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:24.260
Mai Boyuan's plaything.

00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:27.070
When a real disaster comes,

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:28.920
will you be able to flee?

00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:38.720
Tell Mai Boyuan to contact me asap.

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:40.240
Otherwise, his paintings abroad

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:41.200
won't be sold.

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:57.000
Have you asked the bank?

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:01.000
They said your current assets

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:01.920
have been frozen.

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:05.550
They'll apply to the court

00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:06.550
to auction the resort

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:07.950
as collateral.

00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:10.910
My phone.

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:18.610
I never said
I wouldn't give you the USB drive.

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.130
If you cut off my source of income,

00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:21.650
aren't you afraid I'll do the worst?

00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:23.430
Hou Liangyuan,

00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:25.270
do you really think

00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:26.680
that this USB drive

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:28.590
can let you

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:29.530
manipulate me endlessly?

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:31.550
I've given you the resort

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:32.790
and a new identity.

00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:34.000
Yet, still no USB drive.

00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:36.110
This time, it's a warning.

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:38.270
Next time,

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:39.960
I'm not sure.

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:42.610
Since you don't want to give it to me,

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:44.030
just wait.

00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:56.350
How is your task going?

00:22:56.790 --> 00:22:58.040
We can take action at any time.

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:01.970
Let's wait a little longer.

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:14.040
Yin.

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.270
Obviously, Hou Liangyuan

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:18.310
didn't tell us the truth.

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:20.070
He invested in Xu Yi

00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:21.030
and went to Jinmengwan.

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:34.760
Sir.

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:35.760
Mr. Xu is here.

00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:37.350
Long time no see.

00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:38.190
Yes.

00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:39.590
Two bowls of lamb chop noodles.

00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:41.160
No cilantro, only scallions.

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:42.000
Please have a seat.

00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:43.190
Mr. Xu.

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:44.760
I brought a friend.

00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:47.510
- Mr. Xu.
- Have a seat.

00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:49.830
The century-old diner you mentioned?

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:51.070
Yes.

00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:52.110
Have a taste.

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:55.240
Sit.

00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:01.960
How's the case going?

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:03.550
We just went...

00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:04.400
Well.

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:06.160
He can't inquire about the case.

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:14.240
It's only been two days,

00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:16.160
yet an old colleague

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:18.030
is so indifferent to you.

00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:23.440
I haven't found the chance

00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:25.400
to thank both of you in person

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:27.000
for the matter last time.

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:28.660
It's part of the duty.

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:34.800
Mr. Xu.

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:36.560
Thank you.

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:43.800
Have a bite?

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:45.590
- Officer Liu.
- Too gamey.

00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:46.430
Have a bite.

00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:51.450
They remove the gamy smell

00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:52.550
with several procedures.

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:56.440
First, soak it in salt water.

00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:59.480
Get the amount of salt just right.

00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:01.400
Too little salt won't remove the smell.

00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:03.060
Too much salt will make the meat tough.

00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:06.920
Green onions, ginger, and garlic.

00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:08.110
Cooking wine.

00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:10.240
Some Sichuan peppercorns and tea leaves.

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:13.110
Soak in clean water for 30 minutes.

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:14.450
High heat for 40 minutes.

00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:16.070
Switch to low heat for 20 minutes.

00:25:16.270 --> 00:25:17.110
Serve.

00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:18.200
If possible,

00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:19.880
add a bit of rice vinegar.

00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:22.260
Giving a lecture about noodles, huh?

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:28.040
Yin,

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:30.590
as you said, we should observe life

00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:32.240
and accumulate experience so we can tell

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:33.350
at a glance, like you.

00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:35.440
Experience doesn't come
from rigid books.

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:38.560
This gamey smell

00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:40.200
is actually

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:42.270
the fatty acid in the lamb.

00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:44.350
When the lamb is dead,

00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:45.750
they still need to please people

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:47.200
by covering up

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:48.200
and neutralizing.

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:49.750
Even so,

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:51.200
someone just dislikes it.

00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:54.960
Just enjoy yourself, right?

00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:56.480
Why force others?

00:25:56.830 --> 00:25:57.670
We don't do that.

00:25:58.480 --> 00:25:59.320
Let's go.

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:02.280
Mr. Xu.

00:26:05.790 --> 00:26:06.630
Yin.

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:16.110
Do you think this lamb tastes gamey?

00:26:18.570 --> 00:26:20.780
Boss, this is the sheep's blood
for making tofu today.

00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:21.830
Do you think it's enough?

00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:22.800
Maybe they screwed it up.

00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:23.970
That's enough; put it there.

00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:38.750
Isn't the cop

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:40.480
who investigated the case?

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:46.750
The suspect jumped off a building,

00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:48.070
and you're still having noodles?

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:49.860
I remember I said it before:

00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:51.100
Filming without permission

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:52.210
is illegal.

00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:58.800
- Bill.
- Okay.

00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:01.110
You're done?

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:07.310
You caused me to lose my job.

00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:11.340
How dare you give me a lecture?

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:18.400
You owe me.

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:25.080
Not worth it.

00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:29.430
Just you wait.

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:31.720
Not worth it.

00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:32.950
Not worth it.

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:45.240
Sir.

00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:47.510
Mr. Xu, sorry about that.

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:53.280
You're back.

00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:57.370
Taking a shower at this hour?

00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:58.690
Did you bring a woman home?

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:01.070
You're already back.

00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:02.110
She doesn't need to come.

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:09.640
Do you remember Shi Zelin?

00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:12.670
Of course.

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:14.110
The one with a history of drug use.

00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:15.250
He's quite grateful to you.

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:20.880
What's your view on this case?

00:28:22.510 --> 00:28:23.480
Asking

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:24.950
a suspended police officer?

00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:26.790
That's against the rules, right?

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:31.200
You're so by-the-book?

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:33.440
Isn't it because of you?

00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:40.260
Ever since you came back,
we haven't had a break.

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:41.830
All cases were complicated.

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:43.640
Once you got suspended,

00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:44.990
the cases became simple again.

00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:46.720
That's good.

00:28:47.210 --> 00:28:48.920
Sounds like you're about
to solve the case.

00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:54.440
Where are the shoes I gave you

00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:55.590
when we got married?

00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:04.190
Those

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:05.840
Cardin shoes?

00:29:06.510 --> 00:29:07.350
That's right.

00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:08.910
I still have them.

00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:12.000
Back then,

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.240
to buy that pair of shoes,

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:15.070
you freeloaded food and drinks

00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:15.910
for two months

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:17.480
and borrowed 2,000 yuan.

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:19.080
It cost 8,000.

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:20.560
Too expensive.

00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:23.550
How come I've never seen you wear it?

00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:26.000
I only wear it on formal occasions.

00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:28.150
Besides,

00:29:28.510 --> 00:29:30.000
you don't often show up

00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:31.830
at my formal occasions.

00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:33.750
My cousin is getting married.

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:35.110
I can bring a plus-one.

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:38.790
Dress smartly.

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:40.240
Absolutely.

00:29:41.270 --> 00:29:43.240
I sent those shoes
for maintenance yesterday.

00:29:44.270 --> 00:29:45.610
I'll pick them up this afternoon.

00:29:48.510 --> 00:29:49.150
Oh, right.

00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:51.020
I'll go to the changing room
to get clothes.

00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:51.910
Almost forgot.

00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:58.240
Dress warmer.

00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:00.350
Got it.

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:07.780
Don't forget to pick up the shoes.

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:10.000
I won't forget.

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:15.680
Will you be back tomorrow?

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:17.720
Yes.

00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:19.250
What do you feel like eating?

00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:20.510
I'm free anyway.

00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:23.240
It's up to you.

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:25.680
No problem.

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:27.590
I'm off.

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:30.280
Goodbye.

00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:31.590
How about fish?

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:32.560
Carp?

00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:50.680
It seems Officer He

00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:51.960
doesn't really trust you.

00:30:56.110 --> 00:30:57.790
Your relationship is so strange.

00:30:59.110 --> 00:31:00.260
You're divorced for ten years

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:02.570
and are now living together again.

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:08.960
You became a witness to a murder case,

00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:11.440
investigating the case privately

00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:13.680
but not telling her.

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:16.880
She is both suspicious of you

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:17.790
and testing you.

00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:20.830
Speaking of which,

00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:23.110
did she move in

00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:23.960
so

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:25.110
she can

00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:26.960
monitor you?

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:32.620
You've taken your bath.

00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:34.390
You can leave now.

00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:39.190
Goodbye.

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:40.280
I'm leaving.
