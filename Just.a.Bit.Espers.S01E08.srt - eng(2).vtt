00:00:17.872 --> 00:00:19.916
The Holo Link Communicator

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.461
I had them build
in this era is finally complete.

00:00:24.504 --> 00:00:26.297
My body,

00:00:26.923 --> 00:00:28.341
eyes, and ears…

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.718
I finally obtained it.

00:00:31.553 --> 00:00:33.930
A 120-degree field of view.

00:00:34.556 --> 00:00:36.307
Not too inconvenient.

00:00:39.144 --> 00:00:41.312
I cannot touch anything,

00:00:41.396 --> 00:00:43.690
but I can make it look like I'm sitting.

00:00:45.441 --> 00:00:48.236
Everything I perceive
through the Holo Link Communicator

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:51.197
is sent back to me in 2055.

00:00:52.407 --> 00:00:53.533
And then…

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:57.787
I finally saw her.

00:00:59.956 --> 00:01:01.082
With my own eyes.

00:01:02.584 --> 00:01:04.752
Shiki in 2025.

00:01:07.255 --> 00:01:10.300
Shiki… Alive.

00:01:13.553 --> 00:01:14.762
Let's reinstall it again.

00:01:15.471 --> 00:01:16.389
If I drink it…

00:01:16.472 --> 00:01:18.391
I'll forget the last six months?

00:01:18.474 --> 00:01:20.894
Yes, and everything
will go back to normal.

00:01:24.188 --> 00:01:25.356
Okay.

00:01:27.775 --> 00:01:28.902
Goodbye.

00:01:34.365 --> 00:01:35.825
Bunty is Bunta.

00:01:36.701 --> 00:01:40.455
My Bunty is Bunta! Not you.

00:01:44.792 --> 00:01:46.169
I'm surprised.

00:01:48.379 --> 00:01:49.547
This can't be happening…

00:01:51.174 --> 00:01:52.800
It's the perfect opportunity.

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:55.053
Let's talk about Nonamare.

00:01:56.095 --> 00:01:57.430
All of you

00:01:58.056 --> 00:01:59.766
were chosen by me.

00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:01.726
Under what conditions?

00:02:02.852 --> 00:02:04.979
That is to be outside the decision tree.

00:02:06.397 --> 00:02:08.524
Whether you exist or not
doesn't change anything.

00:02:08.608 --> 00:02:11.444
If I hadn't given you E-Capsules,

00:02:12.987 --> 00:02:15.490
all of you would have died this year.

00:02:17.533 --> 00:02:19.035
Non amare.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.497
You must not love.

00:02:24.874 --> 00:02:26.334
Because none of you…

00:02:28.878 --> 00:02:30.588
were needed.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.808
Ohsuke, I'm firing you.

00:02:43.893 --> 00:02:45.603
Mrs. Enjaku and Hanzo.

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:47.480
You two are fired as well.

00:02:48.398 --> 00:02:51.109
You kept failing to report things,

00:02:51.192 --> 00:02:52.694
and you abandoned your mission.

00:02:53.361 --> 00:02:55.363
Thank you for your service.

00:02:55.863 --> 00:02:58.992
Vacate your housing by tomorrow.

00:03:00.034 --> 00:03:03.538
Go wherever you please.

00:03:05.915 --> 00:03:07.250
Bunta,

00:03:08.251 --> 00:03:09.919
come to Nonamare tomorrow.

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:26.310
Bunty, you don't have to go.

00:03:27.937 --> 00:03:30.064
Everyone, don't worry about it.

00:03:30.857 --> 00:03:34.902
You're all important.
You're not unnecessary!

00:03:44.495 --> 00:03:45.663
Ohsuke!

00:03:46.748 --> 00:03:47.790
Oh!

00:03:47.874 --> 00:03:48.833
-Ohsuke!
-You okay?

00:03:49.751 --> 00:03:51.002
It's nothing.

00:03:52.503 --> 00:03:54.005
-Ohsuke!
-Ohsuke!

00:03:54.088 --> 00:03:55.423
-Hey!
-Come on! Ohsuke!

00:03:55.506 --> 00:03:57.216
-Ohsuke!
-You okay?

00:03:57.842 --> 00:03:59.427
-Ohsuke!
-Hey!

00:04:01.512 --> 00:04:02.722
Here.

00:04:02.805 --> 00:04:04.974
Got it. Thanks.

00:04:07.143 --> 00:04:10.730
Sasuke says Ohsuke has a strange smell.

00:04:11.481 --> 00:04:14.150
He says we all have it,

00:04:15.026 --> 00:04:16.527
but Ohsuke's is the strongest,

00:04:16.611 --> 00:04:18.196
then Mrs. Enjaku,

00:04:18.738 --> 00:04:21.366
then me, then Bunta.

00:04:21.866 --> 00:04:25.036
Shiki-san only has a faint trace of it.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.413
It's the order we became Espers.

00:04:34.045 --> 00:04:35.171
Is it because of these?

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.093
Side effects.

00:04:43.679 --> 00:04:45.098
Yes.

00:04:45.973 --> 00:04:47.558
It's possible.

00:04:48.643 --> 00:04:53.064
The E-Capsules are not
approved yet in the future.

00:04:54.482 --> 00:04:57.777
Everyone who became an Esper

00:04:58.861 --> 00:05:00.321
before us died.

00:05:01.406 --> 00:05:04.325
-Why?
-Did you hear that from Kujo?

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:05.993
I'm asking you.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.956
Did they die from the E-Capsules?

00:05:13.334 --> 00:05:16.921
True. All first-generation Espers

00:05:17.588 --> 00:05:19.048
have died.

00:05:20.007 --> 00:05:22.802
We didn't know
the proper dosage back then.

00:05:23.678 --> 00:05:26.472
There might have been issues
with the compounds we used.

00:05:28.141 --> 00:05:30.101
You knew it was dangerous

00:05:31.811 --> 00:05:33.521
and still made us take them?

00:05:33.604 --> 00:05:36.482
People who were going to die anyway…

00:05:39.152 --> 00:05:41.028
died from side effects.

00:05:41.863 --> 00:05:43.573
Why be angry?

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.304
I'm returning this.

00:06:06.929 --> 00:06:08.181
And also this.

00:06:13.436 --> 00:06:14.395
RESIGNATION LETTER

00:06:14.478 --> 00:06:15.855
My resignation letter.

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:19.192
Not that you can touch it.

00:06:22.653 --> 00:06:24.363
Please complete the mission.

00:06:27.867 --> 00:06:29.952
Only you can do it.

00:06:37.043 --> 00:06:39.337
I'm not doing it!

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:40.588
You will.

00:06:42.965 --> 00:06:45.760
Just as I have no choice
but to rewrite the past,

00:06:47.011 --> 00:06:48.179
you also have no choice.

00:06:49.472 --> 00:06:51.349
You must complete this mission.

00:07:03.569 --> 00:07:06.239
Were you okay? Did you quit?

00:07:09.784 --> 00:07:11.160
You won't have to see him again?

00:07:15.456 --> 00:07:16.374
Good.

00:07:18.501 --> 00:07:19.377
Let's go home.

00:07:31.264 --> 00:07:32.306
Takoyaki.

00:07:35.393 --> 00:07:37.061
I really want takoyaki.

00:08:07.842 --> 00:08:09.927
Please take care of them for a while.

00:08:10.011 --> 00:08:11.721
ANIMAL DAYCARE

00:08:13.014 --> 00:08:14.932
I'll come back for you.

00:08:15.016 --> 00:08:16.601
Be good, okay?

00:08:16.684 --> 00:08:17.602
I'm counting on you.

00:08:18.185 --> 00:08:20.521
It's okay. I'll be okay.

00:08:34.035 --> 00:08:35.328
Mrs. Enjaku,

00:08:36.662 --> 00:08:38.706
do you really not want to stay with us?

00:08:41.667 --> 00:08:45.087
That house was prepared
by President Kizashi.

00:08:46.005 --> 00:08:47.423
I don't want to owe him anything.

00:08:50.217 --> 00:08:52.219
Bunta taught me how to stay

00:08:52.303 --> 00:08:54.305
at an internet café, so I'll be fine.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.524
What am I…

00:09:08.277 --> 00:09:10.946
supposed to live for now?

00:09:17.912 --> 00:09:19.747
I remembered something.

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:20.915
CLOSED FOR BUSINESS
PLEASE TAKE FREELY - FLOWER SAKURAYA

00:09:21.832 --> 00:09:25.586
The reason why I'm able to bloom flowers.

00:09:28.339 --> 00:09:30.591
A child's eyes are beautiful, right?

00:09:31.634 --> 00:09:34.845
Untouched by anything dirty.

00:09:35.471 --> 00:09:38.140
They're so clear, they almost appear blue.

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:42.436
I wished that the world he saw
was something beautiful.

00:09:43.479 --> 00:09:44.772
So, I wanted to show him…

00:09:45.356 --> 00:09:47.108
beautiful things.

00:09:48.401 --> 00:09:49.694
That's why…

00:09:51.195 --> 00:09:53.072
I became an Esper who makes flowers bloom.

00:09:57.702 --> 00:09:58.953
But I was wrong.

00:10:02.331 --> 00:10:05.918
At the root,
I'm an Esper who might kill people.

00:10:06.419 --> 00:10:08.129
That's what I am.

00:10:11.716 --> 00:10:13.968
I scared Shion.

00:10:14.802 --> 00:10:16.178
I made him hate me.

00:10:20.015 --> 00:10:21.600
Who needs

00:10:24.019 --> 00:10:25.479
someone like that

00:10:28.315 --> 00:10:29.442
as a father?

00:10:37.199 --> 00:10:39.493
I lectured Shion.

00:10:39.577 --> 00:10:42.288
I told him to stop using his esper powers,
and to stop messing around.

00:10:43.956 --> 00:10:45.207
When I told him

00:10:45.291 --> 00:10:48.169
"I" disappeared again because of him,

00:10:48.252 --> 00:10:50.379
he was totally crushed.

00:10:51.797 --> 00:10:53.716
I regret saying too much.

00:10:54.967 --> 00:10:56.385
It's a good lesson for a kid, right?

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:00.931
"I" is still gone?

00:11:03.768 --> 00:11:05.144
Am I really going to die?

00:11:08.314 --> 00:11:09.607
You'll be fine.

00:11:10.649 --> 00:11:11.901
You lived

00:11:11.984 --> 00:11:14.612
until 2055 once already.

00:11:15.654 --> 00:11:17.156
You're not dying that easily.

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:24.079
This world has something like inertia.

00:11:26.499 --> 00:11:29.919
I know about inertia,
but why does that matter now?

00:11:30.628 --> 00:11:33.422
Altering history always causes pushback.

00:11:34.715 --> 00:11:36.342
The world tries to return

00:11:36.425 --> 00:11:39.553
to its original path.

00:11:40.221 --> 00:11:41.347
It's a theory.

00:11:44.016 --> 00:11:48.103
So you won't die that easily. Relax.

00:11:50.439 --> 00:11:54.109
First, stop taking the E-Capsules.

00:11:55.569 --> 00:11:58.906
I'm healing, and I told Shion
to stop taking them, too.

00:12:01.367 --> 00:12:04.453
So, Yanagi and the others didn't die
from someone's Esper attack,

00:12:04.537 --> 00:12:06.914
but from the side effects
of the E-capsule?

00:12:06.997 --> 00:12:09.833
Yeah. Kizashi admitted it.

00:12:09.917 --> 00:12:14.046
But Kizashi brought the recipe
for the E-capsules and had them made.

00:12:14.129 --> 00:12:16.173
He basically killed them, right?

00:12:17.383 --> 00:12:20.219
He only realized the side effects

00:12:20.302 --> 00:12:21.929
after they died.

00:12:22.846 --> 00:12:24.139
He didn't intend to kill them.

00:12:26.684 --> 00:12:28.769
Even if that's true for Yanagi,

00:12:29.728 --> 00:12:30.771
what about you guys?

00:12:32.439 --> 00:12:34.942
He knew you could die
and still made you take them.

00:12:36.569 --> 00:12:38.070
Why defend him?

00:12:40.698 --> 00:12:42.491
Because now I understand

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:45.327
what "saving the world" means.

00:12:48.539 --> 00:12:50.791
Anyway, that's how it is.

00:12:55.588 --> 00:12:58.007
This case belonged to Yanagi,

00:12:58.799 --> 00:13:01.885
but Nonamare
came to my company looking for it.

00:13:03.053 --> 00:13:05.306
They didn't check my house,

00:13:05.389 --> 00:13:07.474
but they might show up again.

00:13:07.558 --> 00:13:08.559
Why not throw it away?

00:13:08.642 --> 00:13:12.187
I can't do that.
We haven't solved anything.

00:13:13.022 --> 00:13:14.231
What's this memo?

00:13:14.315 --> 00:13:16.525
Notes left by the dead Espers.

00:13:17.568 --> 00:13:20.070
Passwords for the CEO's office and such.

00:13:20.154 --> 00:13:21.488
Why would they have that?

00:13:21.572 --> 00:13:25.367
Because they prepared the office
and computers as part of their missions.

00:13:29.788 --> 00:13:33.959
Maybe I should sneak in
when Kizashi goes out.

00:13:34.585 --> 00:13:36.545
Even if he goes out,

00:13:36.629 --> 00:13:39.173
he's a hologram after all.

00:13:39.256 --> 00:13:41.175
He's invincible, huh?

00:13:41.258 --> 00:13:43.594
He has no physical form,
so none of our powers work on him.

00:13:54.063 --> 00:13:56.857
Hey, Bunty. How about this?

00:14:04.615 --> 00:14:06.158
They won't find it in here.

00:14:06.992 --> 00:14:08.661
Hidden in plain sight.

00:14:15.167 --> 00:14:16.835
Hey, Bunty.

00:14:18.671 --> 00:14:20.172
Should we move?

00:14:24.051 --> 00:14:25.719
I like this place,

00:14:26.637 --> 00:14:28.180
but I don't want to stay here anymore.

00:14:31.725 --> 00:14:32.810
Is that bad?

00:14:34.979 --> 00:14:36.814
No. Let's do it.

00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:39.441
What kind of place do you want?

00:14:41.485 --> 00:14:45.114
Big windows and a big living room
where everyone can come over.

00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:48.659
Let's go to a realtor on my next day off.

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:54.206
There's somewhere I want to take you
on your next day off.

00:14:55.749 --> 00:14:56.709
Where?

00:14:58.585 --> 00:14:59.503
Enoshima.

00:15:02.089 --> 00:15:03.590
You always wanted to go, right?

00:15:04.174 --> 00:15:06.969
You planned out the route from Kamakura

00:15:07.052 --> 00:15:09.972
and chose where to visit and where to eat.

00:15:10.597 --> 00:15:13.559
You made a schedule of the places

00:15:14.184 --> 00:15:15.644
you wanted to re-visit again.

00:15:18.814 --> 00:15:20.065
That was…

00:15:24.361 --> 00:15:25.404
That was?

00:15:27.865 --> 00:15:29.199
A mistake.

00:15:30.325 --> 00:15:33.454
It was a memory from the future.

00:15:34.329 --> 00:15:36.248
It wasn't my memory with you.

00:15:37.207 --> 00:15:39.752
So, I don't want to go there anymore.

00:15:42.921 --> 00:15:44.089
Let's go.

00:15:44.965 --> 00:15:45.841
Let's go

00:15:46.925 --> 00:15:48.719
and overwrite those memories.

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:00.773
KOBAYASHI LAUNDRY

00:16:04.693 --> 00:16:07.196
-This is Jojuji Temple.
-Jojuji, huh?

00:16:07.738 --> 00:16:10.365
What a nice temple.

00:16:24.713 --> 00:16:26.590
-Look, squirrels.
-There are squirrels.

00:16:27.591 --> 00:16:31.178
TEMPLE

00:16:53.951 --> 00:16:55.202
It made me really happy.

00:16:57.121 --> 00:17:00.165
When you said,
"Let's overwrite the memories."

00:17:02.417 --> 00:17:04.545
It's weird, huh?

00:17:04.628 --> 00:17:07.214
Being swayed by memories of the future…

00:17:08.382 --> 00:17:11.135
Exactly. Let's paint over them
in one swoosh.

00:17:11.927 --> 00:17:13.637
-In one swoosh?
-Yeah.

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:14.888
In one swoosh!

00:17:14.972 --> 00:17:16.181
In one swoosh, right?

00:17:21.353 --> 00:17:22.771
Oh…

00:17:25.274 --> 00:17:27.109
-Sorry. One moment.
-Yes.

00:17:29.862 --> 00:17:31.071
It's cute, huh?

00:17:33.031 --> 00:17:34.783
2025 NEW WHITEBAIT RICE BOWL KEYCHAIN

00:17:39.621 --> 00:17:41.248
Enjoy your meal.

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:43.834
Looks so good.

00:17:43.917 --> 00:17:46.962
So many tiny lives…

00:17:47.045 --> 00:17:49.923
Let's dig in and eat them all.

00:17:50.007 --> 00:17:51.675
Brutal.

00:17:55.554 --> 00:17:58.265
-Fresh. Really good.
-So good.

00:18:12.196 --> 00:18:15.199
‎You came all the way here,
‎so you should get whitebait.

00:18:15.282 --> 00:18:18.785
-Whoa, they're transparent.
-Want some?

00:18:20.037 --> 00:18:21.205
Here you go.

00:18:21.288 --> 00:18:22.247
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:27.961
2026 POPULAR WHITEBAIT RICE BOWL KEYCHAIN

00:18:28.045 --> 00:18:29.129
Cute.

00:18:29.213 --> 00:18:30.881
Want to get matching ones?

00:18:39.473 --> 00:18:40.974
-So cute.
-Yeah.

00:18:41.475 --> 00:18:42.809
-How is it?
-How is it?

00:19:07.292 --> 00:19:09.169
The place has a nice vibe,

00:19:09.253 --> 00:19:11.838
but it's too big to use.

00:19:11.922 --> 00:19:13.840
Unless we were opening a shop…

00:19:15.676 --> 00:19:18.804
It's perfect! I really love it here.

00:19:20.847 --> 00:19:22.474
We could watch the moon in autumn.

00:19:27.396 --> 00:19:29.022
-Here, Bunty.
-Yes.

00:19:29.106 --> 00:19:30.524
-Here.
-Thanks.

00:19:30.607 --> 00:19:31.608
Okay.

00:19:32.359 --> 00:19:33.819
-Let's eat.
-Let's eat.

00:19:39.658 --> 00:19:42.286
-Oh!
-Oh no!

00:19:42.369 --> 00:19:44.246
-I think it likes me!
-What?

00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:51.336
I've never made takoyaki
without octopus before.

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:52.838
The look of octopus is just too much.

00:19:52.921 --> 00:19:55.674
Hey, is it still takoyaki without octopus?

00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:57.968
An identity crisis.

00:19:58.051 --> 00:20:00.721
-This is no-identity takoyaki.
-Big Bang.

00:20:01.722 --> 00:20:04.266
The expanding universe
eventually collapses.

00:20:05.642 --> 00:20:07.436
-Boom.
-Boom.

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:09.730
It's hot!

00:20:12.816 --> 00:20:13.900
Bunty, look.

00:20:13.984 --> 00:20:17.279
My dad sent me this. Isn't it awful?

00:20:19.114 --> 00:20:21.491
Does that mean we end at 25 years?

00:20:33.712 --> 00:20:36.173
‎-So cute.
‎-So cute.

00:20:45.849 --> 00:20:48.935
Forty-six, 47,

00:20:49.853 --> 00:20:51.563
48,

00:20:52.272 --> 00:20:53.190
49,

00:20:54.524 --> 00:20:55.609
50.

00:20:56.401 --> 00:20:59.196
-Okay?
-It's really nice.

00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:05.118
After 51 years,

00:21:05.202 --> 00:21:07.245
it depends on our stamina and health.

00:21:07.954 --> 00:21:09.706
How long can we live?

00:21:12.417 --> 00:21:13.752
Not confident.

00:21:16.254 --> 00:21:18.256
I feel like I can.

00:21:19.341 --> 00:21:22.344
With you, Bunty, I could go on forever.

00:21:23.261 --> 00:21:24.137
Eternity.

00:21:24.221 --> 00:21:25.514
Always.

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:28.100
Then,

00:21:28.183 --> 00:21:30.394
let's aim for eternity.

00:21:31.686 --> 00:21:32.854
Aim for it?

00:21:33.438 --> 00:21:34.815
A fleeting kiss.

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:46.201
No.

00:22:14.938 --> 00:22:18.150
-Go! Bunty, go!
-You go, Shiki!

00:22:46.136 --> 00:22:47.387
Drink this.

00:22:49.181 --> 00:22:52.601
If you drink it, you'll lose
these six months of memories.

00:22:54.728 --> 00:22:56.980
You can start over completely clean.

00:22:59.941 --> 00:23:01.568
Is that his order?

00:23:03.945 --> 00:23:05.739
It's my mission for today.

00:23:08.283 --> 00:23:09.326
Seriously?

00:23:11.578 --> 00:23:12.621
Yes.

00:23:15.999 --> 00:23:19.628
I chose you, you know?

00:23:24.216 --> 00:23:25.508
Shiki-san…

00:23:27.636 --> 00:23:29.304
don't lie.

00:23:30.931 --> 00:23:33.099
Your heart's easy to read,

00:23:34.643 --> 00:23:36.478
even without touching it.

00:23:40.774 --> 00:23:42.859
-Shiki-san…
-Stop calling me Shiki-san!

00:23:43.568 --> 00:23:44.945
You also…

00:23:48.198 --> 00:23:49.532
You also…

00:23:50.617 --> 00:23:51.826
stopped calling me

00:23:53.245 --> 00:23:55.121
Bunty from earlier today.

00:24:05.757 --> 00:24:07.592
Your Bunty…

00:24:09.886 --> 00:24:10.929
isn't me.

00:24:13.473 --> 00:24:15.684
Bunty!

00:24:16.893 --> 00:24:20.480
Bunty!

00:24:21.439 --> 00:24:23.191
I'm right here.

00:24:45.338 --> 00:24:49.134
Just as I must rewrite the past,

00:24:49.759 --> 00:24:53.013
you must complete this mission.

00:24:57.475 --> 00:24:58.685
There's a sight

00:24:59.269 --> 00:25:01.229
I cannot forget.

00:25:02.689 --> 00:25:03.940
A moment burned into me forever.

00:25:20.915 --> 00:25:22.334
Bunty?

00:25:28.423 --> 00:25:29.883
I'm glad…

00:25:30.759 --> 00:25:32.135
you're alive.

00:25:40.185 --> 00:25:41.227
Shiki…

00:25:43.813 --> 00:25:45.148
What happened?

00:26:03.792 --> 00:26:05.001
Shiki?

00:26:06.795 --> 00:26:09.172
Shiki!

00:26:26.314 --> 00:26:27.190
Shiki?

00:26:31.486 --> 00:26:32.654
Shiki!

00:26:42.831 --> 00:26:43.957
After that…

00:26:46.292 --> 00:26:48.128
the memory never fades.

00:26:50.463 --> 00:26:52.632
It is burned into me and never goes away.

00:26:54.592 --> 00:26:55.677
Shiki's…

00:26:57.512 --> 00:26:59.180
final form…

00:27:02.267 --> 00:27:04.602
When I learned I could access the past,

00:27:05.728 --> 00:27:07.105
I felt salvation.

00:27:08.898 --> 00:27:10.650
For 20 years,

00:27:12.318 --> 00:27:13.862
I was empty…

00:27:15.447 --> 00:27:16.990
barely breathing.

00:27:18.867 --> 00:27:22.203
If I could rewrite that moment,

00:27:23.037 --> 00:27:24.664
that instant…

00:27:26.624 --> 00:27:27.667
If I could…

00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:30.503
bring Shiki back…

00:27:32.172 --> 00:27:35.300
First, I reached out to an investor.

00:27:36.634 --> 00:27:39.596
I gave him a little information
about the future

00:27:39.679 --> 00:27:41.097
and let him build wealth.

00:27:42.974 --> 00:27:45.143
With that money,

00:27:45.226 --> 00:27:48.605
I hired engineers and researchers.

00:27:49.272 --> 00:27:51.649
I had them create things
this era did not have.

00:27:53.193 --> 00:27:54.986
The Holo Link Communicator,

00:27:55.778 --> 00:27:57.280
the Nano Receptor,

00:27:57.989 --> 00:27:59.532
and the E-Capsules.

00:28:00.742 --> 00:28:04.370
E-Capsules
are perfect for controlling people.

00:28:05.246 --> 00:28:08.082
People are drawn to unknown power.

00:28:09.167 --> 00:28:11.336
Once they have power, they will use it.

00:28:12.462 --> 00:28:14.631
They take the chance
when they begin to believe

00:28:14.714 --> 00:28:16.508
they are saving the world.

00:28:17.091 --> 00:28:18.384
That's fine.

00:28:18.468 --> 00:28:20.303
Mission after mission,

00:28:20.386 --> 00:28:22.222
the world changes.

00:28:22.805 --> 00:28:25.391
Change it into the correct shape.

00:28:25.975 --> 00:28:28.436
The world didn't save Shiki.

00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:31.606
So, I will.

00:28:32.357 --> 00:28:34.067
I will save Shiki's world.

00:28:34.150 --> 00:28:35.902
And save my world.

00:28:36.528 --> 00:28:38.571
Even if 10,000 people die,

00:28:38.655 --> 00:28:41.533
even if a million die,
even if ten million die,

00:28:44.661 --> 00:28:46.496
so what?

00:28:48.289 --> 00:28:51.626
But the world won't change so easily.

00:28:52.502 --> 00:28:53.962
A resistance to interference

00:28:54.045 --> 00:28:56.464
from the future appeared.

00:28:56.548 --> 00:28:58.299
As if the world itself were pushing back.

00:28:59.467 --> 00:29:01.135
I wonder if I'll make it in time.

00:29:04.472 --> 00:29:07.600
As a safety measure, I decided to attempt

00:29:08.601 --> 00:29:11.020
memory installation, as my last resort.

00:29:12.605 --> 00:29:16.401
I'll use Shiki's stored brain data

00:29:17.402 --> 00:29:19.237
and install her future memories

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:22.740
into Shiki of 2025.

00:29:23.533 --> 00:29:26.452
I'll plant a trigger inside her.

00:29:27.245 --> 00:29:30.915
To put her far away
from that horrific end.

00:29:31.833 --> 00:29:35.420
So she won't choose the junction

00:29:36.462 --> 00:29:37.881
that leads to that horrific end.

00:29:41.801 --> 00:29:44.846
Like an angel putting its hand

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:47.098
on her shoulder.

00:29:48.391 --> 00:29:50.602
When the moment comes,

00:29:50.685 --> 00:29:52.937
it will whisper to her, "Not that way."

00:29:53.688 --> 00:29:55.064
That system…

00:29:56.482 --> 00:29:58.443
is the trigger inside her memory.

00:30:02.238 --> 00:30:03.156
Give this…

00:30:05.491 --> 00:30:07.118
to Shiki.

00:30:12.582 --> 00:30:14.083
I know…

00:30:16.794 --> 00:30:18.338
you will for sure…

00:30:20.381 --> 00:30:22.050
carry out the mission.

00:30:26.721 --> 00:30:27.722
Because…

00:30:29.807 --> 00:30:31.434
you love Shiki too.

00:30:43.029 --> 00:30:44.280
I'll leave here.

00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:56.584
When you enter the house, drink this.

00:30:57.502 --> 00:30:59.963
It will begin reinstalling your memories.

00:31:05.051 --> 00:31:06.260
I don't want to drink it.

00:31:08.930 --> 00:31:11.182
Don't be selfish.

00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:14.852
How long do I have to look after you?

00:31:16.688 --> 00:31:18.690
Work or not,

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:21.442
it's a burden.

00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:24.112
You're a burden.

00:31:26.364 --> 00:31:27.490
You are too much.

00:31:29.659 --> 00:31:30.952
You were too high-maintenance.

00:31:32.996 --> 00:31:36.332
This mission was too much for me too.

00:31:41.504 --> 00:31:42.839
Thank you for everything.

00:31:50.513 --> 00:31:52.265
Everything will disappear.

00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:58.187
I'll forget you.

00:32:01.441 --> 00:32:04.694
I love you.

00:32:06.696 --> 00:32:09.115
And you love me, don't you?

00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:20.752
I can't hear your thoughts anymore.

00:32:21.961 --> 00:32:23.713
I stopped taking the medicine.

00:32:26.382 --> 00:32:27.550
Goodbye.

00:32:45.526 --> 00:32:47.153
Shiki and Kizashi,

00:32:49.155 --> 00:32:51.657
stop deciding how I should feel.

00:32:55.953 --> 00:32:57.872
No one loves anyone…

00:33:15.056 --> 00:33:16.432
Mission complete!

00:33:46.170 --> 00:33:47.547
What are you talking about?

00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:50.550
I'm not dying.

00:33:52.969 --> 00:33:55.346
I promised I wouldn't leave you.

00:33:58.015 --> 00:34:01.144
Everyone? Everyone won't die either.

00:34:06.357 --> 00:34:09.443
A text! Look, she's doing fine!

00:34:10.194 --> 00:34:11.946
ENJAKU

00:34:13.281 --> 00:34:15.825
I'LL SEND THE COMMEMORATIVE PHOTO

00:34:22.748 --> 00:34:23.708
What?

00:34:23.791 --> 00:34:26.210
Mrs. Enjaku,
you're not at an internet café?

00:34:28.796 --> 00:34:30.840
It all felt like a dream, huh?

00:34:31.716 --> 00:34:33.009
What?

00:34:33.092 --> 00:34:35.970
I thought I wanted to die
as soon as possible.

00:34:37.013 --> 00:34:39.849
But somewhere along the way,
I started thinking

00:34:39.932 --> 00:34:42.018
maybe the world needs me.

00:34:44.103 --> 00:34:45.938
Heroes are a sweet dream.

00:34:48.024 --> 00:34:49.609
But all lies.

00:34:51.652 --> 00:34:54.655
In the end, it's poison
that eats away your body.

00:35:00.161 --> 00:35:01.329
I thought about it

00:35:02.455 --> 00:35:04.165
every day in prison.

00:35:07.293 --> 00:35:09.712
The man who ruined my life…

00:35:09.795 --> 00:35:11.672
YUKI

00:35:11.756 --> 00:35:13.382
I want to shove his head

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:16.552
into a microwave

00:35:16.636 --> 00:35:18.262
and press start!

00:35:20.723 --> 00:35:21.557
TODAY'S MISSION
MISSION 161

00:35:21.641 --> 00:35:24.727
BRING ICIHMATSU

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:35.738
Ichimatsu.

00:35:37.573 --> 00:35:40.993
What? Hey!

00:35:50.962 --> 00:35:52.171
Somebody!

00:35:54.590 --> 00:35:55.841
Somebody help!

00:35:57.718 --> 00:35:58.761
Somebody help!

00:36:03.307 --> 00:36:06.894
Nice to meet you.
Dr. Ichimatsu, in your younger days.

00:36:09.272 --> 00:36:10.982
You are Kizashi?

00:36:11.565 --> 00:36:12.483
Yes.

00:36:17.738 --> 00:36:20.366
Why do you guys interfere?

00:36:21.867 --> 00:36:23.703
Because you stole the recipe,

00:36:24.787 --> 00:36:26.956
my future self almost gets killed!

00:36:45.641 --> 00:36:47.268
I want to make a deal with you.

00:36:49.478 --> 00:36:51.147
In 2055,

00:36:53.065 --> 00:36:54.483
I will turn myself in.

00:36:55.735 --> 00:36:58.946
If I do that, your death sentence is gone.

00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:00.948
You walk free.

00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:05.161
What is the catch?

00:37:05.244 --> 00:37:06.996
You back off now.

00:37:07.705 --> 00:37:11.208
No more interference.
Do not get in my way.

00:37:22.553 --> 00:37:24.388
Because of your interference,

00:37:24.472 --> 00:37:26.515
my schedule is slipping.

00:37:27.725 --> 00:37:30.561
-Schedule?
-Change the world.

00:37:32.188 --> 00:37:33.522
My plan.

00:37:36.108 --> 00:37:37.985
Why do you want to kill

00:37:38.069 --> 00:37:39.945
ten million people?

00:37:41.155 --> 00:37:42.823
I do not want to kill them.

00:37:43.783 --> 00:37:46.994
But if the world is set into
the correct shape, that is what happens.

00:37:47.078 --> 00:37:48.788
Correct shape?

00:37:48.871 --> 00:37:52.041
There is someone I want to save.

00:37:54.168 --> 00:37:55.920
That person died?

00:37:56.003 --> 00:37:59.131
Yes. Ten years from now.

00:38:02.593 --> 00:38:06.055
If I could die in her place
and save her, I would.

00:38:06.138 --> 00:38:09.850
If I die, she ends up
living an unhappy life.

00:38:12.561 --> 00:38:14.230
That is what the simulations showed.

00:38:15.147 --> 00:38:16.982
Even after trying a trillion ways,

00:38:17.066 --> 00:38:18.901
even ten quadrillion ways, it failed.

00:38:18.984 --> 00:38:22.780
Even so, you cannot let ten million
people die who were not meant to die.

00:38:22.863 --> 00:38:25.324
Is the problem
that the number is too large?

00:38:25.408 --> 00:38:26.617
The fewer, the better?

00:38:27.785 --> 00:38:32.206
You think it's wrong for a nation to fall,
but fine if a small country disappears?

00:38:32.289 --> 00:38:34.583
Even one person
in a small country has a life.

00:38:35.126 --> 00:38:36.460
That is a cheap argument

00:38:37.086 --> 00:38:39.964
from someone
trying to erase ten million lives.

00:38:41.966 --> 00:38:44.093
You say you will turn yourself in,

00:38:44.176 --> 00:38:45.636
but if you succeed in rewriting the past,

00:38:45.719 --> 00:38:47.346
the current you will vanish, right?

00:38:49.265 --> 00:38:51.684
And if she lives in the future,

00:38:52.768 --> 00:38:54.437
you are never born, right?

00:38:57.648 --> 00:38:59.233
As expected of you, Dr. Ichimatsu.

00:38:59.316 --> 00:39:01.444
So, you never planned to turn yourself in!

00:39:01.527 --> 00:39:04.738
Think one step further.

00:39:05.322 --> 00:39:07.533
If the world is corrected,

00:39:07.616 --> 00:39:11.328
the version of me who tries
to rewrite the past is never born.

00:39:11.412 --> 00:39:14.498
That means the future
where the E-Capsule recipe is stolen

00:39:14.582 --> 00:39:17.543
also disappears,
and you guys are never framed.

00:39:17.626 --> 00:39:19.128
Everything is resolved.

00:39:19.712 --> 00:39:21.130
-Resolved?
-Yes.

00:39:22.756 --> 00:39:23.591
What about me?

00:39:25.301 --> 00:39:29.013
Even if the future changes,
the me here right now does not change.

00:39:29.972 --> 00:39:31.765
-So?
-I'm…

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:36.228
Then I am stuck believing ten million
people died because I failed to stop you!

00:39:38.731 --> 00:39:40.524
You are thinking too seriously.

00:39:40.608 --> 00:39:43.486
-Try to be more relaxed.
-I am not that kind of person!

00:39:44.111 --> 00:39:46.113
I obsess and regret forever,

00:39:46.197 --> 00:39:48.199
and my hands sweat nonstop every time!

00:39:49.658 --> 00:39:51.702
If ten million die,

00:39:51.785 --> 00:39:53.454
I will be drenched for life!

00:39:56.624 --> 00:39:58.375
I cannot accept your deal.

00:40:01.253 --> 00:40:03.464
I cannot say ten million deaths are okay.

00:40:04.715 --> 00:40:06.008
I cannot say that.

00:40:10.471 --> 00:40:11.847
You're foolish.

00:40:15.059 --> 00:40:17.102
Go ahead

00:40:18.187 --> 00:40:19.813
and regret that choice again.

00:40:27.738 --> 00:40:29.073
What should I do with this?

00:40:30.574 --> 00:40:31.617
Hey!

00:40:53.180 --> 00:40:54.807
Thanks.

00:40:55.391 --> 00:40:57.017
Why are you here?

00:41:00.437 --> 00:41:01.355
Sorry.

00:41:22.793 --> 00:41:25.629
Shiki. What happened?

00:41:28.882 --> 00:41:31.176
It's burning. It hurts.

00:41:32.177 --> 00:41:33.804
My stomach is burning.

00:41:34.471 --> 00:41:36.682
Hot. It hurts.

00:41:38.684 --> 00:41:39.893
No way.

00:41:42.021 --> 00:41:43.314
I cannot feel anything.

00:41:48.444 --> 00:41:49.778
Shiki!

00:41:50.404 --> 00:41:51.488
Shiki!

00:41:52.406 --> 00:41:53.449
Shiki!

00:41:54.325 --> 00:41:55.701
I want to go home.

00:42:02.249 --> 00:42:03.375
Right.

00:42:05.085 --> 00:42:06.337
I died.

00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:11.383
I am going to die…

00:42:32.821 --> 00:42:34.073
Not so high.

00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:39.953
With inertia, will it work?

00:43:40.305 --> 00:43:41.390
What's going on?

00:44:15.007 --> 00:44:17.050
‎Bunty and Bunty.

00:44:17.134 --> 00:44:19.386
‎I'll kill them both.

00:44:19.470 --> 00:44:22.389
‎To die is as hard as to be able to do it.

00:44:22.473 --> 00:44:25.809
‎Alright, should we save the day?

00:44:25.893 --> 00:44:27.102
‎Just a bit hero, okay?

00:44:27.186 --> 00:44:28.020
‎THIS DRAMA IS FICTION
