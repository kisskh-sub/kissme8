(Ren Jiatong 1, Jiang Chen 1)

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.281
I didn't edit the presentation.
Ms. Bai did it.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:59.320
Ms. Bai?

00:02:01.841 --> 00:02:03.080
When you sent it to me,

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.841
I was asleep.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.001
I sent it at 3 AM.

00:02:07.561 --> 00:02:08.841
We must be here by 7 AM.

00:02:09.521 --> 00:02:10.561
Didn't Ms. Bai sleep?

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.760
She must be exhausted.
She spent all day in court.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.336
Now, she has to handle the family.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.760
But Ms. Bai didn't scold me once today.

00:02:21.841 --> 00:02:23.121
She appreciated my hard work.

00:02:23.841 --> 00:02:25.720
Doesn't it feel worse
if she doesn't scold you?

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.480
It means she is teaching you.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.961
You'll remember this moment.

00:02:32.283 --> 00:02:32.961
(Serving the People with Fair Justice)

00:02:32.961 --> 00:02:34.361
Many people say she's strict.

00:02:35.001 --> 00:02:37.081
Actually, she just takes work seriously,

00:02:37.561 --> 00:02:38.361
not against anyone.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.801
Work is the most important thing to her.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.160
No matter how tired,
she never slacks off.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.521
If I'd been more diligent,

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.480
Ms. Bai could get two hours of sleep.

00:02:49.681 --> 00:02:50.561
Stop feeling guilty.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.290
You're a newcomer.
It's normal to be inexperienced.

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.801
If anyone's to blame, it should be me.
I should have edited it.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.360
Ms. Bai's child had a fever last night.

00:03:00.801 --> 00:03:01.561
Remember when she

00:03:01.561 --> 00:03:02.801
took a long call last night?

00:03:03.521 --> 00:03:07.040
It was from the nanny.
She must've been worried.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.584
And she stayed up late working.

00:03:19.516 --> 00:03:20.936

Yan Fei.

00:03:39.801 --> 00:03:41.401
Are you working overtime?

00:03:42.961 --> 00:03:44.561
Any problem with me working overtime?

00:03:46.121 --> 00:03:48.320
I've never seen you
at the firm this late.

00:03:49.801 --> 00:03:51.200
Am I really that lazy?

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.160
Why are you here at this hour?

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.841
Working overtime for Mr. Song?

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.640
When is your project wrapping up?

00:03:59.121 --> 00:04:00.440
I'm just wrapping things up now.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.920
I'll rejoin Ms. Bai's team next week.
How about you?

00:04:03.081 --> 00:04:03.600
Any plans?

00:04:05.281 --> 00:04:05.896
Me?

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.841
I used to oppose my brother.

00:04:12.241 --> 00:04:13.681
He assigned me to Mr. Zhuang's team.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.681
I wanted to join Mr. Song's team.

00:04:16.121 --> 00:04:17.601
But he suddenly changed his attitude.

00:04:17.601 --> 00:04:18.801
No clue what got into him.

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.064
He supports me in joining
Mr. Song's team.

00:04:21.721 --> 00:04:23.921
But I'm also interested

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.200
in Ms. Bai's case.

00:04:26.041 --> 00:04:28.280
Someone is tutoring you. Who's so nice?

00:04:31.001 --> 00:04:31.560
Look.

00:04:32.161 --> 00:04:32.760
Shooting stars.

00:04:34.721 --> 00:04:36.161
Miss Yan,

00:04:36.161 --> 00:04:38.320
your skills of changing
the topic are terrible.

00:04:40.801 --> 00:04:42.601
I knew you are working overtime

00:04:42.601 --> 00:04:44.960
for the sake of someone.

00:04:45.241 --> 00:04:45.801
Let's talk.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:47.624
Sure.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.840
Let's talk.

00:04:49.681 --> 00:04:51.041
We can talk

00:04:51.121 --> 00:04:53.561
about Ren Jiatong
getting a cold last time.

00:04:55.161 --> 00:04:56.921
Oh, it's a meteor shower.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.320
So many shooting stars.

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.241
Isn't Mr. Song looking for you?

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.640
He had important things to do and left.

00:05:13.721 --> 00:05:15.041
I'm with Niuniu at the hospital.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:15.921
Don't worry.

00:05:16.681 --> 00:05:17.561
Thank you for this.

00:05:17.561 --> 00:05:19.161
The nanny sprained her ankle.

00:05:19.944 --> 00:05:20.601
I...

00:05:20.601 --> 00:05:22.320
Don't mention it.

00:05:23.241 --> 00:05:25.400
I'm happy that you
thought of me first when you

00:05:25.801 --> 00:05:26.561
needed help.

00:05:28.121 --> 00:05:28.776
Alright.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.041
I'll treat you to dinner when I'm back.

00:05:31.336 --> 00:05:31.921
Okay.

00:05:32.241 --> 00:05:32.880
I'm hanging up.

00:05:33.241 --> 00:05:35.001
I'm with Niuniu. Focus on your work.

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.200
Come back early.

00:05:43.481 --> 00:05:44.040
Ms. Bai.

00:05:44.801 --> 00:05:46.152
It's cold. Don't catch a chill.

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.200
Mr. Song specifically asked me

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.481
to bring you a scarf
since your neck is bothering you.

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:51.912
Okay.

00:05:52.681 --> 00:05:53.384
Thank you.

00:05:54.481 --> 00:05:55.176
Ms. Bai.

00:05:56.361 --> 00:05:57.361
I apologize to you.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:59.481
For what?

00:06:02.241 --> 00:06:02.960
Rest assured,

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:04.921
I'll stay up all night if needed.

00:06:04.921 --> 00:06:06.640
What happened last night
won't happen again.

00:06:11.721 --> 00:06:13.241
You haven't fully recovered yet.

00:06:13.241 --> 00:06:14.200
Don't stay up late.

00:06:15.161 --> 00:06:16.840
Health is part of your competitive edge.

00:06:18.001 --> 00:06:18.640
Moreover,

00:06:18.801 --> 00:06:20.640
if your mother knows you're sick,

00:06:21.161 --> 00:06:22.001
she will worry.

00:06:22.001 --> 00:06:23.041
Unable to help at all,

00:06:23.241 --> 00:06:24.320
she'd feel even worse.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.161
Thank you, Ms. Bai.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:31.721
Don't worry.

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.481
Niuniu will definitely recover soon.

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.280
This time,

00:06:37.801 --> 00:06:38.801
we're sure to win.

00:06:41.851 --> 00:06:44.584
(Jiang Chen: Voice message)

00:06:44.668 --> 00:06:46.632
(Jiang Chen: Two voice messages)

00:07:00.481 --> 00:07:02.280
When a person always delays

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.760
in replying to you, does it mean
this person doesn't like you?

00:07:05.121 --> 00:07:05.640
Not really.

00:07:06.241 --> 00:07:07.280
Maybe he did reply,

00:07:07.681 --> 00:07:09.121
but his phone swallowed it.

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:13.840
Something is going on?

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:16.840
Let me help you analyze this.

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.001
Which guy is it?

00:07:19.561 --> 00:07:20.681
I actually asked him

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.200
if he likes me.

00:07:22.601 --> 00:07:23.280
What did he say?

00:07:24.601 --> 00:07:26.481
He said he does like me,

00:07:27.001 --> 00:07:27.880
but it's the kind

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.880
of care and affection
toward a younger sibling.

00:07:31.361 --> 00:07:32.840
Not romantic feelings at all.

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.320
He had a girlfriend before,

00:07:35.921 --> 00:07:37.601
and she must be quite different from me.

00:07:38.161 --> 00:07:38.960
She is really nice

00:07:39.001 --> 00:07:40.161
and quite good-looking.

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:41.768
They had been together for years.

00:07:41.921 --> 00:07:43.840
Though they're broken up now...

00:07:45.721 --> 00:07:46.801
What am I even saying?

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.681
Anyway, I regret it now.

00:07:49.681 --> 00:07:50.520
I shouldn't ask him.

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:51.161
You like him.

00:07:52.241 --> 00:07:53.601
I don't know whether he likes you.

00:07:53.721 --> 00:07:54.840
But you definitely like him.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:56.520
Impossible.

00:07:57.801 --> 00:07:59.601
Answering so quickly is suspicious.

00:07:59.921 --> 00:08:01.481
I wouldn't fall for a lawyer.

00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:02.681
A male lawyer.

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:06.161
Miss Yan.

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.041
Anyway, it's someone I shouldn't like.

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:10.681
Now I've confessed

00:08:10.681 --> 00:08:11.760
and embarrassed myself.

00:08:12.481 --> 00:08:13.481
Jiang Chen, listen,

00:08:13.481 --> 00:08:14.440
if you spill this,

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:15.561
I'll hit you.

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:17.361
Smile.

00:08:20.001 --> 00:08:21.041
Why? That's so cheesy.

00:08:21.241 --> 00:08:22.361
I'll send you this photo.

00:08:22.681 --> 00:08:23.481
Then,

00:08:23.601 --> 00:08:25.280
you'll post it on Moments later.

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:26.760
Any caption is okay.

00:08:26.801 --> 00:08:28.280
Make sure only he can see it.

00:08:28.561 --> 00:08:29.121
I believe

00:08:29.121 --> 00:08:30.880
that if this guy truly
has feelings for you

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:31.960
or likes you,

00:08:32.241 --> 00:08:33.201
he will respond.

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:35.400
Really?

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:36.441
Of course.

00:08:36.721 --> 00:08:37.680
Like cross-examination.

00:08:38.241 --> 00:08:40.121
What're you thinking?
Have you thought about it?

00:08:40.121 --> 00:08:41.961
If not, what are you dwelling on?

00:08:42.121 --> 00:08:43.121
But if you have,

00:08:43.201 --> 00:08:44.520
delete that post.

00:08:47.721 --> 00:08:48.392
Okay.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:50.216
I'm posting it.

00:09:14.139 --> 00:09:16.456
(Me in his eyes)

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:52.361
The takeout.

00:09:52.841 --> 00:09:53.441
Thanks.

00:10:06.441 --> 00:10:07.080
Got it.

00:10:07.481 --> 00:10:08.040
I see.

00:10:11.321 --> 00:10:12.841
Ms. Bai, how's Niuniu doing?

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:16.424
- Her fever has gone down.
- That's a relief.

00:10:17.361 --> 00:10:18.441
We have a court tomorrow,

00:10:18.441 --> 00:10:20.441
so no one should stay up late tonight.

00:10:20.841 --> 00:10:22.640
Zhou Nian, I reviewed your part.

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:23.520
No issues there.

00:10:23.841 --> 00:10:24.800
Head back and sleep.

00:10:25.241 --> 00:10:27.121
I'll check Ren Jiatong's part later.

00:10:27.721 --> 00:10:28.296
Alright.

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:29.361
Sure.

00:10:29.361 --> 00:10:30.800
Ms. Bai, rest early once you finish.

00:10:34.721 --> 00:10:35.880
Mr. Zhou, aren't you eating?

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:36.808
I won't.

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.664
I'm going back.
I'm tired and I will sleep.

00:10:57.441 --> 00:10:58.001
Ms. Bai,

00:10:58.560 --> 00:10:59.481
this part...

00:10:59.481 --> 00:11:00.361
Take a break.

00:11:00.361 --> 00:11:01.880
Eat something right now.

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:13.448
What's wrong?

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:16.241
Promise you won't get mad.

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.280
These high-calorie snacks

00:11:21.441 --> 00:11:22.680
don't really fit your persona.

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:25.400
What persona?

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:31.361
The elite professional woman

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:34.121
who often has light salads
and healthy meals every single day.

00:11:34.321 --> 00:11:35.752
Low in fat, filling, and healthy.

00:11:36.001 --> 00:11:37.800
You've watched many short videos

00:11:37.961 --> 00:11:39.321
with outdated stereotypes.

00:11:39.481 --> 00:11:41.040
Career women are also emotional.

00:11:41.321 --> 00:11:42.160
Under great pressure,

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.361
I crave spicy, sweet,
and high-calorie food.

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:45.520
It helps lift my mood.

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:46.201
That makes sense.

00:11:46.721 --> 00:11:48.280
It's never too late for regrets.

00:11:49.481 --> 00:11:50.160
But if you

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:51.680
insist on labeling me,

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.680
it would be like this.

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.121
I take immense pride in my career.

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:56.721
But I'm not a good mother.

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.400
Niuniu will understand
when she grows up.

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:02.361
You have no choice.

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:04.961
But I still feel guilty.

00:12:06.201 --> 00:12:07.121
I love my child deeply.

00:12:07.121 --> 00:12:08.361
Yet I also love my work.

00:12:09.001 --> 00:12:09.721
What can I do?

00:12:09.721 --> 00:12:10.800
24 hours in a day.

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:11.441
So I split it,

00:12:12.001 --> 00:12:13.721
half for work, and half for my child.

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:16.760
But the half for my child
is not sufficient.

00:12:17.441 --> 00:12:18.560
Actually, I have no choice.

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:21.040
Realistically speaking,

00:12:21.961 --> 00:12:23.160
as a single mom,

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:25.121
I have to

00:12:25.201 --> 00:12:26.280
handle things alone

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:27.280
and support my family.

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:29.520
Personally,

00:12:30.201 --> 00:12:32.680
I feel I can fulfill
my potential and feel a sense

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:33.841
of accomplishment at work.

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:35.640
It truly lights me up.

00:12:36.481 --> 00:12:37.321
Mothers

00:12:37.321 --> 00:12:39.160
always worry about their kids.

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:42.201
Every time I leave Niuniu for work,

00:12:43.081 --> 00:12:45.040
I'll wrestle with overwhelming guilt

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:47.280
for a long time.

00:12:49.601 --> 00:12:50.280
Ms. Bai.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:51.760
You're already doing great.

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:55.680
It's incredibly tough
for women to build careers.

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:58.160
I'm luckier than most.

00:12:58.721 --> 00:12:59.441
I have

00:12:59.441 --> 00:13:00.640
an incredible nanny

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:01.680
who's been very helpful.

00:13:01.961 --> 00:13:02.760
Even so,

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:04.400
it's been a bumpy road.

00:13:06.001 --> 00:13:07.841
Every mother shares the same struggle.

00:13:08.321 --> 00:13:10.361
There's always something to worry about.

00:13:11.321 --> 00:13:13.520
This is my reality, Tian Min's reality,

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:15.400
and I'm sure your mother's too.

00:13:24.841 --> 00:13:26.481
Don't worry. We're here for you.

00:13:27.321 --> 00:13:27.920
Okay?

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:29.601
We have put our hearts into this.

00:13:30.361 --> 00:13:32.001
But why don't we have positive results?

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:36.201
But the first verdict
isn't finalized yet.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:38.560
We can cling to the hope.

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.920
Based on this week's
court proceedings, the hope is slim.

00:13:43.481 --> 00:13:45.241
Ms. Bai wants
to prepare the family mentally

00:13:45.241 --> 00:13:46.280
for that possibility.

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:48.800
This is the reality of our profession.

00:13:50.001 --> 00:13:50.800
You work so hard

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:52.280
and still face disappointment.

00:13:55.001 --> 00:13:56.481
Ms. Bai seems different from usual.

00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:57.961
She often

00:13:58.601 --> 00:14:00.280
compares our role
to doctors in hospitals.

00:14:01.001 --> 00:14:01.760
We give our best,

00:14:02.241 --> 00:14:03.481
but results aren't always good.

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:05.040
However,

00:14:05.721 --> 00:14:07.520
walking clients through the process

00:14:07.841 --> 00:14:10.400
to provide dignity and support

00:14:11.001 --> 00:14:11.640
matters too.

00:14:18.481 --> 00:14:19.361
Thank you, Ms. Bai.

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:30.400
Let's go.

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:32.481
Submit all required documents
once we return,

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:34.800
and start prepping the second appeal.

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:35.560
Okay.

00:15:00.081 --> 00:15:00.744
Come in.

00:15:03.081 --> 00:15:05.520
Mr. Song, did you receive the draft

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:06.481
of my legal opinion?

00:15:07.081 --> 00:15:08.081
Yes, I'm reviewing it.

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:09.128
Come on in.

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:14.481
So, how's my draft?

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:17.760
Perfect timing.

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:20.160
Tell me about your thoughts first.

00:15:21.201 --> 00:15:22.280
Here are my thoughts.

00:15:22.441 --> 00:15:23.481
First, I utilized AI

00:15:23.481 --> 00:15:24.560
with its chat function

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:25.361
to understand

00:15:25.361 --> 00:15:26.680
how AI works.

00:15:27.121 --> 00:15:28.520
Next, I conducted thorough research

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:30.920
on China's regulatory framework,
landmark court rulings,

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:32.601
and extensive international legislation

00:15:32.601 --> 00:15:34.201
and judicial literature on AI.

00:15:34.481 --> 00:15:36.280
Finally,
I drafted the initial legal opinion.

00:15:37.481 --> 00:15:39.601
Then I mainly proposed
the following suggestions.

00:15:40.201 --> 00:15:40.880
First,

00:15:41.081 --> 00:15:43.321
assigning users the rights
to outcomes generated by AI,

00:15:43.321 --> 00:15:44.961
such as pictures,

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:46.361
music, videos,

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:47.680
and other creations.

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:49.560
Yiaiwan does not
claim ownership of these.

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:50.640
Second...

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:53.040
Hold on. The rest
of your opinion is good.

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:55.560
About the first point,
what is your rationale?

00:15:56.001 --> 00:15:58.121
Why advise Yiaiwan to waive its rights?

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:01.361
Mr. Song, indeed, I advise Yiaiwan

00:16:01.361 --> 00:16:03.601
not to assert rights
over user-generated content.

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:05.321
This seems not to benefit our client,

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:07.721
but after thorough market research,

00:16:07.721 --> 00:16:08.961
I reached this conclusion.

00:16:09.201 --> 00:16:09.800
I believe

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:11.640
that if Yiaiwan offers this concession,

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:13.081
after launching their model,

00:16:13.081 --> 00:16:13.760
it will create

00:16:13.841 --> 00:16:15.280
a strong user acquisition advantage.

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:16.560
Commercially speaking,

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:17.961
this benefits Yiaiwan.

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:20.121
This is a business decision,

00:16:20.441 --> 00:16:22.760
so I explicitly stated
in the legal opinion

00:16:23.001 --> 00:16:24.001
that Yiaiwan must

00:16:24.001 --> 00:16:25.560
carefully weigh this

00:16:25.721 --> 00:16:26.560
against their goals.

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:29.280
Honestly,

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:31.241
on this matter,

00:16:31.361 --> 00:16:32.961
our thinking aligns perfectly.

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:36.481
Besides, you included
supporting materials. I'm impressed.

00:16:37.601 --> 00:16:38.361
Really?

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:39.880
Thank you.

00:16:40.121 --> 00:16:41.160
How time flies.

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:42.800
Remember when you

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.400
used to cry and demand to leave?

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:45.760
You are more capable now.

00:16:46.201 --> 00:16:47.081
I was concerned

00:16:47.481 --> 00:16:50.481
your past relationship
might affect your work for Yiaiwan.

00:16:51.361 --> 00:16:53.121
But aren't you the one who taught us

00:16:53.481 --> 00:16:55.361
to leverage every possible advantage?

00:16:56.241 --> 00:16:57.081
As the ex-girlfriend

00:16:57.241 --> 00:16:59.520
of an employee of Yiaiwan,

00:17:00.201 --> 00:17:02.640
I found this task quite difficult.

00:17:02.961 --> 00:17:05.241
But as a trainee of Jun An,

00:17:06.241 --> 00:17:08.001
it becomes my competitive edge

00:17:08.001 --> 00:17:09.320
and my trump card.

00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:12.360
As the former heartthrob of Jun An,

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:15.336
you are still leveraging your good
looks to navigate the legal world.

00:17:15.681 --> 00:17:18.161
So even if I am ex-girlfriend
of an employee of Yiaiwan,

00:17:18.401 --> 00:17:19.800
it's still serviceable!

00:17:20.201 --> 00:17:21.120
Watch your language.

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:22.520
Former heartthrob?

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:23.752
No,

00:17:24.401 --> 00:17:26.681
you're currently the most handsome man!

00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:27.681
Alright.

00:17:27.681 --> 00:17:28.441
- The best!
- Alright.

00:17:30.241 --> 00:17:31.481
Remember, don't mention me

00:17:32.001 --> 00:17:34.001
when you cause troubles.

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:36.961
Mr. Song,

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:38.760
so for this round,

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:42.161
can I get some bonus points?

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:43.912
Sure.

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:45.120
Definitely.

00:17:46.921 --> 00:17:47.641
Thank you.

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:54.600
You're back.

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:56.401
You didn't go home?

00:17:58.120 --> 00:17:59.241
I'm working overtime.

00:18:00.641 --> 00:18:02.320
Xiaoyu and I
will have late-night snacks.

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:03.120
Maybe join us?

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:04.881
I'll pass.

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:10.520
I have documents to organize.
I'll email them to you once done.

00:18:11.241 --> 00:18:12.120
Okay. Thanks.

00:18:20.921 --> 00:18:21.576
Mr. Zhou.

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:26.001
What did you text me the other day?

00:18:26.721 --> 00:18:27.921
You messaged me on WeChat,

00:18:27.921 --> 00:18:29.161
but retracted it immediately.

00:18:29.881 --> 00:18:31.401
I'm really curious about what it is.

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:34.441
It was nothing.

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:36.641
I retracted a misdirected text.

00:18:37.201 --> 00:18:38.681
Then why come straight to the office

00:18:38.681 --> 00:18:39.681
instead of home

00:18:39.921 --> 00:18:41.921
to organize some files
unimportant to you?

00:18:42.881 --> 00:18:43.840
I promised I would.

00:18:45.001 --> 00:18:47.320
Shouldn't I keep my promises?

00:18:47.961 --> 00:18:48.760
I am a lawyer.

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:50.080
You're a lawyer,

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:53.441
but you're not my lawyer.

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:02.840
I am...

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:05.681
I'm your mentor.

00:19:08.401 --> 00:19:09.032
Yan Fei.

00:19:09.881 --> 00:19:11.481
I don't want to feel awkward

00:19:11.481 --> 00:19:12.120
at work.

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:23.240
Okay.

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:26.001
I'm going.

00:20:05.481 --> 00:20:06.056
Xie,

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:07.721
did you see my colleague?

00:20:07.921 --> 00:20:09.192
A pretty girl with long hair.

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:10.401
No, I didn't.

00:20:32.921 --> 00:20:33.641
Did you find her?

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:37.161
She drove off. I forgot.

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:39.840
The one just now?

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:44.840
Why bother yourself?

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:46.600
She drives such a nice car.

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:47.840
Why would she need an umbrella?

00:21:13.241 --> 00:21:15.360
Yan Fei, you asked me out.

00:21:15.961 --> 00:21:17.481
I've waited almost 20 minutes.

00:21:17.481 --> 00:21:18.721
Are you coming or not?

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:22.800
Almost there. Three minutes at most.

00:21:23.201 --> 00:21:23.760
Wait.

00:21:24.001 --> 00:21:24.760
Drive slowly.

00:21:25.161 --> 00:21:26.481
I'll wait another 20 minutes.

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:39.520
Two minutes forty-seven seconds.
Under three minutes.

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:41.480
Are you sure
you didn't break any traffic laws?

00:21:41.721 --> 00:21:42.921
I study law.

00:21:42.921 --> 00:21:44.520
How could I break it?

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:46.721
I drove within speed limits
the whole time.

00:21:46.881 --> 00:21:47.840
I'm a professional.

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:50.560
Just drink. Quit the chatter.

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:54.401
You're acting like those experts

00:21:54.401 --> 00:21:56.201
testing legal boundaries.

00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:57.600
What's going on?

00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:00.320
You're a fitness buff.

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:02.040
Calling me for late-night snacks

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:03.201
is weird enough.

00:22:03.201 --> 00:22:04.001
What happened?

00:22:04.641 --> 00:22:05.224
Come on.

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:09.481
Your relationship counselor is ready.

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:11.120
My shoulder is ready.

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:12.120
Tissues are plentiful.

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:13.481
Beer or liquor? Your choice.

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:14.376
Today,

00:22:14.721 --> 00:22:16.080
I'm all in for you.

00:22:17.881 --> 00:22:18.440
Ridiculous.

00:22:20.481 --> 00:22:22.040
Speeding, drinking,

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:23.681
seeing friends and staying silent

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:25.641
means you broke up.

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:28.600
I've got a designated driver.

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:30.360
Now, we drink.

00:22:30.481 --> 00:22:31.600
No talking. Shut up.

00:22:31.921 --> 00:22:32.441
Deal?

00:22:33.401 --> 00:22:33.992
Deal.

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:36.681
Let me pour for you.

00:22:42.481 --> 00:22:43.320
Don't tell me

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:45.760
you just went all out
confessing to someone?

00:22:45.881 --> 00:22:46.641
I didn't.

00:22:47.241 --> 00:22:48.560
You actually confessed?

00:22:53.161 --> 00:22:54.161
What's done is done.

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:56.760
The embarrassment is real.

00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:57.736
Wait,

00:22:58.641 --> 00:22:59.240
you...

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:00.641
Who even

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:02.560
confesses nowadays?

00:23:03.241 --> 00:23:04.360
Keep it ambiguous

00:23:04.881 --> 00:23:06.001
and use a strategy.

00:23:06.481 --> 00:23:08.681
When he pushes, pull back.
When he retreats, advance.

00:23:08.681 --> 00:23:10.441
You're charging ahead alone,

00:23:10.441 --> 00:23:12.001
so he just keeps retreating.

00:23:13.401 --> 00:23:14.088
Wait,

00:23:14.441 --> 00:23:15.441
but then again,

00:23:16.481 --> 00:23:18.441
why would he retreat
if you're proactive?

00:23:18.441 --> 00:23:19.401
Is he stupid?

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:23.040
I can't tell which of us is more stupid.

00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:27.401
He joined me in boxing workouts.

00:23:27.961 --> 00:23:30.320
We watched the stars
on the Fifth Ring Road at night.

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:32.520
If that doesn't mean affection,

00:23:32.921 --> 00:23:33.681
what does it mean?

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:38.161
Are we even
in the same Talent Hunt Program?

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:40.040
You had time to watch the stars?

00:23:43.201 --> 00:23:43.848
Drink.

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:48.080
Let me process.

00:23:49.241 --> 00:23:50.201
So here's the deal.

00:23:50.641 --> 00:23:52.040
This guy is into you,

00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:53.760
but plays hard to get.

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:56.161
But you like him, being curious
about his real thoughts.

00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:57.288
Right?

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:00.600
There are plenty of guys
like this online.

00:24:01.161 --> 00:24:03.280
For instance, they're
trying to gaslight you.

00:24:03.721 --> 00:24:05.040
They know you're wealthy,

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:06.040
setting a trap for you.

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:07.280
You can't be serious.

00:24:07.481 --> 00:24:09.641
Stop. He's not that kind of guy.

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:11.721
In that case,

00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:13.721
it's simpler.

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:15.800
If he likes you but rejects you,

00:24:16.241 --> 00:24:18.641
there's only one explanation.

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:20.120
There must be a reason

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:21.881
you can't be together.

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:23.161
For example,

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:24.961
family background,

00:24:25.721 --> 00:24:26.881
income differences,

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:28.560
or long-distance issues.

00:24:38.201 --> 00:24:39.241
Never mind the reason.

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:40.840
Anyway, it's in the past.

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:41.928
I'll move on.

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:45.001
From now on, we're just colleagues.

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:48.161
Colleagues?

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:51.120
Don't tell me it's...

00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:58.600
How could he do that?

00:24:59.721 --> 00:25:00.721
What about Jiatong?

00:25:01.881 --> 00:25:03.840
Ren Jiatong? Why hasn't she come?

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:06.441
They should be...

00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:08.120
They're back by now.

00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:09.840
Well,

00:25:11.161 --> 00:25:12.760
don't call her here.

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:14.961
Why not?

00:25:15.201 --> 00:25:16.001
I'll call her now.

00:25:18.161 --> 00:25:18.792
I'll call.

00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:20.104
I'll do it.

00:25:30.881 --> 00:25:31.961
Hello, Jiatong?

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:34.080
Are you back?

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:37.224
Okay.

00:25:37.881 --> 00:25:39.001
Well,

00:25:39.161 --> 00:25:41.120
I'm having dinner out with Yan Fei.

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:43.120
She invited you to join us.

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:46.560
You just got back from a business trip
and must be exhausted.

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:47.760
You couldn't come, right?

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:50.401
I'm fine, not too tired.

00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:51.840
I slept during the flight.

00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:59.880
Xiaoyu, my phone's out of power.
I'll call back later.

00:26:08.441 --> 00:26:08.961
What's wrong?

00:26:10.001 --> 00:26:12.001
I sent you so many messages,
and you never replied.

00:26:14.921 --> 00:26:15.481
Out of power.

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:17.641
How could you block me then?

00:26:18.441 --> 00:26:19.600
I saw you speaking on a call.

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:23.320
Did I do something wrong?
Are you mad at me?

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:27.241
If you need to reach me, call me

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:29.241
or use office software.

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:30.641
Between colleagues,

00:26:30.921 --> 00:26:31.800
that's sufficient.

00:26:51.161 --> 00:26:52.296
Why are you following me?

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:54.721
You didn't respond
to my WeChat messages.

00:26:56.001 --> 00:26:57.161
I asked when you'd arrive,

00:26:57.161 --> 00:26:58.120
and you blocked me.

00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:00.161
I reread our chat history so many times,

00:27:00.161 --> 00:27:01.760
but still couldn't find the problem.

00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:03.840
I tried hard to get close to Mr. Zhou

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:04.520
just to find out

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:06.001
when your flight actually landed.

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:10.080
I didn't pick you up at the airport
as I worried they might misunderstand.

00:27:10.681 --> 00:27:12.441
So I waited outside your home instead.

00:27:12.441 --> 00:27:13.320
But then you just said

00:27:14.961 --> 00:27:16.201
that we're just colleagues

00:27:16.641 --> 00:27:17.441
and dismissed me.

00:27:18.161 --> 00:27:19.520
What exactly do you want?

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:22.800
I'm sick.

00:27:25.201 --> 00:27:25.921
I feel terrible.

00:27:31.961 --> 00:27:33.080
What's wrong with you?

00:27:35.001 --> 00:27:35.840
I have no appetite.

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:37.441
I can't sleep well.

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:39.600
Even get random nausea and cramps.

00:27:40.401 --> 00:27:41.001
It's like

00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:43.961
I have a cold. Probably stomach flu.

00:27:44.201 --> 00:27:45.992
Get to the point.
What did the doctor say?

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:48.961
The doctor said

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:52.320
this illness is

00:27:52.921 --> 00:27:53.520
hard to cure.

00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:54.881
Unless...

00:27:56.481 --> 00:27:57.320
Unless what?

00:27:57.961 --> 00:27:58.921
Unless the person

00:27:59.161 --> 00:28:00.560
I've been missing

00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:02.401
comes back soon

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:04.040
and

00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:05.520
kisses me.

00:28:06.001 --> 00:28:06.696
That should...

00:28:09.881 --> 00:28:12.201
Did Yan Fei and Guo Xiaoyu
ask you out to dinner?

00:28:12.681 --> 00:28:13.520
How did you know?

00:28:13.921 --> 00:28:15.120
Yan Fei invited me too.

00:28:15.201 --> 00:28:16.481
We're very close now.

00:28:17.881 --> 00:28:19.520
I help her when she's in trouble.

00:28:20.481 --> 00:28:21.560
Honestly, I didn't expect

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:23.241
that someone like Yan Fei

00:28:23.641 --> 00:28:24.560
who is so smart,

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:26.120
righteous,

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:27.721
and straightforward

00:28:28.441 --> 00:28:29.512
would have problems too.

00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:34.600
So, out of my gentleman's instincts,

00:28:34.681 --> 00:28:35.560
I decided...

00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:37.800
You must've seen
Yan Fei's social media post.

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:40.360
If I keep praising her, will you finally

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:41.681
get mad?

00:28:42.481 --> 00:28:43.681
So you did this on purpose?

00:28:49.161 --> 00:28:50.441
It was indeed my mistake.

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:51.800
I apologize to you.

00:28:52.681 --> 00:28:55.760
I shouldn't have allowed it
to take photos with others.

00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:57.040
But

00:28:58.280 --> 00:28:59.641
you're definitely mistaking me.

00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:01.881
Give me a chance to explain.

00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:05.800
You're unfairly casting me aside

00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:07.360
and nearly killing me.

00:29:07.401 --> 00:29:08.648
So you should make it up to me.

00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:11.360
You still have free time

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:12.280
to watch dramas?

00:29:12.641 --> 00:29:14.721
And let's be clear. Who makes it up?

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:18.001
I'll make it up to you.
I made a mistake.

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:19.528
How about this?

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:21.161
Tell Guo Xiaoyu that you won't

00:29:21.161 --> 00:29:21.961
make it to dinner.

00:29:22.401 --> 00:29:23.401
We'll eat alone.

00:29:23.881 --> 00:29:26.280
I'll explain the whole story to you.

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:27.721
Show me some sympathy.

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:29.681
I've had no appetite for days.

00:29:30.641 --> 00:29:32.641
Shouldn't you eat with me?

00:29:33.401 --> 00:29:34.201
Listen up.

00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:35.401
Glib men

00:29:35.481 --> 00:29:36.201
lose pursuers.

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:37.881
You pursue me?

00:29:38.481 --> 00:29:39.040
Since when?

00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:41.520
Go eat. Stop being childish.

00:29:44.481 --> 00:29:45.161
Your phone.

00:29:47.161 --> 00:29:48.800
When did you pursue me?

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:55.600
Low-alcohol cinnamon rock sugar.

00:29:55.721 --> 00:29:56.584
It helps you sleep.

00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:06.681
It tastes good.

00:30:06.681 --> 00:30:07.400
It tastes good.

00:30:08.161 --> 00:30:09.681
So you didn't realize

00:30:09.681 --> 00:30:11.681
that Yan Fei's post
was only visible to Mr. Zhou?

00:30:12.481 --> 00:30:14.280
I thought she just blocked us,

00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:15.840
but forgot to block senior lawyers.

00:30:16.241 --> 00:30:17.360
That's entirely possible.

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:21.800
No wonder people say

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:23.401
that

00:30:23.881 --> 00:30:25.080
people in love are slow

00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:26.161
on the uptake.

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:35.320
How is Yan Fei?

00:30:35.681 --> 00:30:36.201
Not good.

00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:38.481
Otherwise,
she wouldn't ask us out for drinks.

00:30:39.441 --> 00:30:41.401
I saw that photo

00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:43.241
because Zhou Nian stared at it

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:45.520
for a while. He even lost appetite.

00:30:45.961 --> 00:30:47.080
He definitely likes Yan Fei.

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:50.472
Then,

00:30:51.881 --> 00:30:53.520
Mr. Zhou probably has his own concerns.

00:30:53.681 --> 00:30:56.441
Does he feel the gap
between him and Yan Fei is huge

00:30:56.641 --> 00:30:57.280
in every aspect?

00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:58.280
That's why...

00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:00.241
There's a huge gap between us too.

00:31:00.641 --> 00:31:01.681
I don't think so.

00:31:01.681 --> 00:31:02.681
We're both young

00:31:02.681 --> 00:31:03.721
and capable.

00:31:03.721 --> 00:31:05.401
And we're both good-looking.

00:31:05.881 --> 00:31:07.201
I believe we're definitely

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:10.401
visual representatives
of Talent Hunt Program.

00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:12.360
I'm slightly less attractive than you.

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:16.320
You have a father who is a lawyer.

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:17.961
I have a father with a criminal record.

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:19.280
If I were your friend,

00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:20.641
acting on a lawyer's instinct,

00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:21.760
I'd advise you to stop.

00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:24.641
Dating a lawyer

00:31:24.641 --> 00:31:26.161
and getting risk alerts?

00:31:35.681 --> 00:31:36.401
I can't control

00:31:36.401 --> 00:31:38.241
who our fathers are.

00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:40.881
But I can choose who I love.

00:31:41.921 --> 00:31:42.760
I'm serious.

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:46.600
I hope you are the same, Ren Jiatong.

00:32:05.881 --> 00:32:06.520
Why stare at me?

00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:08.481
You only had two drinks.

00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:10.040
Don't pretend to be drunk.

00:32:11.721 --> 00:32:13.040
I think you're beautiful.

00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:14.401
I want to watch you a bit longer.

00:32:14.961 --> 00:32:16.040
Aren't you curious

00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:17.641
about what we did on this trip?

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:20.520
I am curious.
If you tell me, I'll listen.

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:26.481
I've learned so much from Ms. Bai.

00:32:26.721 --> 00:32:28.040
Even when I didn't perform well,

00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:29.520
she didn't criticize me at all.

00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:32.001
Instead, she taught me how to do it.

00:32:32.441 --> 00:32:33.241
You know what?

00:32:33.921 --> 00:32:34.721
Privately,

00:32:34.721 --> 00:32:36.560
she relieves stress by eating junk food.

00:32:38.161 --> 00:32:39.040
It's really adorable.

00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:08.744
Ren Jiatong.

00:33:12.201 --> 00:33:13.360
I really want to know

00:33:14.401 --> 00:33:15.401
if you are serious.

00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:22.560
Is this answer important?

00:33:23.001 --> 00:33:23.688
Yes.

00:33:25.001 --> 00:33:25.760
It matters to me.

00:33:29.721 --> 00:33:30.241

I've outlined the key facts of the case.

00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:38.881
The evidence shows that when they met,

00:37:38.881 --> 00:37:40.481
the guy gave Xia Jun

00:37:40.481 --> 00:37:41.921
a large tennis bag.

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:44.120
During their internal investigation,

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:45.640
they claimed it was filled with cash

00:37:45.841 --> 00:37:46.680
of two million yuan.

00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:48.680
The evidence appears solid.

00:37:48.761 --> 00:37:50.441
But there's no direct proof

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:51.361
that can prove

00:37:51.361 --> 00:37:53.040
that the tennis bag our client held

00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:54.120
actually contained money.

00:37:54.401 --> 00:37:56.040

You have such a good memory.

00:38:52.441 --> 00:38:53.921
You still remember these cases.

00:38:58.160 --> 00:38:58.961
Mr. Song.

00:38:59.281 --> 00:39:01.040
You're feeling nostalgic today.

00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:03.001
That's not like you.

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:05.080
Aren't you the one always looking ahead

00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:07.680
and forgetting the past quickly?

00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:08.321
Right.

00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:10.120
You're right.

00:39:10.961 --> 00:39:12.801
We should move on from the past quickly.

00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:15.720
Reminiscing about the past

00:39:16.001 --> 00:39:17.321
isn't great at our age.

00:39:17.321 --> 00:39:18.001
Stop.

00:39:18.961 --> 00:39:20.200
At our age? What do you mean?

00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:22.560
Sorry, I misspoke.

00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:24.600
Exactly, I meant for my age group.

00:39:25.441 --> 00:39:26.761
I take that back.

00:39:28.424 --> 00:39:29.361
Lovely flowers.

00:39:30.881 --> 00:39:31.520
From Gao Lang.

00:39:32.321 --> 00:39:32.936
Gao Lang?

00:39:35.281 --> 00:39:37.441
So Gao Lang visited you earlier?

00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:41.441
He's a key client.

00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:43.801
Stay connected.

00:39:43.961 --> 00:39:45.160
Sure, we do.

00:39:48.801 --> 00:39:49.640
These flowers

00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:51.961
look nice yet are fragile.

00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:53.841
They won't

00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:55.208
last a few days.

00:40:21.361 --> 00:40:22.481
Had a meeting with Mr. Song?

00:40:22.921 --> 00:40:23.640
Yes.

00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:24.680
I just did a handover.

00:40:24.961 --> 00:40:26.481
What about you? What kept you busy?

00:40:26.921 --> 00:40:28.321
I just had a meeting with Ms. Bai.

00:40:32.401 --> 00:40:34.680
I can show you the meeting notes later.

00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:37.361
Sure, I have interesting notes too.

00:40:37.361 --> 00:40:38.481
We can share them later.

00:40:40.881 --> 00:40:42.001
I'll go grab some water.

00:40:42.361 --> 00:40:43.200
Okay, stay safe.

00:40:44.841 --> 00:40:45.560
No, not that,

00:40:47.361 --> 00:40:48.801
drink more water.

00:40:54.881 --> 00:40:55.560
Jiatong.

00:40:56.001 --> 00:40:56.680
Jiang Chen.

00:40:58.120 --> 00:40:59.200
Juicy gossip.

00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:00.104
Hurry!

00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:18.344
Have you heard?

00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:21.560
The client Ms. Bai just met with

00:41:22.361 --> 00:41:23.720
is her ex-boyfriend.

00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:25.680
And that guy came to see Ms. Bai

00:41:25.841 --> 00:41:27.441
to help his current girlfriend.

00:41:27.881 --> 00:41:28.921
What?

00:41:29.801 --> 00:41:31.401
I didn't know about this in our team.

00:41:31.401 --> 00:41:32.240
But you knew first?

00:41:32.921 --> 00:41:33.881
Be serious.

00:41:34.321 --> 00:41:36.120
Ms. Bai and Mr. Song?

00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:37.001
An ex?

00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:38.481
Just think it over.

00:41:38.801 --> 00:41:39.520
Jiang Chen.

00:41:39.961 --> 00:41:42.200
Get your logic straight, Guo Xiaoyu.

00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:43.600
I don't understand

00:41:43.801 --> 00:41:45.720
your noncontinuous sentence structures.

00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:49.841
I just saw a quite handsome man

00:41:49.841 --> 00:41:51.560
waiting for Ms. Bai.

00:41:52.441 --> 00:41:53.841
Ms. Bai seemed familiar with him.

00:41:53.841 --> 00:41:55.361
That guy even gave her flowers.

00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:57.720
How handsome?

00:41:59.160 --> 00:41:59.921
I confirm it.

00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:01.401
Extremely handsome.

00:42:03.841 --> 00:42:04.488
Wait.

00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:06.640
What do you guys mean?

00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:09.040
No way he's more handsome than my idol.

00:42:10.361 --> 00:42:11.441
Whose side are you even on?

00:42:12.801 --> 00:42:14.200
I'm so furious!

00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:15.720
How could he come to Ms. Bai

00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:16.881
for his current girlfriend?

00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:18.921
What's wrong with these men?

00:42:18.961 --> 00:42:20.160
Are they all heartless?

00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:24.720
Maybe you should add a prerequisite

00:42:25.001 --> 00:42:26.361
to your conclusion.

00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:27.600
Let's be more rigorous.

00:42:27.801 --> 00:42:29.001
Don't target the innocent.

00:42:35.361 --> 00:42:36.600
I'm being quite rigorous.

00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:41.001
I didn't misjudge any bad man.

00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:45.600
I'm just so mad.

00:42:45.961 --> 00:42:48.160
I don't think
Ms. Bai will take this case.

00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:49.961
It's generous
that she didn't kick him out.

00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:51.841
If I hear any fighting noise later

00:42:51.841 --> 00:42:52.801
from Ms. Bai's office,

00:42:52.801 --> 00:42:53.640
I'll be the first one

00:42:53.881 --> 00:42:55.120
to rush in and hit that guy.

00:42:55.441 --> 00:42:56.441
I'll go with a broom.

00:42:58.001 --> 00:42:58.632
Deal.

00:42:58.801 --> 00:42:59.841
If a fight starts later,

00:42:59.841 --> 00:43:00.640
I'll back you up.

00:43:01.801 --> 00:43:02.801
But my gut feeling is

00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:04.281
Ms. Bai will take the case.

00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:06.240
I also think so.

00:43:06.961 --> 00:43:08.961
Ms. Bai doesn't
let emotions affect her work.

00:43:09.921 --> 00:43:10.640
I bet you 100 yuan.

00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:12.401
She won't take it.

00:43:13.321 --> 00:43:14.120
Just wait and see.

00:43:15.291 --> 00:43:17.160
