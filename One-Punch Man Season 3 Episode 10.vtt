00:12.596 --> 00:14.264
How many have I taken down now?

00:14.806 --> 00:15.933
Child Emperor said...

00:16.808 --> 00:19.352
He planned the attack,
so the enemy forces

00:19.353 --> 00:21.897
would be spread out
as much as possible, but...

00:26.068 --> 00:27.027
Yo!

00:34.618 --> 00:36.495
So you're Zombieman, huh?

00:36.703 --> 00:38.121
Then die already!

00:44.461 --> 00:46.171
Isn't this more than my share?

00:48.257 --> 00:52.760
I specialize in undercover ops, espionage,
and investigating contaminated zones.

00:52.761 --> 00:54.471
Fighting isn't exactly my strong suit.

00:54.638 --> 00:55.847
He's bleeding.

00:55.848 --> 00:57.808
Let's put this half-dead guy
out of his misery!

00:58.392 --> 00:59.226
Bring it on.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.944
Oh boy,
this is bone-breaking work...

01:09.069 --> 01:10.988
...literally.

01:12.990 --> 01:16.618
(Immortal Bloodbath)

01:18.954 --> 01:21.123
What's behind these doors?

01:21.915 --> 01:24.668
Whatever it is,
it's definitely not going to be good.

01:29.131 --> 01:31.675
I've been waiting forever, Hero.

01:34.094 --> 01:35.053
A bat?

01:42.352 --> 01:43.853
Threat Level: Demon
Vampire (Purebred)

01:43.854 --> 01:46.439
- Kill each other!
- Don't finish it too quick.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.734
Good luck, Mr. Hero!

01:49.193 --> 01:53.488
Looks like they all want you to die.
What did you do to piss them off?

01:54.072 --> 01:57.242
You're all beasts,
so get along already.

01:57.868 --> 01:59.828
They're just trying to annoy me.

02:00.162 --> 02:04.708
It's jealousy. The talentless always
make the same mistake.

02:04.958 --> 02:08.253
They think a few petty tricks will
somehow close the gap between us.

02:08.378 --> 02:11.173
Start the deathmatch show!

02:11.298 --> 02:13.630
I'll have his innards.

02:13.631 --> 02:16.261
A Class-S hero
with high combat power.

02:16.553 --> 02:19.890
A vampire who feeds on monsters
and is hated by everyone.

02:20.557 --> 02:23.185
No matter which one dies,
it's good for us.

02:23.519 --> 02:25.520
A deathmatch between
two powerful fighters.

02:25.521 --> 02:28.398
Whoever survives won't be left
in one piece.

02:28.524 --> 02:31.276
And that's when we'll surround him
and rip him to pieces.

02:31.401 --> 02:33.779
So, you two go ahead and
get things started.

02:33.904 --> 02:36.240
Show us what you got,
both of you!

02:37.616 --> 02:40.953
Just ignore the noise.
I'll take care of them later.

02:41.078 --> 02:43.413
By the way, are you a Class-S hero?

02:43.747 --> 02:46.291
I'm not well-versed in worldly matters.
State your name!

02:46.583 --> 02:48.961
Apologies, I should've told you my name.

02:49.419 --> 02:50.671
Allow me to introduce myself...

02:53.757 --> 02:57.094
Both of them used surprise attacks,
but Vampire landed the first blow.

02:57.219 --> 02:58.262
This is awesome!

02:59.179 --> 03:00.055
This blood...

03:00.180 --> 03:03.516
is the worst I've ever tasted.
No way can I drink this.

03:03.517 --> 03:06.894
Hey, what's going on?
Is it over already, Mr. Hero?

03:06.895 --> 03:09.105
I bet he's the weakest in Class S.

03:09.106 --> 03:12.401
At least wear him down
a little before you die.

03:12.693 --> 03:13.694
- Oh?!
- Oh?!

03:14.653 --> 03:16.445
Hm? He's getting back up.

03:16.446 --> 03:18.364
I guess he wasn't drained
of all his blood?

03:18.365 --> 03:19.283
Nice!

03:25.122 --> 03:28.041
Trying to stand with
the last of your strength...

03:28.166 --> 03:29.334
Pathetic.

03:29.459 --> 03:32.671
But don't expect your unyielding
sense of justice to be rewarded.

03:32.921 --> 03:34.422
I am Vampire.

03:34.423 --> 03:38.593
The only true monster
in the Monster Association.

03:38.594 --> 03:41.763
A vampire with a bloodline carrying
supernatural powers for generations.

03:41.930 --> 03:45.601
Even after a brief fight,
the difference should be clear.

03:49.771 --> 03:50.731
Go to hell.

03:59.031 --> 04:01.116
Catching bullets is nothing special.

04:01.366 --> 04:02.618
Time to return the favor!

04:04.036 --> 04:05.871
That's what you call an easy win.

04:06.580 --> 04:07.873
Applause, please!

04:09.082 --> 04:12.252
No reaction?
You all have no manners!

04:14.254 --> 04:17.216
Huh? How are you still standing?

04:17.549 --> 04:22.262
Those bullets pierced your vital organs
and destroyed your brain.

04:22.513 --> 04:26.390
Before that, I ripped open
your carotid artery with my fangs.

04:26.391 --> 04:28.352
Has the bleeding already stopped?

04:28.894 --> 04:34.149
I've heard of this before.
A hero said to be immortal...

04:34.775 --> 04:36.276
Hmph, I see.

04:36.902 --> 04:39.530
These guys are fake monsters.

04:41.365 --> 04:44.368
And you're a fake human.

04:44.493 --> 04:45.327
Shut up.

04:48.080 --> 04:50.624
But your ability to regenerate...

04:50.749 --> 04:52.543
Is something you can be proud of.

05:12.187 --> 05:14.189
Let's have some more fun.

05:25.534 --> 05:28.620
Even among fakes, you're different
from the rest of the trash.

05:28.787 --> 05:30.873
You're kind of interesting!

05:31.373 --> 05:33.125
Whoa! It snapped.

05:39.173 --> 05:40.799
You slipped up!

05:44.511 --> 05:48.724
Don't think you're the only one
with regenerative powers.

05:53.520 --> 05:57.024
An inferior species that can't do
a thing without weapons.

05:57.316 --> 05:58.609
So don't get cocky!

05:59.484 --> 06:01.570
Even regeneration has its limits.

06:01.737 --> 06:03.447
Time to get torn to shreds!

06:11.830 --> 06:13.916
Whoa, back away from Vampire!

06:14.041 --> 06:15.876
He'll drain you dry
without thinking twice!

06:16.126 --> 06:18.587
I'm almost fully healed
after sucking on all this blood.

06:18.754 --> 06:22.257
Good thing I had a blood supply nearby.

06:22.591 --> 06:26.512
What about you?
You look more like a zombie now?

06:39.107 --> 06:42.903
I don't feel like moving...
but I guess I've got no choice.

06:44.613 --> 06:46.114
Hey, Vampire.

06:46.281 --> 06:49.785
This is going to be a bloodbath.
Brace yourself.

06:50.577 --> 06:53.413
(30 Minutes Later)

06:58.752 --> 07:02.256
I've killed you over and over...

07:03.340 --> 07:06.927
You should definitely be dead... yet...

07:07.219 --> 07:10.430
Yeah, you beat me about 200 times.

07:10.973 --> 07:12.808
Looks like I finally got my first win.

07:13.141 --> 07:15.602
Vampire lost to Zombieman?

07:16.687 --> 07:18.312
He's not moving. He's dead.

07:18.313 --> 07:22.401
There were so many ways to win.
What an idiot.

07:22.776 --> 07:26.947
It's been a while since
I fought such a tough monster.

07:28.699 --> 07:30.367
Oh man, I'm beat.

07:33.078 --> 07:34.329
He said he's tired.

07:34.705 --> 07:36.707
Hey, where do you think you're going?

07:37.040 --> 07:38.876
There's no time to rest.

07:39.001 --> 07:42.629
Next, you're taking on all of us.

07:47.593 --> 07:52.431
So there's about 30 of you?
No way I'd just run off like that.

07:52.639 --> 07:54.391
Huh? Is he for real?

07:55.100 --> 07:56.976
Your reckless fighting style
won't work on us!

07:56.977 --> 07:59.061
Pin him down! Attack him so fast that
he can't regenerate...

07:59.062 --> 08:00.503
(Punch) (Drag) (Scream)
Pin him down! Attack him so fast that he can't regenerate...

08:00.504 --> 08:02.523
(Punch) (Drag) (Scream) - H-Hey, you go!
- No, you go...

08:02.524 --> 08:04.276
(Punch) (Drag) (Scream)

08:10.449 --> 08:14.578
With these wounds, it'll probably
take a few minutes to fully heal.

08:20.167 --> 08:21.919
Time to take a break...

08:22.586 --> 08:24.171
I just wanna get this over with.

08:24.505 --> 08:27.966
I don't mind the blood...
but I hate sweating.

08:29.009 --> 08:30.302
This is Child Emperor.

08:30.427 --> 08:32.971
I've secured Waganma and
we're heading to the surface.

08:33.347 --> 08:35.849
Everyone, lure the enemy away,
as planned.

08:36.475 --> 08:39.770
Don't be overeager in pursuing them.
The enemy is dangerous...

08:41.313 --> 08:42.523
This is Zombieman.

08:43.273 --> 08:46.068
Thanks. We couldn't
have done it without you.

08:46.485 --> 08:48.153
Let me thank you
on everyone's behalf.

08:49.780 --> 08:51.198
He's doing a good job.

08:52.699 --> 08:53.909
Good, I'm all healed.

08:56.119 --> 08:58.163
Time to go kick some more butt.

08:59.665 --> 09:01.123
Finally, I've been waiting.

09:01.124 --> 09:03.669
Looks like this one's gonna
be a real feast!

09:03.794 --> 09:07.297
All of you are nothing
but food for Big-Eater.

09:07.840 --> 09:11.969
I'm the monster with an endless appetite
that devours everything!

09:12.427 --> 09:16.640
I'll swallow all the heroes whole!

09:19.142 --> 09:21.395
That sounds like quite a fight.

09:21.895 --> 09:23.939
But if it's a Class-S hero,
they should be fine.

09:24.606 --> 09:26.942
We need to focus on our own battles.

09:27.693 --> 09:30.195
Master gave us permission
to go off on our own.

09:30.779 --> 09:32.030
We must not let him down.

09:42.624 --> 09:45.794
They're a private rescue squad
deployed by Mr. Narinki.

09:46.461 --> 09:48.130
Looks like they've been brainwashed.

09:48.505 --> 09:50.214
We'll subdue them without hurting them.

09:50.215 --> 09:51.300
Okay!

09:51.425 --> 09:52.551
Understood.

09:54.928 --> 09:58.682
Here's another bunch of clueless fools
that I can mold to my liking.

09:59.766 --> 10:03.103
Come on you guys,
now's the time to serve me.

10:11.361 --> 10:12.946
How to deal with guns?

10:13.697 --> 10:17.659
Come on, that bullet's even slower
than my sword.

10:20.037 --> 10:21.371
I can go faster.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.420
First, destroy their weapons.

10:28.879 --> 10:32.382
Next, disable their battle suits.
Aim for their elbows and knee joints.

10:32.508 --> 10:33.342
Roger that!

10:42.392 --> 10:44.061
Not as easy as I hoped...

10:44.269 --> 10:46.104
Come on! Go! Go!

10:46.230 --> 10:48.524
Welcome your new comrades!

10:48.899 --> 10:51.902
That monster is
messing with their minds.

10:53.737 --> 10:55.656
Snap out of it!

10:57.824 --> 10:59.743
It's no use trying to persuade them.

11:03.038 --> 11:04.957
Such tremendous strength.

11:05.541 --> 11:06.542
However...

11:10.420 --> 11:13.966
A blade without will is
nothing to be feared!

11:17.135 --> 11:19.471
They're strong enough to be a problem...

11:20.097 --> 11:22.558
How should we deal with this now?

11:22.808 --> 11:26.937
If I attack them from beyond their reach,
they should be helpless.

11:27.396 --> 11:28.272
Right?

11:31.984 --> 11:32.860
Right.

11:35.237 --> 11:37.573
Those are unauthorized
battle suits obtained illegally.

11:37.948 --> 11:39.575
They've got solid martial arts skills.

11:39.741 --> 11:42.369
Keep dodging and
throw off their rhythm!

11:43.745 --> 11:45.330
How cute,
you have so many openings.

11:45.622 --> 11:49.334
Now I will seize
my first new love slave!

11:52.087 --> 11:53.046
With his bare hand?

11:54.089 --> 11:55.299
What the...? Who is it...?!

11:55.966 --> 11:57.176
Amai Mask!!

11:57.926 --> 12:00.470
She's using this whip to
control her underlings.

12:01.388 --> 12:03.307
Probably some kind of
pain-induced hypnosis...

12:04.099 --> 12:06.268
If you get struck by it,
you might lose your willpower.

12:07.269 --> 12:08.812
You guys are at a disadvantage here.

12:09.229 --> 12:10.981
Leave this to me and
fight somewhere else.

12:12.232 --> 12:16.612
I won't get into details,
but I have a simple solution.

12:17.738 --> 12:19.031
Not to worry.

12:19.364 --> 12:21.366
I'm not so weak
as to be brainwashed.

12:21.617 --> 12:23.744
For now, let's trust the superstar.

12:25.954 --> 12:28.248
All right... We're counting on you.

12:31.627 --> 12:32.836
Oh my...

12:33.378 --> 12:36.423
Staying behind alone in this situation?
Are you out of your mind?

12:36.924 --> 12:40.093
Heroes who think like that
are only a burden.

12:40.802 --> 12:44.097
Just as I thought, you're gorgeous.

12:44.806 --> 12:46.266
I'm so happy we met.

12:46.934 --> 12:50.729
Just between you and me...
I've actually been a fan of yours.

12:51.396 --> 12:52.940
So how about it?

12:53.065 --> 12:55.317
Want to sneak off somewhere
and get nice and cozy?

13:00.989 --> 13:04.701
Then just maybe I'll free
them from my control.

13:05.244 --> 13:08.496
Do you really think
I'd agree to such a deal?

13:08.497 --> 13:10.374
You wretched monster!

13:10.624 --> 13:12.084
Brace yourself!

13:13.168 --> 13:15.754
That's mean, Amai Mask.

13:16.421 --> 13:18.382
I'm gonna make you mine,
no matter what.

13:20.175 --> 13:21.426
Something feels off...

13:21.885 --> 13:24.263
What kind of solution
is he talking about?

13:24.555 --> 13:25.681
I don't know.

13:25.806 --> 13:27.266
But he seemed super confident.

13:27.391 --> 13:29.977
He must have a trump card
he doesn't want to show anyone.

13:30.227 --> 13:33.479
He might break the brainwashing by
whipping out a mic

13:33.480 --> 13:35.482
and doing a little musical number.

13:35.816 --> 13:38.193
You expect way too much from idols.

13:39.111 --> 13:40.779
To be a hero...

13:41.029 --> 13:43.198
To be a champion of justice...

13:43.866 --> 13:45.534
evil must be struck down.

13:47.828 --> 13:49.162
Without any hesitation...

13:49.288 --> 13:51.498
Are you really that Amai Mask?

13:52.499 --> 13:53.458
Damn it!

13:56.128 --> 13:58.130
My whip's useless?!

13:58.255 --> 14:00.674
W-Wait! I surrender!

14:03.302 --> 14:06.054
I am at your command.
Master Amai Mask.

14:09.892 --> 14:11.685
Y-You're not human...!

14:11.935 --> 14:14.229
Monsters must die.

14:16.690 --> 14:18.233
What's that sound?

14:18.859 --> 14:20.194
Th-That's... a monster?!

14:20.319 --> 14:22.779
No, maybe Pig God?

14:23.363 --> 14:24.615
What's going on with that?

14:24.740 --> 14:26.283
How does he digest all that?

14:26.742 --> 14:27.784
No idea.

14:28.035 --> 14:30.787
But it feels like
we've seen something we shouldn't have.

14:31.538 --> 14:34.333
Yeah... Let's go a different way...

14:35.417 --> 14:36.627
There's something down below!

14:47.513 --> 14:49.723
Like a moth to a flame.

14:50.265 --> 14:52.475
Heroes of justice diving in
and getting tangled in my hair.

14:52.476 --> 14:53.309
(Threat Level: Demon Malong Hair) Heroes of
justice diving in and getting tangled in my hair.

14:53.310 --> 14:54.144
(Threat Level: Demon
Malong Hair)

14:54.353 --> 14:55.312
A monster...

14:55.687 --> 14:59.399
He's so hot.
He's seducing me.

14:59.942 --> 15:00.776
But I cannot.

15:01.151 --> 15:03.111
He's a monster and I'm a hero.

15:03.445 --> 15:05.489
It's forbidden love.

15:06.031 --> 15:08.825
Hey, the enemy's ability is unknown.

15:09.493 --> 15:11.245
Test him with your Flying Sword.

15:12.329 --> 15:14.540
This fool's falling for a monster again.

15:14.831 --> 15:16.500
Snap out of it, you idiot.

15:16.792 --> 15:18.168
Who are you calling an idiot?

15:18.544 --> 15:20.963
Oh, I get it. You're jealous.

15:21.088 --> 15:22.130
Huh? Can I cut you?

15:22.256 --> 15:23.549
No. Calm down!

15:23.757 --> 15:25.341
This is no time to be fooling around.

15:25.342 --> 15:27.928
Even while we stand here,
battles are raging everywhere.

15:30.597 --> 15:34.852
It's our duty to ease the burden
on Master and the others.

15:35.185 --> 15:38.689
All right. He's a hottie,
but so be it.

15:39.147 --> 15:40.399
I'm sorry.

15:40.732 --> 15:44.361
But I can't reciprocate your feelings.

15:44.486 --> 15:46.947
That came out of nowhere.
I just got dumped.

15:48.031 --> 15:49.116
Flying Sword.

15:53.871 --> 15:57.666
Slicing through the air
creates giant whirlwinds.

15:57.958 --> 16:00.252
I hate to admit it,
but it's a technique I cannot imitate.

16:00.544 --> 16:02.880
A frog in a well knows nothing
of the great ocean.

16:03.380 --> 16:06.216
Class-A heroes know nothing
of the terrors of my hair.

16:07.426 --> 16:10.262
Impossible! He blocked
Flying Sword with his long hair.

16:10.512 --> 16:12.222
And what he said wasn't even clever!

16:14.892 --> 16:16.602
Hey! Behind you! Underground!

16:21.982 --> 16:23.859
Th-Thanks.

16:24.943 --> 16:25.903
What a pain.

16:26.320 --> 16:28.030
The enemy's weapon is his hair.

16:28.447 --> 16:29.947
Since they're thinner than blades

16:29.948 --> 16:32.075
they slip easily through the gaps
in bones and armor.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.244
Don't overlook even a single strand.

16:34.828 --> 16:37.581
His attack methods likely include
more than just piercing.

16:37.706 --> 16:41.043
He can probably bind, constrict,
throw, or slice with his hair.

16:42.961 --> 16:44.462
Like salt on fresh greens

16:44.463 --> 16:46.340
my long hair will drain
the life out of you.

16:53.347 --> 16:54.515
Don't use your eyes!

16:56.225 --> 16:59.352
Use your reflexes to counter
the hair's killing intent.

16:59.353 --> 17:01.103
Like water on a burnt stone...

17:01.104 --> 17:02.773
Fighting long hair with swords is futile.

17:03.899 --> 17:05.733
Letting anything through
will get us killed.

17:05.734 --> 17:06.860
Intercept every attack.

17:06.985 --> 17:09.279
The human head has over
a hundred thousand hairs.

17:09.613 --> 17:11.198
Yet we only have three swords.

17:11.323 --> 17:12.699
This is gonna wear on our nerves.

17:12.824 --> 17:13.825
Here he comes!

17:18.664 --> 17:19.872
Damn it, I'm tangled up.

17:19.873 --> 17:21.750
Like a candle in the wind...

17:21.875 --> 17:23.460
Your lives are about to go out.

17:24.002 --> 17:26.296
Hmph. He has the worst lines.

17:26.755 --> 17:29.382
Don't worry.
As long as he comes into range

17:29.383 --> 17:31.467
I can break his defense
and cut him clean in half.

17:31.468 --> 17:33.262
One hundred thousand?
Bring it on!

17:33.387 --> 17:35.639
I'll slice and shred every last one!

17:45.816 --> 17:48.443
What would Master do
at a time like this...?

17:49.987 --> 17:54.533
What's your take on
Shibabawa's Earthdoom prophecy?

17:55.242 --> 17:58.787
Hm? I suspect it's not the end yet.

17:59.246 --> 18:01.248
Something has been bothering me
this whole time.

18:01.874 --> 18:04.001
What if,
within this Monster Association

18:04.585 --> 18:06.837
there exists an unbelievably
dangerous being...

18:07.880 --> 18:10.965
A monster that
no human could ever defeat

18:10.966 --> 18:13.594
a being that embodies despair itself.

18:14.845 --> 18:16.805
What would you do, Master?

18:23.353 --> 18:25.981
Then I'd have to surpass being human.

18:26.648 --> 18:28.525
That's what Master said, but...

18:28.775 --> 18:31.195
But Class-S heroes like Master,
Tornado and Pig God

18:31.320 --> 18:33.530
have already gone beyond human limits.

18:34.031 --> 18:37.326
We still have a ways to go,
but at least

18:37.576 --> 18:39.244
we'll cling on and
keep pushing forward.

18:48.253 --> 18:50.088
My Achilles' heel is...

18:51.048 --> 18:52.758
My hair.

18:55.844 --> 18:57.429
We... won?

18:57.930 --> 19:01.600
All we did was keep hacking at
the hair that was attacking us.

19:02.059 --> 19:04.645
Oh man...
He was a terrifying opponent

19:04.770 --> 19:07.606
with his relentless attacks
and incredible reach.

19:09.691 --> 19:11.777
It took all three of us
to bring him down.

19:12.236 --> 19:14.488
Are there more like him?

19:15.322 --> 19:18.200
The remaining monsters are
gonna be pretty tough as well.

19:18.534 --> 19:21.036
Yeah. There's no time to rest.

19:21.411 --> 19:23.789
Although I'm sure Master
isn't having any problems.

19:37.010 --> 19:40.264
Luring them in and slashing them
all down with a single swing.

19:40.389 --> 19:43.350
You are indeed a great swordsman,
Atomic Samurai.

19:44.518 --> 19:47.020
Did someone escape my blade?

19:47.479 --> 19:50.107
I offered my soul to my blade
and became

19:50.232 --> 19:52.192
the Sword Demon Chopper-Upper.

19:52.401 --> 19:55.111
I will feast on your blood
and charge forward

19:55.112 --> 19:56.989
on the path to unrivaled supremacy!

20:00.367 --> 20:01.410
We're even...

20:01.660 --> 20:02.703
Even...

20:03.328 --> 20:04.288
All right then.

20:04.413 --> 20:08.417
Is this everyone? Raise your hand
if you didn't get slashed.

20:10.544 --> 20:12.004
I am Machine God G5.

20:12.462 --> 20:15.465
I have obtained your combat data.

20:15.966 --> 20:19.344
I have completely copied
your sword skills.

20:19.845 --> 20:23.473
Stop your futile resistance
and offer up your neck.

20:24.224 --> 20:25.142
Tsk.

20:30.814 --> 20:31.871
I'm surprised.

20:32.191 --> 20:37.154
Toys these days are so well-made.
I should order one online.

20:37.571 --> 20:39.364
Your bravado won't last.

20:40.115 --> 20:42.743
I will gradually increase
my attack speed.

20:42.951 --> 20:44.620
You're making me yawn.

20:45.204 --> 20:47.247
Crank up your performance.

20:47.456 --> 20:50.709
I thought my disciples could
at least practice on you, but...

20:51.376 --> 20:53.253
You are mistaken.

20:53.670 --> 20:56.632
My true strength isn't just
about copying your techniques

20:56.757 --> 20:57.925
it's upgrading them.

20:58.300 --> 21:00.843
As a robot, I can create
unknown sword techniques

21:00.844 --> 21:03.972
that defy the limitations
of human joint mobility.

21:04.515 --> 21:07.976
Virtual combat calculations complete.
Maximum speed!

21:10.562 --> 21:12.523
Atomic Slash Two-Blade Style.

21:18.111 --> 21:19.988
Nothing but a cheap knockoff, huh?

21:25.285 --> 21:28.622
There's something especially hard
embedded in the core.

21:28.830 --> 21:30.624
There were parts
I couldn't slice through.

21:32.584 --> 21:34.336
A weasel's last gasp, huh?

21:34.461 --> 21:36.171
You just don't know when to quit.

21:38.799 --> 21:40.467
Damn it. He got away.

21:41.051 --> 21:42.927
I'll have the surface team
take care of it.

21:42.928 --> 21:45.013
They're quite skilled too.

21:45.722 --> 21:50.060
In fact, their impromptu teamwork
may even be better than ours...

21:50.352 --> 21:52.646
Help! Help!

21:53.021 --> 21:55.065
Help! Someone help me!

21:55.732 --> 21:56.692
Stop!

21:57.359 --> 21:57.817
(Stomp Stomp)

21:57.818 --> 21:59.819
Hey, kid. Hey, stop.
(Stomp Stomp)

21:59.820 --> 22:00.611
(Stomp Stomp)

22:00.612 --> 22:03.489
I'm not gonna do anything to you.
I'm just gonna kill you. (Stomp Stomp)

22:03.490 --> 22:03.990
(Stomp Stomp)

22:03.991 --> 22:05.782
I'll make it fast. It'll be over
in a flash. (Stomp Stomp)

22:05.783 --> 22:05.966
(Stomp Stomp)

22:12.958 --> 22:15.460
Well, well... You've got moves.

22:16.920 --> 22:20.048
Are you trying to pick a fight with me?

22:30.934 --> 22:34.478
Power to The People

22:34.479 --> 22:39.735
With my mighty arm
I'll bring this to an end

22:44.489 --> 22:48.284
It's my Turn!

22:48.285 --> 22:50.411
Here we go again

22:50.412 --> 22:52.580
We swarm the Association as a pack!

22:52.581 --> 22:53.706
Dangerous to the max

22:53.707 --> 22:55.249
Already at the limit

22:55.250 --> 22:57.543
It can't get any worse! But...

22:57.544 --> 22:59.670
Oh oh oh oh oh

22:59.671 --> 23:01.923
Victory isn't about numbers

23:01.924 --> 23:04.217
Hi hi hi hi hi

23:04.218 --> 23:06.552
Show time
Let's turn it up!

23:06.553 --> 23:14.810
Overcome every trial
thrown at you by the heavens

23:14.811 --> 23:18.899
Raise the fist of fire!

23:19.191 --> 23:21.693
Stand up and fight
That's what you call a hero!

23:21.985 --> 23:23.444
Anytime, anywhere

23:23.445 --> 23:28.241
Crush all the evil monsters that attack!

23:28.242 --> 23:33.037
Come on, more (more), more (more)
I need the rush

23:33.038 --> 23:37.459
This isn't enough
No satisfied yeah!

23:37.835 --> 23:41.880
Just be stronger than anyone, anyone
Hey!

23:42.297 --> 23:46.343
Dance, dance across the sky
of destruction! Hey!

23:46.718 --> 23:51.014
Always, always finish it in one blow!

23:51.890 --> 23:55.394
One Punch!

23:55.978 --> 24:00.941
(Top Dragons)
