WEBVTT

00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.040
And beg forgiveness...

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.540
for making Mi So the guilty party
with your lies.

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.680
And acknowledge and accept Mi So.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.480
Just like Se Ri is both my daughter
and your daughter,

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.120
the same goes for Mi So.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.620
I told you I have nothing to do
with that girl.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.290
I said not to mention your dead daughter
in relation to me again.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:22.160
Someone with no feelings
would deny it this desperately?

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.260
If you truly felt nothing,
you wouldn't be acting this way.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:26.660
You...

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.770
For ten months as an unwed mother,

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.240
it must have been so hard for you,
hiding it from the world.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:35.640
I know what that's like.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:38.080
Because I went through the same thing.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:42.110
So instead of blaming yourself,

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.050
you can still acknowledge and accept her
as your daughter.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.730
No, I'm not her mother.

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.260
What makes you think I'm her mother?

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.400
- I said I'm not.
- Why are you doing this? Let me go!

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.000
I should be asking you that!
Why are you doing this?

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:03.700
- Why?
- Let go!

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.410
- Why on earth are you doing this to me?
- I said, let go of me!

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.760
The person you called is unavailable.
Connecting to voicemail.

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.700
Could something bad have happened to her?

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.670
I should have just followed her,
even though she told me not to.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.610
She said it was Andeok Reservoir, right?

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.160
What's wrong?

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.030
Where's Lucia?

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.800
Answer me.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.340
Where's Lucia?

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.240
You were just with her, weren't you?

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.350
Where is Lucia?

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.750
I didn't meet her.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.320
- What?
- I said, I didn't see her!

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.160
Stop lying and tell me the truth.
Where is she?

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.930
What on earth did you do to her?

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.000
Are you going to tell me or not?
Speak! I said, speak!

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.540
What did you do to her?

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.370
Are you not going to talk? If anything...

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.140
What do you think you're doing?

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.810
If anything happened to her,

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.450
I swear, you won't get away with it.

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:30.980
Mark my words.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.350
I'll make you pay.

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.060
What in the world is going on?

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.630
I've never seen Moon Tae Kyung
that angry before.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.140
Andeok Reservoir.

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:54.770
Andeok...

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.290
So what? Am I supposed to let that woman
take Se Ri from me?

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.420
You think I'm crazy?

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.290
Did I raise her with such care
just to lose her to a woman like that?

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:16.690
Se Ri is my daughter.

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.000
No matter what anyone says,
she's my daughter.

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:23.640
I'm not sure if you need legal advice
right now,

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.970
or if you just need a shoulder to cry on,
considering the affection we've shared.

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.170
Honestly, I'm conflicted.

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.110
I have no regrets...

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.680
even if that woman really dies.

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.130
Ms. Ja Kyung.

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.370
You waltz in after being out all night
and stirring up so much trouble?

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:04.510
I just went to my parents' place,

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.380
and my mom insisted I stay the night.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.880
By the way, is Se Ri still not back?

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.320
No, she's not.

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.750
Because of all this,
Ms. Kyung Chae is beside herself.

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:18.920
You really need to watch your mouth.

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.160
I told you you'd cause a huge problem
because of that big mouth of yours.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.160
I mean,

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:29.270
it's not right for the one who should know
to be kept in the dark.

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:32.000
Besides, Se Ri...

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.510
was curious about her birth mother,
wasn't she?

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:39.910
You'll live a long life.
It's always the shameless ones who do.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.510
You say whatever you want,
then run off to your parents' place...

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:43.580
when things get messy.

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:44.850
It must be nice.

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:13.140
Lucia!

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.320
Lucia!

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:23.720
Lucia!

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:28.390
Lucia!

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:31.600
Lucia!

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:34.970
Lucia!

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:40.000
Lucia.

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.040
Lucia!

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.680
Lucia!

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:49.510
Lucia, wake up. Please?

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.020
What happened to you?

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.860
Did Min Kyung Chae do this to you?

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:06.200
We got into a bit of a scuffle.

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:10.970
What? So she hurt you
and just left you here like this?

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:17.140
What is wrong with that family?

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:20.710
That's it. Let's get you to a hospital.

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:42.130
Do you know how smart Mi So was?

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.940
She took after you and your sharp mind.

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:46.800
She was always at the top of her class.

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:51.580
Her picky eating always bugged me,

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:54.010
but now I realize she gets that from you.

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:56.150
And her face...

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:00.450
She's the spitting image of you.

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:05.490
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:11.560
She looks like me?

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:13.560
Her eyes, her nose, her mouth.

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:16.470
There's not a single feature
that isn't yours.

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:20.000
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.670
Why would you look like me?

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.880
After everything I did to you!

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:25.380
Why?

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:27.750
Why?

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.000
Ms. Se Ri is with that woman, isn't she?

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:53.800
I knew it.

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:58.240
We have to bring her back.
Should I go and get her myself?

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:20.670
Did you have a hard day?

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:25.240
What are you doing?
What if something goes wrong?

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:26.470
Let go.

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:31.110
- Do you want to die?
- Is dying such a big deal?

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:34.250
In fact, dying like this would be easy.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.880
Someone jumped from a high place.

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:40.080
What are you talking about?

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:41.890
Manager Gong.

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:45.160
I heard the girl looked like me.

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:47.730
The girl looked exactly like me.

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:51.860
I was always a bit upset
that Se Ri looks nothing like me.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.030
But I heard that girl and I
are like two peas in a pod.

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:58.040
Isn't that hilarious?

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:02.810
Get a grip. What's gotten into you?

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:04.180
Manager Gong.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.910
I can't be her mother.

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:10.210
What kind of mother
does that to her own daughter?

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:13.080
What kind of mother would drive
her own daughter to her death?

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.150
I...

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:18.690
I can't be her mother.
Right, Manager Gong?

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.590
I said, get a grip!

00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:24.160
You need to pull yourself together.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.930
If you don't,
you're going to lose Ms. Se Ri.

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:27.800
Is that what you want?

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.600
Don't think about anything else.

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:36.010
Just focus on protecting Ms. Se Ri.
All right?

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:42.310
(Mingang Distribution)

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:48.690
I need a word with you.

00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:58.560
Whatever you have to say,
you can say it here.

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:00.800
Here?

00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:05.100
I doubt this will be
a pleasant conversation.

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:07.940
You want your employees to overhear this?

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:18.750
Min Kyung Chae.

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.520
Do you have any idea
what you did yesterday?

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.420
If I'd been any later,
that woman could have died.

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:25.720
"That woman?"

00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:30.360
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Will you keep playing dumb to the end?

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:33.200
Yesterday, at Andeok Reservoir...

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:35.170
You're making less and less sense.

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:38.840
Why are you trying to intimidate someone
who has nothing to do with this?

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.570
"Nothing to do with this?"

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:48.010
Are you really completely uninvolved?

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:51.950
Why do you people have such little regard
for human life?

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:54.950
Why do you people
take other people's lives so lightly?

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:58.190
What gives you the right?
Who do you think you are?

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.860
So I should just stand by
while someone tries to take what's mine?

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:03.990
Could you do that?

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:06.360
Could you live with someone
taking what's yours?

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:08.130
So you're fine with taking from others,

00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:09.730
but you can't take it
when they take yours?

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.970
That's exactly what you call
a thief's mentality.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:16.170
Fine. I'm going to watch and see
how this ends for you...

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.410
with that warped,
thieving mindset of yours.

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:22.410
From now on,
you're going to lose everything,

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:24.920
one piece at a time.

00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:39.360
What's with Director Moon?

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:41.430
He looked like he was ready to hit you.

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:42.600
Please help me.

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:44.540
This is the last thing I'll ever ask.

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:47.170
The last thing you'll ask?

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:49.140
I'll make it worth your while,

00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:50.910
so you have to do this for me.

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:00.480
They're a hopeless bunch.

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:03.020
What is wrong with every single person
in that family?

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:05.760
So what's Lucia's plan now?

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:07.760
She'll call a board meeting
or a shareholders' meeting soon...

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:09.330
to officially take over as chairman,

00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:11.600
and then get rid of that family.

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:15.370
She absolutely should.
She can't just let them stay.

00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:18.900
Otherwise, who's to say
there won't be more victims like us?

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:23.440
Mr. Moon.

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:25.380
Why isn't my mom here?

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:27.750
Nothing happened to her, right?

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:29.550
Well, it's just...

00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:32.780
She's just really busy at the company.

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:34.290
That's a lie.

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:36.720
My mom isn't like that.

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:39.160
Something happened to her, right?

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:40.760
Your mom got hurt.

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:44.060
Your oldest sister nearly killed her.

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:49.370
Mom!

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:50.730
Se Ri.

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:54.240
What are you doing here so late?

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:55.510
Where did you get hurt?

00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:56.740
Are you hurt badly?

00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:00.410
No, just a little.
It's just a few bruises.

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.610
I heard Kyung Chae did this.

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:07.720
No. It was Madam Jang.

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:13.460
I think she was upset that you left home
to come live with me.

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:15.160
We had a bit of an argument.

00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:16.890
But to hurt someone just for that...

00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:20.530
What has gotten into Kyung Chae?

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:24.400
I'm okay, all right? Don't be upset.

00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:31.580
Ja Kyung may have a big mouth,
but she's a sweet and innocent kid.

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:34.550
I'm worried she'll anger that darn family
because of this.

00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:36.310
I suppose so.

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:38.450
It's not a secret anymore
that her oldest sister-in-law...

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:40.580
gave birth to her youngest sister-in-law
and raised her.

00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:42.990
Everyone knows about it,
except for the one person who should,

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:45.660
and just sweeping it under the rug
isn't right either.

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.530
If they mess with Ja Kyung for this,

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:50.460
I'm going to show them
just how rough I can be.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
My anger toward that darn family
is already through the roof.

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.630
You've had hard feelings for that family.

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:59.870
Hard feelings is putting it lightly.
When we married off Ja Kyung and Ji Seop,

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:01.510
what did that family say he was?

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:04.310
They said he was heir apparent,
the real power, and a rising star.

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:07.180
He fell from grace
before he even had a chance to rise.

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.550
I provided them business funds
and married her off,

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:10.580
completely in the dark.

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:13.420
You're right.
Back then, Ji Seop did act like...

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:15.820
he was about to become CEO
or even chairman.

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:20.190
Ji Seop might be a little dim,
but he's such a sensitive and kind man.

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:22.090
But they treat him like a burden,

00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:25.500
while his tough sisters
get all the top spots.

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:28.470
You're right. That tormented us so much.

00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:30.500
We even brought him this good luck charm
for a promotion.

00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:33.800
Ja Kyung may have made a mistake,
but if they give her a hard time,

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:35.370
I'll just...

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:42.150
Honey! Oh, my goodness!
I think you dislocated your jaw.

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:45.080
- Oh, my gosh! Goodness!
- Is it okay?

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:46.880
- No, it's not. You...
- It's not okay?

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:48.290
- What do we do?
- I think I'm okay.

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:50.950
Oh, my! What do we do? Your jaw is locked.

00:15:51.690 --> 00:15:52.990
Oh, no.

00:15:57.190 --> 00:15:59.700
Gosh, seriously. Come on.

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:01.470
Knock it off!

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:05.540
As if tiptoeing around Manager Gong
all day wasn't enough.

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:07.770
So why did you have to say that to Se Ri?

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:11.180
You have any idea how on edge
Kyung Chae is after Se Ri ran away?

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:14.180
She's not going to just let this go.
You know what she's like.

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:17.180
Yes?

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:21.050
Mr. Ji Seop.

00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:22.790
Ms. Kyung Chae would like to see you now.

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:25.160
Me?

00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:28.860
- You mean me, not her?
- Yes.

00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:31.460
No, that can't be right.
She must mean my wife.

00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:35.600
She wants to see you.

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:38.170
No, wait. Manager Gong. Are you sure?

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:39.270
Yes.

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:54.450
You wanted to see me?

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:59.990
Ja Kyung didn't mean any harm by
what she said to Se Ri.

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:03.430
You know how clueless she can be.

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:05.900
That's not the issue right now.

00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:10.230
- That woman is holding Se Ri hostage.
- What's that supposed to mean?

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:11.540
Who is "that woman?"

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.140
Don't tell me it's Lucia.

00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:16.470
Hey.

00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:20.240
It looks like Lucia is using Se Ri
as a hostage against us.

00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:24.110
- Se Ri is with that woman?
- Se Ri is one thing,

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:25.680
but I have a feeling...

00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:27.890
that woman is about to pull something.

00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:29.190
Pull what?

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:40.130
(Mingang Distribution)

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:48.470
What?

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:50.570
Did you think I was going
to freeze to death?

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:52.740
Are you surprised
to see me back in one piece?

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:54.880
Are you not going to apologize?

00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:58.080
What did I do wrong?

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:01.320
What did you say? You left me for dead.

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:04.490
You weren't the only one out there.
It was the same for me.

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:06.220
I almost died.

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:10.230
You're the one who started this fight.

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:12.860
Send Se Ri back right now.

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:15.800
Keeping another woman's daughter
from her own mother...

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:18.400
proves just how wrong you are.

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:20.600
I'm not the one "keeping" her.

00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:24.370
Se Ri is the one clinging to me.
It's the blood tie.

00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:26.880
Don't you dare tell Se Ri
that you're her birth mother.

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.080
If you do, I'll take you down with me.

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:30.480
I see.

00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:35.090
I hadn't thought of that.
Thanks for the tip.

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:39.660
If things go south,
I can just spill everything to Se Ri.

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:42.090
Thanks for the tip.

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:44.430
Don't you dare mess with my daughter.

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:46.800
You really don't care...

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:50.270
about Mi So, do you?

00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:54.910
Why should I have to care
about your daughter?

00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:57.770
You couldn't even protect your own child.

00:18:58.710 --> 00:18:59.910
I'm not like you.

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:03.050
No matter what happens,
I will protect my child.

00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:04.850
I will protect my Se Ri!

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:09.420
I clearly gave you one last chance,
and you're the one who threw it away.

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:12.560
From now on, whatever I do...

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:15.660
is for Mi So, the daughter
who was utterly rejected...

00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:19.030
by her own birth mother.
Keep that in mind.

00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:27.540
(Mingang Distribution)

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:33.040
We need to prepare
for the shareholders' meeting.

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:36.950
I'll officially take the chairmanship
and make those people pay.

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:38.980
Are you ready for this?

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:43.050
All right. Let's get right on it.

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:45.490
(Mingang Distribution)

00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:54.570
Make sure that woman doesn't become
the chairman of Mingang Distribution.

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:56.470
Do whatever it takes to stop her.

00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:58.640
Is this the last favor you'll ask of me?

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:03.540
- If I succeed, then I...
- I told you I'd make it worthwhile.

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:06.910
The chairman's slush fund you embezzled?
I'll look the other way.

00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:09.250
So do whatever it takes.

00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:12.820
File a lawsuit to return the gifted stake
and get an injunction.

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:14.850
Do everything you legally can.

00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:18.620
And if that doesn't work,
then by any means necessary,

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:21.430
stop that woman
from becoming the chairman!

00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:27.000
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:40.880
You've decided to be Mingang's lapdog
to the very end?

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:43.150
And here I thought you might have changed.

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:45.920
I thought I told you.

00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:48.890
I'm going to be Kim Sun Jae
until the very end.

00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:52.520
Committing all kinds of crimes
by Min Kyung Chae's side...

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:54.320
and covering up the family's corruption.

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:55.660
Is that your job, Lawyer Kim?

00:20:56.530 --> 00:20:58.730
Then what exactly is
the Moon Tae Kyung way?

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:01.430
Cozying up with another man's woman...

00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:03.970
and getting revenge for your parents
without getting your own hands dirty?

00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:06.040
You should be ashamed of yourself.

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:08.310
If you were a real man,

00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:10.870
you'd at least storm Chairman Min's house
with a knife.

00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:12.280
I told you.

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:16.710
That I would make them pay
through the law, not personal vengeance.

00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:18.520
Go ahead. Give it your best shot.

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:21.990
But too bad for you. Punishing the head
of a conglomerate in this country...

00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:23.790
isn't exactly easy.

00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:25.090
That "not exactly easy" task...

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:27.320
is what I'm going to do.

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:37.000
Go ahead and try.

00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:38.570
Like that'll ever happen.

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:50.350
Let me tell you who we are.
My name is Oh Ja Kyung.

00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:52.250
Oh, my gosh, Se Ri!

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:55.090
What are you doing here?

00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:58.760
- Manager Gong, what are you doing here?
- Pack your things now.

00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:00.060
That's right, Se Ri.

00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:02.660
Your father insisted
that we bring you back.

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:04.900
I want to stay here with my mom.

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:07.500
Your mom? What do you mean, your mom?
Why would you call her that?

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:10.000
I told you your mother is Ms. Kyung Chae.

00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:14.570
I don't want to hear it.
I'll pack your bags later, so let's go.

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:16.670
Come on. Let's go.

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:18.440
What are you waiting for, Ms. Ja Kyung?

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:20.910
- Let's go!
- Gosh, seriously!

00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:22.050
Let's go.

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:24.250
What are you doing?

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:25.380
Wait!

00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:27.380
How dare you barge into
someone else's hotel room like this...

00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:28.790
and cause such a scene?

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:31.720
Besides, she said she doesn't want to go.

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:34.660
Forcing her against her will
is just wrong, don't you think?

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:42.330
I've been meaning to teach you a lesson.

00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:43.530
This is perfect.

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:46.200
What are you looking at?

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:50.670
Oh, my. You have no class!

00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:53.340
- Ja Kyung, what brings you to call me?
- Oh, my!

00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:55.150
- Let go!
- Oh, my!

00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:56.580
Where are you? Why is it so loud?

00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:59.350
We're at Madam Jang's hotel room,
and it's chaos here!

00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:01.250
Manager Gong and Madam Jang are...

00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:02.590
You need to get here quickly.

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:06.990
Hey, Se Ri. What's going on?

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:09.530
(Mingang Distribution)

00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:10.630
What did you say?

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:13.400
Okay. I'm on my way.

00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:20.670
Are you going because of Se Ri?

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:22.040
Because it's about my daughter.

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:24.780
Perfect. I'm going for my daughter too.

00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:27.040
Should we have
a three-way confrontation there?

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:30.680
Why don't we just tell Se Ri?
I'm curious to see how she'll react...

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:32.280
once she knows I'm her birth mother.

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:33.720
Shut your mouth!

00:23:34.450 --> 00:23:35.920
I will protect Se Ri.

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:37.990
I protect my own daughter.

00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:40.490
I will never lose her again.

00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:42.090
I will never lose my child again!

00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:54.500
- Oh, my!
- Let go of me!

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:59.380
- Oh, my!
- You!

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:00.710
- Oh, my!
- Why, you woman...

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:03.880
- I told you I'd teach you a lesson!
- Oh, my!

00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:06.380
- Oh, my!
- Ms. Se Ri...

00:24:06.850 --> 00:24:09.820
- No...
- What do you think you're doing?

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:13.190
How dare you pull her hair?
Who do you think you are?

00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:15.290
- Oh, my!
- Ms. Kyung Chae.

00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:20.330
This is ridiculous.
She's the one who grabbed my hair first.

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:24.940
She's the one who barged in here
and caused a scene brainlessly!

00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:28.770
So why did you hide Se Ri?
Even if that woman brought her here,

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:30.970
you shouldn't have been manipulated by her
since you're older than her.

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:32.980
You should've sent Se Ri home instead.

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:35.210
She said she didn't want to go.
What was I supposed to do?

00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:39.650
Anyone would think we kidnapped Se Ri
based on how you're acting.

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:43.020
What's the difference?
You might as well have kidnapped her.

00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:45.490
Why are you so fixated on my daughter?

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:48.230
No matter what anyone says,
Se Ri is my daughter!

00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:51.600
Mom.

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:54.560
We're going home now!

00:24:56.730 --> 00:24:57.770
Come on.

00:24:58.400 --> 00:24:59.400
Wait...

00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:01.640
Why are you doing this to me?

00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:09.210
Madam Jang, are you all right?

00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:13.180
Why are you just standing there?
Are you just going to let her take Se Ri?

00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:18.120
Min Kyung Chae looked unhinged.
I was afraid Se Ri would get hurt.

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:21.360
True. She looked completely unhinged.

00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:24.390
I get angrier the more I think of it.

00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:26.800
Se Ri isn't even her real daughter,
to be honest.

00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:30.330
You'd think Se Ri was her own daughter
from the way she acts.

00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:33.470
And didn't she claim
Mi So wasn't her daughter?

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:36.140
Once she admits Mi So is her daughter,

00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:38.110
her whole world will fall apart.
That must be why.

00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:41.140
She'd have to admit
that she, the birth mother,

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:43.480
was the one who drove her own daughter
to her death.

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:46.480
But how long can she
bury her head in the sand?

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:51.050
No matter how hard it is,
she has to face the truth and accept it.

00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:01.670
Let go of me!
We're home, isn't that enough?

00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:03.600
You are never going back there again.

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:06.770
This has nothing to do with whether or not
you accept me as your mother.

00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:09.540
It's my decision whether I go or not.
Who are you to tell me what to do?

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:27.560
Do you know why that woman
came into our lives?

00:26:28.530 --> 00:26:29.830
She came for revenge.

00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:34.200
Why would Mom want revenge?
What grudge could she have with us?

00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:38.470
Do you remember that assault case
from four years ago?

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:43.940
You know how I bribed the media
and reporters to cover it up...

00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:45.780
and had them publish fake articles, right?

00:26:47.210 --> 00:26:48.240
But that's not all.

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:52.720
I even bribed the witnesses
to say you were the victim,

00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:55.120
and I framed her as the attacker.

00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:57.350
Why are you bringing that up
all of a sudden?

00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:59.690
The girl from that incident was Mi So.

00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:03.530
The poor victim who was framed
as the attacker in your place.

00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:06.060
That was Mi So.

00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:07.900
Can you imagine how wronged
she must've felt...

00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:09.300
that she jumped from our company building?

00:27:09.970 --> 00:27:11.800
Her name was Mi So!

00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:15.370
So what? Who cares if her name was Mi So?

00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:17.640
Lucia is Mi So's mother.

00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:23.380
That's a lie.

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:27.750
You're lying! How could her mom be my mom?

00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:29.650
If you don't believe me,
go ask her yourself.

00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:33.090
She came to our family
to take revenge on you.

00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:35.330
Do you understand now?

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:39.630
The reason why you can never
go near that woman again.

00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:46.000
What am I going to do?

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:48.870
What am I going to do, Kyung Chae?

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:53.280
Don't worry.

00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:55.750
I'll take care of everything.

00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:58.850
Just like I did four years ago,

00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:01.180
I'll fix it all for you.

00:28:03.250 --> 00:28:04.550
This time, not as your sister,

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:07.520
but as your mother.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.810
