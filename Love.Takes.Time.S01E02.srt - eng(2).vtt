00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:01.033
(This drama is based on a true story.)

00:00:01.033 --> 00:00:02.033
(The plot was adjusted for entertainment purposes only.)

00:00:02.033 --> 00:00:03.033
(We have no intention to offend any careers, )

00:00:03.033 --> 00:00:04.033
(encourage immoral sexual values, )

00:00:04.033 --> 00:00:05.033
(or create a pessimistic disposition of a gender or a group of people.)

00:00:05.034 --> 00:00:07.866
(We would like to apologize in advance for any misunderstandings.)

00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:16.333
(Presents)

00:00:19.833 --> 00:00:26.333
(Theory of Love)

00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:28.333
Do you really not like guys?

00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:29.533
I don’t like guys.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.166
Then prove it.

00:00:32.633 --> 00:00:36.100
You’re expressing that you’re in love with someone.

00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:37.333
Like this?

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.700
She kissed you

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.933
and flirted with you.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.666
You slept with her, didn’t you?

00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:44.400
Sandy, don’t be ridiculous.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.500
That woman is of no use in your life at all.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.333
She doesn’t even love you that much.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.266
Almost ten years... what was all of that?

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.400
Tell me.

00:00:53.633 --> 00:00:55.266
What am I to you?

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.566
Where are you going?

00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:40.166
It’s late.

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:41.766
How long was I asleep?

00:01:45.366 --> 00:01:48.000
You were probably tired, so you fell asleep.

00:01:48.733 --> 00:01:49.800
If you’re still sleepy,

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.266
you can keep resting.

00:01:51.633 --> 00:01:52.866
You can even sleep over.

00:01:55.633 --> 00:01:56.633
Wait.

00:01:57.566 --> 00:01:58.566
April.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.633
About what happened tonight...

00:02:03.466 --> 00:02:06.866
I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean to.

00:02:08.266 --> 00:02:09.400
Where are you going?

00:02:10.466 --> 00:02:11.566
Are you going to see Sandy?

00:02:12.733 --> 00:02:14.100
So what are you two then?

00:02:14.966 --> 00:02:16.433
She’s my best friend.

00:02:17.566 --> 00:02:18.900
Please excuse me. I’m sorry.

00:03:55.366 --> 00:04:00.066
Happy birthday to you

00:04:06.933 --> 00:04:07.933
Make a wish.

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.933
The only wish I have

00:04:13.833 --> 00:04:16.633
is to always have Tan in my life, Aoy and Chod.

00:04:17.866 --> 00:04:20.533
I hope we always have each other.

00:04:36.933 --> 00:04:37.933
Happy birthday.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:40.900
Thank you.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.400
Here.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.800
Happy birthday.

00:05:07.433 --> 00:05:09.166
I wish you lots of happiness.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.200
And here,

00:05:14.566 --> 00:05:15.566
this is your present.

00:05:26.233 --> 00:05:28.433
You told me not to get anything expensive,

00:05:30.033 --> 00:05:31.400
so I got you these.

00:05:33.733 --> 00:05:34.733
Here.

00:05:36.233 --> 00:05:38.300
This one is mine,

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.633
and this one is yours.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.833
They’re so adorable.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.100
Thank you.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.000
I thought you wouldn’t come this year.

00:06:01.366 --> 00:06:02.366
Of course I would.

00:06:02.833 --> 00:06:03.833
I have to come.

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:11.700
Sandy.

00:06:15.233 --> 00:06:16.233
I'm sorry.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.300
I was a little stressed out.

00:06:20.466 --> 00:06:22.666
I went out for a drink and fell asleep.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.733
When I woke up, I came here right away.

00:06:28.933 --> 00:06:30.733
I'm really sorry.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:32.600
It's okay.

00:06:33.633 --> 00:06:34.633
I understand.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.333
No wonder you reeked of alcohol the moment you walked in.

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.266
Invite me next time.

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.166
Eat some more.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.133
No.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.200
Sandy.

00:07:16.133 --> 00:07:17.500
About April

00:07:21.233 --> 00:07:23.000
and our fight at lunch...

00:07:24.433 --> 00:07:26.866
when I didn’t ask you to join our work discussion,

00:07:27.533 --> 00:07:28.533
I’m sorry.

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:32.200
I’m also sorry

00:07:33.066 --> 00:07:34.366
for being rude to you.

00:07:35.333 --> 00:07:37.333
If you were still mad at me

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.866
and didn’t come see me like you used to every year,

00:07:42.733 --> 00:07:43.833
I would have understood.

00:07:48.733 --> 00:07:49.800
Like I said,

00:07:50.666 --> 00:07:51.800
I have to come.

00:07:53.133 --> 00:07:55.266
I wasn’t mad at you.

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:00.100
Then,

00:08:01.233 --> 00:08:02.500
can I ask you for something?

00:08:04.533 --> 00:08:06.500
If anything comes up with April,

00:08:08.133 --> 00:08:10.200
I want you to be honest with me.

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:13.400
If you have to discuss work,

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:15.400
I want to join you.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.133
I honestly don’t trust this woman.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:33.500
Well...

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:37.366
you should go to bed. I’ll get going.

00:08:38.333 --> 00:08:39.333
Tan.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.433
It’s really late,

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:43.033
and you’ve been drinking.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.633
You should stay over.

00:08:45.933 --> 00:08:47.933
I wouldn’t be comfortable

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:49.600
if you were to drive home now.

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:51.533
- I... - Tan.

00:09:50.866 --> 00:09:52.700
Happy birthday.

00:10:19.266 --> 00:10:20.466
Happy birthday.

00:10:21.033 --> 00:10:22.766
I wish you lots of happiness.

00:10:31.966 --> 00:10:32.966
Tan.

00:10:34.766 --> 00:10:35.766
Sandy.

00:10:36.533 --> 00:10:37.900
I brought you some clothes.

00:10:43.233 --> 00:10:44.233
Thank you.

00:10:45.533 --> 00:10:46.533
Tan.

00:10:47.566 --> 00:10:49.766
We’ve known each other for ten years now,

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:52.266
and you’ve always treated me

00:10:53.433 --> 00:10:55.500
like I’m more than a friend or a sister.

00:10:56.366 --> 00:10:57.700
But we’ve never defined

00:10:59.466 --> 00:11:00.833
our relationship.

00:11:03.066 --> 00:11:07.466
I don’t just want cards expressing your good feelings toward me.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.166
The present I want most from you

00:11:15.666 --> 00:11:18.233
is a clear definition of our relationship.

00:11:42.566 --> 00:11:43.566
Sandy.

00:11:44.466 --> 00:11:45.466
Sandy.

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:49.800
What is it?

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:53.000
I brought you some clothes.

00:11:57.866 --> 00:11:58.866
Thank you.

00:12:24.266 --> 00:12:25.266
Sandy.

00:12:26.333 --> 00:12:28.566
Why couldn’t I reach you?

00:12:28.966 --> 00:12:29.966
Are you all right?

00:12:31.666 --> 00:12:32.666
Sandy!

00:12:39.266 --> 00:12:40.900
- Tan. - Sandy.

00:12:41.966 --> 00:12:43.600
What's wrong?

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.533
Sandy, what's wrong?

00:12:53.133 --> 00:12:54.200
You’re burning up.

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:56.900
Why didn’t you call me? I couldn’t reach you.

00:12:57.633 --> 00:12:59.233
I'm sorry, I...

00:12:59.866 --> 00:13:03.233
I passed out and didn’t know my phone died.

00:13:04.033 --> 00:13:05.033
How about this?

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:07.900
From now on, you need to give me a spare key,

00:13:07.933 --> 00:13:09.733
so I can help if something happens.

00:13:10.333 --> 00:13:11.366
Okay, Tan.

00:13:14.733 --> 00:13:15.733
Take some medicine.

00:13:16.133 --> 00:13:17.133
Here's your water.

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:18.700
Thank you.

00:13:37.233 --> 00:13:38.333
You're burning up.

00:13:40.233 --> 00:13:42.266
You had the medicine, so you’ll be fine.

00:13:44.433 --> 00:13:45.666
Thank you, Tan.

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:47.400
Get some rest.

00:13:48.366 --> 00:13:49.366
I'll help you.

00:13:59.966 --> 00:14:01.466
I’ll sleep outside.

00:14:02.233 --> 00:14:04.666
Call me if you need anything.

00:14:06.433 --> 00:14:07.433
Okay.

00:14:19.033 --> 00:14:20.833
I'm sorry, Sandy.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:22.600
Are you cold?

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:24.900
Come here.

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:40.900
Are you feeling better?

00:14:44.333 --> 00:14:46.033
When I was young and had a fever,

00:14:46.666 --> 00:14:48.166
my mom would hold me like this.

00:14:50.466 --> 00:14:52.433
I’ll keep you company tonight,

00:14:53.066 --> 00:14:55.433
so I can help if you need me to.

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:21.233
Thank you, Tan.

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:28.800
There were many times we had the chance to take things further,

00:15:29.533 --> 00:15:31.900
but it never happened, Aoy and Chod.

00:15:32.866 --> 00:15:34.666
The nicer he is to me,

00:15:35.233 --> 00:15:38.800
the more willing I am to stay stuck in this label-less relationship.

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:50.800
- Tan. - Yes?

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:52.766
Get home safely.

00:16:53.266 --> 00:16:54.266
Okay.

00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:05.100
Sandy.

00:17:13.466 --> 00:17:14.733
I have something to tell you.

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:21.933
I told you that I went drinking and passed out last night,

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:23.400
but actually...

00:17:24.066 --> 00:17:25.066
I...

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:27.566
I was at a party at April’s.

00:17:31.833 --> 00:17:33.466
I had to go because of work.

00:17:34.066 --> 00:17:36.832
I thought it'd be beneficial since there were people from the industry.

00:17:36.833 --> 00:17:37.833
And I...

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:41.533
couldn’t say no to her.

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:46.066
I was going to tell you and invite you,

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:48.700
but you were still mad at me. I didn’t know what to say.

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:50.999
So I thought I’d go briefly,

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.233
but it was really late when I left.

00:17:52.933 --> 00:17:54.766
I'm really sorry, Sandy.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.733
- I'm sorry. - It's okay.

00:18:05.833 --> 00:18:06.833
I understand.

00:18:12.266 --> 00:18:14.300
About April’s photoshoot,

00:18:15.833 --> 00:18:17.700
I think it’s a good opportunity for us.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.799
But if you disagree, I’ll tell her that I refuse...

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:21.866
I’m fine with it.

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:24.833
If you say

00:18:25.533 --> 00:18:27.066
this gig is good for our future,

00:18:28.766 --> 00:18:29.833
I’ll help you.

00:18:30.233 --> 00:18:31.966
I’ll help you the best I can.

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:39.900
Thank you.

00:18:40.333 --> 00:18:41.700
Thank you for understanding.

00:18:46.466 --> 00:18:47.466
I'll get going.

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:49.800
Bye.

00:19:26.866 --> 00:19:28.000
(April)

00:19:30.333 --> 00:19:33.400
(April)

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:36.633
The person you should be paying attention to

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:39.100
is me.

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:41.200
Look at the guests here.

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:44.866
That’s the future waiting for you.

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:47.633
Don’t waste your time.

00:19:47.966 --> 00:19:49.800
A talented photographer like you

00:19:50.633 --> 00:19:52.900
belongs with a well‑connected model

00:19:53.033 --> 00:19:54.033
like me.

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:56.800
Why wait for someone who doesn’t deserve you?

00:20:00.366 --> 00:20:03.600
(April)

00:20:12.333 --> 00:20:13.333
Good morning.

00:20:15.566 --> 00:20:17.933
Yes, April.

00:20:18.966 --> 00:20:20.500
I saw your missed call.

00:20:21.333 --> 00:20:24.500
I was worried and wanted to make sure you got home fine.

00:20:24.866 --> 00:20:26.500
But you probably went to bed, so you turned your phone off.

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:28.100
I didn’t want to bother you.

00:20:28.966 --> 00:20:32.000
You would’ve called me once you woke up.

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:33.900
I...

00:20:34.733 --> 00:20:38.633
April, I want to talk to you about last night.

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:40.100
It's fine.

00:20:40.533 --> 00:20:43.233
Don’t overthink it. It’s nothing.

00:20:44.233 --> 00:20:47.800
I understand if you’re not ready to commit.

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:52.100
If you were, you'd be in a relationship by now.

00:20:52.666 --> 00:20:54.566
I’m fine with you not being in a rush.

00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:56.666
Let me remind you.

00:20:57.666 --> 00:20:59.666
I’m making it clear that I like you.

00:21:00.533 --> 00:21:02.566
I...

00:21:04.666 --> 00:21:07.733
I’ll wait for you to confirm the date for the photoshoot.

00:21:08.666 --> 00:21:09.666
Okay.

00:21:10.133 --> 00:21:12.100
I want to see you as early as possible too.

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:14.600
See you soon.

00:21:16.066 --> 00:21:17.066
Okay.

00:21:29.766 --> 00:21:31.000
Good.

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:33.600
Keep going, April.

00:21:33.733 --> 00:21:35.300
Beautiful.

00:21:35.466 --> 00:21:37.466
Great, keep that pose.

00:21:38.066 --> 00:21:40.966
Okay, that's beautiful. Keep that pose.

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:42.832
Do I look beautiful, Tanwa?

00:21:42.833 --> 00:21:44.233
Yes.

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:45.700
Good.

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:48.033
Just like that.

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:50.333
Let me get a close-up.

00:21:51.033 --> 00:21:52.033
Don't move.

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:53.766
Beautiful. Look down.

00:21:54.366 --> 00:21:55.366
That's it.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.633
Two more shots.

00:21:58.266 --> 00:21:59.266
One.

00:21:59.966 --> 00:22:00.966
Okay.

00:22:02.233 --> 00:22:03.233
One.

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.433
- I'm sorry. - Be careful.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.000
Are you all right?

00:22:07.966 --> 00:22:09.700
I'm fine, but that was close. Thank you.

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:12.933
You should move back a little.

00:22:13.033 --> 00:22:14.033
- Okay. - It's dangerous.

00:22:19.166 --> 00:22:20.933
- I think we got it. - Okay.

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:24.266
- Should we check the photos? - Sure.

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:30.933
Could you please help me?

00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:36.700
Don't worry. I'll take care of you.

00:22:37.666 --> 00:22:39.200
- Please. - Thank you.

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:40.900
But don't bother.

00:22:43.233 --> 00:22:47.433
I already discussed the details with the other client.

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:50.500
Since you wanted more details,

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:53.000
I asked them to recheck everything one more time.

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:56.800
I’ll finalize with them and see you at the other set.

00:22:57.066 --> 00:22:59.500
Thank you. I’ll head there now.

00:23:00.033 --> 00:23:01.033
Sure.

00:23:01.733 --> 00:23:02.966
Let’s move to the other set, everyone.

00:23:03.633 --> 00:23:04.633
Here.

00:23:04.966 --> 00:23:07.333
- Give the thumb drive to Tan. - Sure.

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:08.400
Okay.

00:23:10.033 --> 00:23:11.166
Don’t you want to check the photos, April?

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:15.100
Sure.

00:23:15.766 --> 00:23:18.000
Please wait outside for this set.

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:19.700
Okay.

00:23:35.433 --> 00:23:36.433
Are we ready?

00:23:39.033 --> 00:23:40.033
Yes.

00:23:40.233 --> 00:23:42.300
I’ve asked everyone to wait outside.

00:23:43.133 --> 00:23:45.200
When you’re ready,

00:23:45.566 --> 00:23:47.500
get into the tub and then take off the robe.

00:24:13.633 --> 00:24:14.633
April.

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:16.800
What are you doing?

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.000
Tan.

00:24:23.666 --> 00:24:24.666
Sandy.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.000
I...

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000
I thought you might need help.

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:32.733
April would probably feel more comfortable

00:24:33.233 --> 00:24:34.833
with another woman in the room.

00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:38.700
Shall we start?

00:24:40.933 --> 00:24:43.100
- Let's start. - Okay.

00:24:43.766 --> 00:24:44.966
One, two.

00:24:45.633 --> 00:24:46.633
Good.

00:24:48.366 --> 00:24:49.366
Great.

00:24:49.466 --> 00:24:51.000
You can lift your leg up.

00:24:54.633 --> 00:24:55.833
You seem

00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:57.800
to know Tanwa really well.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.400
Have you known each other for decades?

00:24:59.866 --> 00:25:00.866
That's right.

00:25:00.867 --> 00:25:02.400
I thought you two were a couple,

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:04.200
but Tanwa denied it.

00:25:06.066 --> 00:25:08.300
The longer a woman waits, the fewer chances she gets.

00:25:08.766 --> 00:25:09.766
The older she is,

00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:11.533
the harder it is to find a man.

00:25:12.266 --> 00:25:13.266
Good.

00:25:19.333 --> 00:25:21.300
I'm sorry. Let me fix this.

00:25:30.433 --> 00:25:31.433
Tan.

00:25:32.233 --> 00:25:33.233
April.

00:25:34.466 --> 00:25:35.466
What was that for?

00:25:35.467 --> 00:25:37.500
I didn’t mean to. It was an accident.

00:25:38.066 --> 00:25:39.733
I’m sorry I got you wet.

00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:41.466
It’s okay.

00:25:42.066 --> 00:25:44.300
You can take a shower in my bathroom.

00:25:44.533 --> 00:25:47.100
I can ask my housekeeper to do your laundry.

00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:50.200
Your clothes are in the car.

00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:52.466
Why don’t you get them and go change?

00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:57.400
It's fine. I'll do it.

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:38.366
Hey, April!

00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:40.900
April.

00:27:04.433 --> 00:27:05.433
What are you doing?

00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:06.800
Why are you surprised?

00:27:06.801 --> 00:27:09.500
I just wanted to help, so you’d finish showering faster.

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:14.600
That’s enough, April. Don’t do this.

00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:18.066
I’m begging you. Please don’t do this. Let me go.

00:27:22.066 --> 00:27:23.066
Please.

00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:24.500
Are you sure?

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:26.533
That’s enough. Stop it.

00:27:32.166 --> 00:27:33.300
Are you all right, Tan?

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:36.500
- What is it? - Nothing.

00:27:38.433 --> 00:27:40.433
I came to get the clothes from you.

00:27:41.333 --> 00:27:43.033
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

00:27:43.933 --> 00:27:47.166
Tan, you can tell she did that on purpose, right?

00:27:48.333 --> 00:27:50.233
It doesn’t matter what her intentions are.

00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:51.900
I’m asking you.

00:27:52.466 --> 00:27:55.766
After we’re done with this, can you not work with her anymore?

00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.466
If not, I’ll no longer work with you.

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:05.533
You should go change.

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:22.700
I was just joking around. It wasn't a big deal.

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:59.066
Pack everything, Mod. Don't forget to send me the files.

00:29:01.433 --> 00:29:02.533
Excuse me.

00:29:04.466 --> 00:29:05.533
Are you leaving?

00:29:06.933 --> 00:29:08.266
I wanted to thank you.

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:11.666
I really liked the photos from today.

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:14.600
Thank you. I’ll send you the photos for you to select.

00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:15.900
Okay.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.600
Stay and have dinner.

00:29:19.366 --> 00:29:20.733
You too, Sandy.

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:24.800
It’s okay. I have plans. I’ll get going then.

00:29:25.433 --> 00:29:26.433
Let's go.

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:28.400
Tanwa.

00:29:32.833 --> 00:29:34.266
Stay and have dinner with me.

00:29:35.833 --> 00:29:37.566
I wanted to thank you

00:29:38.133 --> 00:29:39.366
for today’s photoshoot

00:29:39.566 --> 00:29:42.066
and apologize for the inconvenience.

00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:44.800
Sandy.

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:46.500
Tanwa.

00:29:46.766 --> 00:29:48.500
I just wanted to ask you

00:29:49.366 --> 00:29:52.533
if you really see a future with her.

00:29:53.033 --> 00:29:54.333
She seems so young.

00:29:54.466 --> 00:29:57.900
She doesn’t understand what love means to adults.

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:01.200
I don’t want you to waste your time.

00:30:01.466 --> 00:30:02.900
The longer you wait,

00:30:03.533 --> 00:30:04.900
the more time you waste.

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:10.500
I'm sorry, but I have to go. Thank you.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.600
(Tan)

00:30:34.233 --> 00:30:36.200
What’s wrong? Why didn’t you answer my calls?

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:38.500
Please give me my key back.

00:30:38.833 --> 00:30:41.266
From now on, you no longer have the right to come here whenever.

00:30:41.766 --> 00:30:42.766
What's going on?

00:30:43.466 --> 00:30:45.233
Why are you mad at me? I don’t get it.

00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:48.100
We’ve known each other for so long, yet you still don’t understand me?

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:50.333
What's the matter?

00:30:52.466 --> 00:30:54.933
Wait, what's going on?

00:31:05.266 --> 00:31:06.900
We shouldn’t see each other anymore.

00:31:09.433 --> 00:31:11.200
I don’t want to waste any more time.

00:31:12.566 --> 00:31:14.666
What’s going on? What’s the matter with you?

00:31:14.866 --> 00:31:15.866
Good question.

00:31:16.733 --> 00:31:18.066
What am I to you?

00:31:18.866 --> 00:31:21.700
For almost ten years, who am I to you?

00:31:22.833 --> 00:31:23.833
Why...

00:31:24.533 --> 00:31:27.466
Why did you let some woman you’ve just met

00:31:27.966 --> 00:31:29.433
do whatever she wants to you?

00:31:29.966 --> 00:31:31.533
I warned you, but you wouldn’t listen.

00:31:33.766 --> 00:31:35.233
Do you like her?

00:31:36.466 --> 00:31:38.866
Is that why you made me wait on my birthday?

00:31:39.266 --> 00:31:42.366
You wouldn’t tell me where you were or what you were doing.

00:31:45.166 --> 00:31:47.166
Is there more that I don’t know?

00:31:49.233 --> 00:31:51.700
Have you ever cared about my feelings?

00:31:52.466 --> 00:31:53.500
Of course I have.

00:31:53.633 --> 00:31:57.366
Then when are you going to tell me what I am to you?

00:31:57.933 --> 00:32:00.266
Everything I’ve done is obvious.

00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:02.100
That’s not enough.

00:32:03.633 --> 00:32:04.700
What do you want me to do?

00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:07.732
What do you want me to say? You’ve never said anything.

00:32:07.733 --> 00:32:09.733
I also don’t know how you feel.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.733
Why don’t you say it?

00:32:12.766 --> 00:32:15.700
Why don’t you just say it? Just say it!

00:32:22.633 --> 00:32:25.433
You’re an important person to me.

00:32:28.766 --> 00:32:29.766
That’s all?

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:37.800
No other words besides what you’ve written in your birthday cards,

00:32:38.133 --> 00:32:42.066
New Year's or Valentine’s cards that you’ve given me?

00:32:44.433 --> 00:32:47.900
Is there anything more than the beautiful words on these cards?

00:32:54.133 --> 00:32:55.633
Ten years is far too long.

00:32:57.333 --> 00:32:58.800
I can’t wait any longer.

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:16.600
Sandy.

00:33:19.566 --> 00:33:21.700
I’ve always wanted to do that,

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:24.900
and I know you wanted it too.

00:33:25.866 --> 00:33:28.266
I know that

00:33:29.333 --> 00:33:32.033
we’re more than just friends.

00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:39.300
You feel the same way, don’t you?

00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:11.000
It took us a long time

00:35:12.433 --> 00:35:13.833
to get here.

00:35:30.866 --> 00:35:31.933
And...

00:35:33.366 --> 00:35:34.366
right now...

00:35:36.233 --> 00:35:38.100
what are we?

00:35:46.233 --> 00:35:47.866
I’ll get it for you.

00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:53.733
(April)

00:35:59.033 --> 00:36:00.266
Hello, Tanwa.

00:36:00.633 --> 00:36:01.633
What are you doing?

00:36:02.766 --> 00:36:04.266
He’s at my place.

00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:07.433
We’re doing something personal.

00:36:09.333 --> 00:36:10.866
Why are you answering his phone?

00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:15.533
I asked Sandy to answer.

00:36:17.166 --> 00:36:18.766
What is it, April?

00:36:21.333 --> 00:36:24.633
I just wanted to let you know that my birthday’s coming up

00:36:24.866 --> 00:36:26.500
once the photo book is done.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.200
I wanted to throw a party at home to launch the photo book

00:36:30.466 --> 00:36:33.200
and invite you as the photographer.

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:34.966
Would that be okay for you?

00:36:55.433 --> 00:36:59.700
Happy birthday to you

00:37:01.033 --> 00:37:02.533
Happy birthday!

00:37:02.733 --> 00:37:03.900
Happy birthday.

00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:05.900
You're fabulous.

00:37:06.266 --> 00:37:08.100
Bottoms up. Come on.

00:37:08.166 --> 00:37:09.166
Hurry up.

00:37:10.366 --> 00:37:12.866
Make a wish.

00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:14.533
Nice.

00:37:16.333 --> 00:37:18.399
Woo!

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:20.532
I wish you happiness.

00:37:20.533 --> 00:37:21.866
Enjoy, I'll be right back.

00:37:30.233 --> 00:37:31.233
Tan.

00:37:32.833 --> 00:37:33.833
Are you having fun?

00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:35.333
I'm okay.

00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:40.166
Happy birthday.

00:37:51.633 --> 00:37:52.633
Is everything okay?

00:37:53.433 --> 00:37:55.033
- Yes. - What?

00:37:55.066 --> 00:37:56.600
Yes.

00:38:12.633 --> 00:38:13.633
Tan.

00:38:14.766 --> 00:38:17.733
I keep hearing people compliment you.

00:38:18.333 --> 00:38:22.066
They say your work is fabulous.

00:38:22.733 --> 00:38:24.500
- Are you happy? - Really?

00:38:24.733 --> 00:38:26.500
- Of course. - I'm happy.

00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:29.300
I'm so proud of you.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.666
I’ve always known you’re talented.

00:38:31.933 --> 00:38:34.300
I saw your potential back in school.

00:38:35.666 --> 00:38:36.866
I believe

00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:39.633
that you will be very successful,

00:38:40.833 --> 00:38:42.066
just like you’ve always hoped to be.

00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:44.466
Thank you.

00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:51.500
Sandy.

00:38:52.733 --> 00:38:53.733
Excuse me.

00:38:54.433 --> 00:38:56.100
Tanwa, do you have some time?

00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:57.600
Yes.

00:38:58.133 --> 00:39:02.000
Berm from Vogue Magazine wants to talk to you.

00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:04.100
Really?

00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:06.665
Let’s go, Sandy.

00:39:06.666 --> 00:39:10.333
I wanted to ask you something, Sandy.

00:39:10.733 --> 00:39:12.600
It’ll take less than two minutes.

00:39:16.666 --> 00:39:18.233
- Follow me then. - Sure.

00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:20.100
Thank you.

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:22.200
Hello.

00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:27.166
Sandy, I want the polaroid.

00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:28.700
It’s in my bedroom. Can you get it for me?

00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:32.466
I’m sure others are free too.

00:39:32.666 --> 00:39:35.533
They’re all wasted. I don’t want them in my room.

00:39:35.866 --> 00:39:37.533
Could you please help me?

00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:39.366
I don’t just let anyone in.

00:39:40.033 --> 00:39:41.566
Only people I trust,

00:39:42.266 --> 00:39:44.100
or those who’ve already been in.

00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:46.600
Please.

00:40:27.666 --> 00:40:29.300
I don’t just let anyone in.

00:40:29.966 --> 00:40:31.333
Only people I trust,

00:40:32.233 --> 00:40:34.033
or those who’ve already been in.

00:40:54.633 --> 00:40:55.700
Please take care of Tanwa.

00:40:55.766 --> 00:40:58.133
He’s a professional.

00:40:59.533 --> 00:41:03.333
Thank you so much.

00:41:06.566 --> 00:41:07.566
What are these?

00:41:45.933 --> 00:41:48.100
Don’t hold someone back when you don’t love them that much,

00:41:48.333 --> 00:41:50.966
because everyone wants clarity.

00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:55.266
We’re close.

00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:57.666
I just borrowed something from you.

00:41:58.266 --> 00:41:59.733
Do you like

00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:01.500
the new toy I sent you?

00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:03.566
Thank you for inviting me, April.

00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:05.533
Tanwa is my toy.

00:42:05.966 --> 00:42:08.000
I don’t mind sharing him with others.

00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:09.866
How could you do this to me?

00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:13.900
The only one who can build a future for you is me.

00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:16.300
Why are you being so unprofessional?

00:42:16.366 --> 00:42:17.833
Unprofessional?

00:42:18.333 --> 00:42:19.700
We’re not a couple, Sandy.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.300
If you walk away, then we'll no longer see each other.

00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:26.500
Cut.

00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:27.933
That's it.

00:42:28.366 --> 00:42:29.933
- Thank you. - Thank you.

00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:31.200
All right.

00:42:31.466 --> 00:42:33.933
It's so cold.

00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:36.866
What did you say?

00:42:36.966 --> 00:42:38.066
Cut.

00:42:38.333 --> 00:42:39.566
See?

00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:40.600
It's like this.

00:42:40.933 --> 00:42:42.300
Have dinner with me.

00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:52.200
You would make headlines.
