Your Majesty.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.160
You once said

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:01.959
you would not be Emperor Wu,

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:03.680
but one like Emperor Wen and Jing.

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:05.959
A glorious line in history

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.759
is worth less than peace for the people.

00:05:08.399 --> 00:05:09.360
Do you remember?

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.079
Remember.

00:05:14.959 --> 00:05:16.399

Your Majesty.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.360
Rest now.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:32.959

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:35.439

you will come tomorrow, will you not?

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:57.079
I will.

00:06:35.279 --> 00:06:36.079

00:06:40.079 --> 00:06:41.600
Are the preparations ready?

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:45.680
Your Highness,

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:47.639
please think again.

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:50.240
Once the rites are complete,

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.000
Gan Sheng will become
imperial son-in-law.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.360
With the title Prince Wu'an,

00:06:55.879 --> 00:06:57.560
his power will be unshakable.

War spreads,

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.759

His Majesty is still young.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.519
To remove him then

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.240
will be nearly impossible.

00:07:12.319 --> 00:07:13.000
But...

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:14.639
There is still Official Lin.

00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:15.439
And Official Zhang.

00:07:16.199 --> 00:07:16.759
Your Highness.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.000
If we could rethink our plan...

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.090
The Grand Secretary is gone.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:29.720

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:31.839
Xing!

00:07:41.279 --> 00:07:42.279
At this moment,

00:07:43.759 --> 00:07:44.959
there is only one path left.

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:52.439
If we fall, we fall together.

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:53.399
Your Highness.

00:07:56.279 --> 00:07:58.720
We must remove General Gan
before the wedding

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.319
or we lose our last chance.

00:08:01.959 --> 00:08:02.639
Xing.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:04.680
My mind is settled.

00:08:07.279 --> 00:08:08.360
Do not try to stop me.

00:08:27.439 --> 00:08:28.480
Your Highness, wait.

00:08:30.199 --> 00:08:31.680
Must I seek your approval

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:32.960
to see my future husband?

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.159
Move aside.

00:09:17.519 --> 00:09:18.360
General Fuyao.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.130
A pleasure to meet you.

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.279
Why is it you?

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:32.279
You truly care for your daughter.

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:36.440
The moment you heard

00:09:36.919 --> 00:09:38.840
there was a cure for her legs,

00:09:39.879 --> 00:09:41.879
even an anonymous letter

00:09:43.279 --> 00:09:45.039
was enough to draw you here.

00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:47.759
Scholars are sly indeed.

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:50.039
How dare you deceive me!

00:09:53.519 --> 00:09:55.000
General, I deceived no one.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.559
Your daughter was poisoned,

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.879
which is why her legs were crippled

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:02.900
and she can no longer walk properly.

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.440
What nonsense.

00:10:10.799 --> 00:10:12.320
Her injury was an accident.

00:10:16.759 --> 00:10:18.120
An accident?

00:10:21.039 --> 00:10:23.240
Or could it be that someone
planned all of this,

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.360
hoping to bind your loyalty

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:27.639
with a debt of gratitude?

00:10:29.679 --> 00:10:32.639
Your loyalty is sincere, General Fuyao.

00:10:33.279 --> 00:10:35.360
But you treated your enemy as a savior

00:10:36.279 --> 00:10:38.000
and ruined your daughter's life.

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:40.320
How dare you slander the Prince of Wu'an.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.200
You must be courting death.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.519
Kill me if you wish

00:10:43.559 --> 00:10:45.679
and throw away her last chance.

00:10:48.679 --> 00:10:49.720
The evidence is here.

00:10:49.879 --> 00:10:51.039
Right and wrong

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.480
will speak for themselves.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:21.399
Fortunately,

00:11:22.559 --> 00:11:24.480
a poison always has its cure.

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:27.000
This prescription

00:11:27.679 --> 00:11:29.039
