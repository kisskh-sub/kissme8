00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.550
Are you Hioki Asahi?

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:04.010
Huh?

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:05.550
Oh.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.330
Well, you're pretty cute.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.350
Ho.. How... how do you know my name?

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:14.340
You're Naoya's friend, right?

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.330
Naoya?

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.790
Morisaki Naoya.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.430
- Huh?
- Hey.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.520
Get over here.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.220
Hey!

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:24.380
Hey, hey!

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:26.830
Come on, come on.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.490
There were three other high schoolers.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.300
Are you guys friends?

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.010
Yes, we're friends.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.230
Ah, in that case...

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.740
that's too bad.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.089
Huh?

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.080
See, those guys got into a bit of trouble.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.280
Anyway.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.410
Just get in the car.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.050
I... I have to get in?

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:48.370
Hurry up...

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.680
Come on.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.690
Huh? Huh...

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.890
What in the world...

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.640
is going on?

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.960
Is he going to bury me somewhere?

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.500
Um...

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.820
Where are Morisaki and the others...?

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.660
Those guys?

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.800
Don't worry. They're still alive.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.000
"Still" alive... Don't tell
me he's really going to...

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.140
Alright, it's about time we get going.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:35.550
Asahi.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:38.930
Do you have any...

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.110
last words?

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:43.590
L... Last?

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.080
Yeah.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.130
Last words.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.370
It won't open.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.290
So...

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.000
do you have any...

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.510
last words?

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.180
Hm?

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.840
I...

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.520
I want to call...

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.660
my family.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:28.960
What's with you?

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.400
That's adorable.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.100
Huh?

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.130
My family.

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:36.910
- Hioki...
- My family.

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.130
My family.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:43.580
Hioki...

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:44.590
Are you okay?

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:45.920
That must have been scary.

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:48.770
Let's go.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.580
- Huh?
- Hey!

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.430
You okay?

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.800
Sorry, we scared you.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.600
Don't tell me Ryoko-san made you cry.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.200
Ryoko... san.

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.440
By the way, are you guys okay?

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.080
He was just messing with you.

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:05.690
He's my older brother.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.450
How are you feeling now?

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.180
Any...

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.150
last words?

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.230
Huh?

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.530
Can I go home now?

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.000
School Trip: Joined a
Group I’m Not Close to

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.260
I'm really sorry.
Don't be mad, Asahi-kun.

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.060
(Episode 6: Summer Vacation)
I'm not mad.

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:31.520
Sorry about that.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.050
That's just how my brother is.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.780
Come on, forgive me.

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.010
For the rest of the day,
I'll be your driver...

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.030
and your chaperone...

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.150
and I'll take good care of you.

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:42.295
Right, Naoya?

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.450
This guy is our chaperone?

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.130
That makes me even more nervous.

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:47.630
But you were pretty cute, though.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.710
The look on your face
when you were about to cry.

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:52.250
Huh?

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:53.960
Hioki, did you cry?

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.180
No, I didn't cry.

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.230
Are you really okay?

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:03.940
Yeah.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:04.980
I'm fine.

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:07.150
I'm sorry.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.440
For scaring you.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:10.660
What...

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:12.290
What is this...

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.110
sweet atmosphere?

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.130
Thank you...

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:18.490
for not running away.

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:20.390
Yeah.

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.030
Hey!

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:24.780
Hurry up, you two!

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.760
- We're heading to the beach!
- Let's go.

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.040
- Hurry up.
- You're so slow.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.240
Come on.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.860
Let's go, let's go, to the beach!

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.260
Coming, coming, coming, coming!

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.470
Whoa! The ocean!

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:43.250
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.920
Here I come, ocean...

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.820
The ocean~

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.490
- Hey, don't leave me behind!
- You guys are crazy.

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:55.780
Let's go over there.

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:58.940
Hioki, you come too.

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:00.539
Huh? No, thanks. I'll
just watch from here...

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:01.940
- Why not?
- Wait, hold on...

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.030
This is awesome! Whoa~

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.960
- Stop it, don't splash me!
- Nice, nice...

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.120
Naoya, hey!

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:32.630
Being lazy are we? Why be lazy at the
beach!?

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:35.980
Whoa, run for it!

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:41.440
Okay.

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:43.250
Ready...

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:44.319
Set?

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.540
Heave-ho~

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:48.420
What happens to the loser?

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:50.490
- Hey, should there be a penalty?
- Two.

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:52.490
Anyway, the loser gets a penalty.

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:54.070
- Huh?
- One... Go!

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:06.430
Whoa!

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:10.480
Ah, there he is... Hioki.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.560
Over here, over here, wave!

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:15.470
I can't.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.200
- This is heavier than I thought.
- Yeah, it's so heavy.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:21.060
You okay?

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:22.140
- Huh?
- I'll get it.

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:23.210
Sorry.

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.520
- Ah, you okay? It's really heavy.
- Yeah, it is.

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.270
Alright!

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:31.110
Okay, heave-ho.

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:32.770
Here.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.120
Okay, wait.

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:37.560
So... where's Hioki?

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:41.060
Oh, he went over there.

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:44.290
- I'll go check on him.
- Okay.

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:47.350
- Where'd he go?
- Huh... Over there?

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:03.270
Hioki.

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:05.290
What are you doing?

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:08.520
Ta-da!

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:10.770
It's beautiful, right?

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:15.930
Yeah.

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:17.890
It's beautiful.

00:08:18.173 --> 00:08:19.173
Right?

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:22.720
Anyway, let's go.

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:24.880
Everyone's waiting.

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:26.380
Okay.

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:28.010
Hioki.

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:29.270
Hm?

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:31.390
Hey, are you listening?

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:32.660
Mmm...

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:38.570
Huh? What?

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.470
Since you won't listen, I'll
have to carry you by force.

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:43.280
No, don't!

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:44.470
Wait... Ah, stop!

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:45.730
I'm heavy!

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:47.110
Here we go.

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:51.140
- No, no, no, no!
- What are you doing?

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:54.180
What a big baby.

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:55.250
Huh?

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:56.560
So cute... Look this way.

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:00.440
No pictures!

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:08.950
In the end...

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.220
I was carried all the way here.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.560
Ah, thank you.

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:15.260
Are your arms okay?

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:17.880
They might be sore tomorrow.

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:19.880
Sorry.

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:21.110
I'll go on a diet.

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:23.760
Huh?

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:26.766
Does that mean you want
me to carry you again?

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:28.230
No, no, no, that's not what I meant!

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:30.620
Just kidding.

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:41.300
Watarai, you really are...

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:43.190
so kind.

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:46.590
Give it your all... Whoa~

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:49.010
Yay! Awesome, awesome!

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:53.960
Nice.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.240
Let's eat, I wanna eat eat eat.

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:57.550
- So good!
- It's cut perfectly! - Bring it here.

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:00.650
Can I eat it?

00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:01.650
Of course you can.

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:04.590
Go ahead.

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:09.460
Hioki, on the side of your mouth...
you've got something.

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:10.510
Thanks.

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.370
You've got it good, Hioki.

00:10:15.145 --> 00:10:16.416
Having such a devoted die-hard fan by your
side.

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:17.240
(Die-hard fan)

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:18.250
What's that?

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:22.680
It means he only has eyes for Hioki.

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:25.340
(Refuses to Share)
And he refuses to share him.

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:26.860
You really get it.

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:28.950
Yeah, that's great for you.

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:31.340
Mmm... Now he's sulking.

00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:32.990
It's fine.

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:40.640
Come on, let me keep you company.

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:43.490
No, that's okay.

00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:44.460
Huh?

00:10:44.461 --> 00:10:45.950
Don't be shy.

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:47.290
Come on, let's just talk.

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:49.009
Come with me to the convenience store.

00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:52.020
- Convenience store?
- N-No... I'm okay. This is scary, so scary!

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:54.080
Okay, right.

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:55.310
Please let go of me.

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:57.210
Hey, mister...

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:58.690
Why are you holding my hand?

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:07.940
Thank you. I'll take it.

00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:13.440
- I'm back.
- Welcome back.

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:15.100
Here you go.

00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:16.370
It's from Ryoko.

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:17.440
Thanks.

00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:23.270
No problem. It's fine.

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:25.920
Is it good?

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:28.100
- Yeah.
- Here we go.

00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:29.810
Delicious.

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:33.030
You two seem close.

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:34.730
You and Ryoko...

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:37.930
Are you jealous?

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:39.630
No, it's not that.

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:44.170
It's okay to be jealous, you know.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:46.790
Th... that's not what I meant.

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:55.380
Hey~

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.280
Can you film me from over there?

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:58.600
Sure.

00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:06.950
It's not that it bothers me.

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:08.810
It's just...

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:10.450
ever since that day,

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:12.180
every now and then,

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:14.060
I find myself thinking about Watarai.

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:16.610
Hioki.

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:19.240
What do you think about kissing a friend?

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:23.880
Ah.

00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:24.950
Ice cream.

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:27.630
It's melting.

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:29.930
Maybe I should tell him.

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:33.890
But if I say something to him now...

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:37.250
Oh.

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:50.530
Huh?

00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:58.270
Sorry, your ice cream...

00:12:58.990 --> 00:12:59.990
Hmm?

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:01.220
It's fine. Thanks.

00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:40.800
Asahi, do you have a girlfriend?

00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:42.370
Huh? Me?

00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:44.770
- Yep.
- Oh, Hioki doesn't have a girlfriend.

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:46.180
Oh, and by the way,

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:50.109
- He's never had one, either.
- Hey, why are you guys answering for him?

00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:52.710
We've already done
our research on all this.

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:56.480
So you have zero dating experience?

00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:57.860
Don't you have a crush on anyone?

00:13:58.450 --> 00:13:59.950
Huh? No...

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:01.030
What about your type?

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:03.680
I don't really have one.

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:08.090
Well, let's say,

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:10.910
if you were a girl, Asahi,

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:14.320
- Huh?
- If you were a girl,

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:17.350
and you had to pick one of the four,

00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:18.830
who would it be?

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:20.450
What kind of question is that?

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:23.080
- Dude, stop messing around.
- What's the big deal?

00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:25.020
Just give it a thought.

00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:29.280
- Out of these four...
- Yeah.

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:31.520
Imagine it.

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:33.870
If you were going to date one of them,

00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:35.030
what would it be?

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:51.490
Well...

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:53.280
I guess...

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:54.900
I'd...

00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:58.100
Hey there, boys.

00:14:58.700 --> 00:14:59.700
Are you college students?

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:00.700
What are you all up to?

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:03.460
What gives? It's a total sausage fest.

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:06.860
Then again, you're all pretty cute.

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:08.760
Are you celebs?

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:10.630
Or influencers?

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.220
Hey, come hang out with us.

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:15.340
Um, uh...

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:17.880
Excuse me, could you please leave?

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:20.200
They're underage.

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:22.200
Underage, huh?

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:25.840
It's fine if you can't
drink. Just come hang.

00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:29.690
- Yeah!
- Come on, picture time!

00:15:29.715 --> 00:15:31.250
[unintelligible straight man noise]

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:35.000
Please stop.

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:36.910
Huh?

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:38.210
Why?

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.000
Could you please leave?

00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:45.770
Because you're a nuisance.

00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:49.000
What? What did you just say?

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:50.610
You're a pain.

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:52.980
I said get lost.

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:55.700
What's your problem?

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:58.120
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

00:15:58.600 --> 00:15:59.800
What are you doing?

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:02.370
This is getting annoying.

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:04.270
You're causing trouble.

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:07.152
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:11.550
Hioki.

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:13.260
Are you okay?

00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:15.670
I was just startled.

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:17.670
Those guys just...

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:20.380
Oh, wait a sec, that...

00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:25.350
Hioki, is that...?

00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:28.880
- This is definitely alcohol.
- Alcohol?

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:30.290
Who has water?

00:16:30.291 --> 00:16:31.411
Does anyone have some water?

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:33.500
Here.

00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:34.580
Thank you.

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:47.550
Are you okay?

00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:49.460
Feeling any better?

00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:55.090
Mmm... I still feel a little strange.

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.200
Light-headed.

00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:01.610
Maybe you should lie down.

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:04.590
Oh, I'll go get the picnic blanket.

00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:06.490
Wait.

00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:09.520
Stay here.

00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:11.330
Huh?

00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:12.740
Having you here...

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:14.260
makes me happy.

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:19.630
Okay.

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:24.160
It's all right.

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:31.000
I'm sorry.

00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:33.520
I'm always causing you trouble.

00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:36.050
Mmm.

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:37.970
That's not true at all.

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:40.960
Besides, I told you before, didn't I?

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:44.080
You can lean on me when things get tough.

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:48.720
Thank you.

00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:53.670
Then...

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:57.240
- Hmm?
- Just a little more.

00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:01.650
Let me be a little selfish.

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:04.510
Huh?

00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:13.530
Hioki.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000
You're drunk.

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.420
I don't know.

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:18.610
But for some reason,

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:21.760
this feels so comforting.

00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:30.180
Is... is that...

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:34.480
only with me?

00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:37.230
Yeah.

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:39.080
Only you.

00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:50.020
I wonder why.

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:52.500
Is it your scent?

00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:56.680
Your scent...

00:18:57.970 --> 00:18:59.170
is so calming.

00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:04.990
Ah.

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:06.680
I can't.

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:10.690
Ah... I'm so sorry.

00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:12.110
Mmm.

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:13.360
It's okay.

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:14.740
No, that's not it.

00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:19.130
Um...

00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:20.910
Yeah?

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:25.200
I...

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:30.560
feel a little sick.

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:32.200
What?

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:33.630
Sorry.

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:35.189
Water, drink some water.

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:36.190
Oh, sorry. Thanks.

00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:41.310
You okay?

00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:45.830
Yeah.

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:50.730
Watarai.

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:52.020
You're too kind.

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:56.270
Huh?

00:19:58.110 --> 00:19:59.110
Am I?

00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:05.080
You carried me all the way back.

00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:08.210
When I lean on you,

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:10.520
you always hold me steady.

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:15.860
That's because...

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:19.520
it's just for you, Hioki.

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:24.380
Because I'm a die-hard fan.

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:29.310
Mmm.

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:33.780
From now on, if I ever see you in trouble,

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:35.630
I'll come running.

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:39.170
If you want to be selfish,

00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:41.880
I'll always be by your side.

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:44.440
Then,

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:47.970
what if I asked to borrow money?

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:49.780
Huh?

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:53.580
Well, that depends...

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:55.100
on the amount.

00:20:56.530 --> 00:20:57.630
You're supposed to refuse!

00:20:59.450 --> 00:21:00.450
Well...

00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:01.950
But,

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:04.520
if you spoil me too much,

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:06.370
I'll become useless.

00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:13.510
It's okay if you become useless.

00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:17.520
I'll take care of you forever.

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:19.190
What's that supposed to mean?

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:20.520
What are you getting at?

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:25.910
I'll cherish you forever.

00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:32.230
I've always...

00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:33.300
been curious.

00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:35.480
Why Watarai...

00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:36.770
is so...

00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:39.030
good to me.

00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:41.390
But...

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:44.630
deep down...

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:47.710
maybe I've known

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:49.910
the answer all along.

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:55.350
Oh, um...

00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:58.110
Huh?

00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:02.170
Wait... don't tell me...

00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:04.650
right now...

00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:06.340
am I...

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:10.770
being confessed to?

00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:24.010
Yeah.

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:28.970
So that response means...

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.999
Watarai-kun, you...

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.500
I like you.

00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:40.130
I...

00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:43.480
I like Hioki-kun.

00:22:59.100 --> 00:22:59.600
(Next Episode)

00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:02.660
(The Day Their Love Began)
A day so happy I'll never forget it.

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:04.360
Hioki... Asahi.

00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:06.266
(The Truth of That Day)
Can we add one more person?

00:23:06.290 --> 00:23:06.800
That way...

00:23:06.801 --> 00:23:09.210
I can be in the same
group as the person I like.
