(wind whooshing)

00:00:38.206 --> 00:00:43.311
(metal clanging)
(gun firing)

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:57.926
(wind whooshing continues)

00:01:17.312 --> 00:01:21.115
(haunting suspenseful music)

00:01:43.739 --> 00:01:46.407
(cup clacking)

00:01:50.045 --> 00:01:54.248
(people chattering indistinctly)

00:02:02.057 --> 00:02:03.792
- [Secretary] Here
you go, Mr. Claybourne.

00:02:05.761 --> 00:02:06.795
(employees clamoring)

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:08.063
I'm so sorry.

00:02:12.368 --> 00:02:14.403
- No harm done as long
as the ink doesn't smear.

00:02:14.536 --> 00:02:17.706
(employees laughing)

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.744
(employees clapping)

00:02:21.877 --> 00:02:26.081
(people chattering indistinctly)

00:02:36.091 --> 00:02:36.992
- Sir.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.762
Um.

00:02:39.895 --> 00:02:41.563
I just wanted to say
how grateful I am.

00:02:41.697 --> 00:02:44.767
With all the layoffs, I didn't
expect to be here.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.136
- You're young.

00:02:46.268 --> 00:02:47.636
You deserve it.

00:02:50.372 --> 00:02:53.242
- You are destroying
people's lives.

00:02:53.375 --> 00:02:56.345
(security guard speaking
in foreign language)

00:02:56.478 --> 00:02:57.914
- I thought he'd gone.

00:02:58.048 --> 00:03:00.083
- And you can't even
face me, can you?

00:03:00.215 --> 00:03:05.287
(security guard speaking
in foreign language)

00:03:07.824 --> 00:03:09.358
- You got rid of all of us.

00:03:09.491 --> 00:03:11.460
All the old guard.

00:03:11.593 --> 00:03:13.129
- It's not like that.

00:03:13.262 --> 00:03:15.497
- I helped build this
company from nothing.

00:03:15.631 --> 00:03:16.866
It is my life!

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.970
What if I reduce my pay?

00:03:21.104 --> 00:03:22.438
Please, I'm begging you.

00:03:22.571 --> 00:03:25.507
- Why don't we talk about
this later, just us?

00:03:28.978 --> 00:03:30.512
- There won't be a later.
(gun clicking)

00:03:30.647 --> 00:03:31.480
(employees clamoring)

00:03:31.848 --> 00:03:35.685
- Calm down.
Just calm down.

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:36.786
We can talk about it, I promise.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.555
I promise.
- So?

00:03:38.688 --> 00:03:39.421
- Just don't point that at me.
- Stay back, please.

00:03:39.556 --> 00:03:41.024
- You're lying!

00:03:41.157 --> 00:03:42.458
- Just don't point that at me.
- You're lying.

00:03:42.592 --> 00:03:44.160
- Please.

00:03:44.293 --> 00:03:46.963
Stop and just please think
about what you're doing.

00:03:47.097 --> 00:03:49.532
These people,
they're your friends.

00:03:49.666 --> 00:03:50.533
You're married.

00:03:50.667 --> 00:03:51.634
You're married, right?

00:03:51.768 --> 00:03:53.636
So am I.
Okay.

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:55.370
She means everything to me.

00:03:55.505 --> 00:03:56.906
She's a kindergarten
teacher and she loves kids,

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.307
and we're desperate
for one ourselves.

00:03:58.441 --> 00:03:59.676
But she just had a miscarriage,

00:03:59.809 --> 00:04:01.644
which we're gonna
try again and...

00:04:01.778 --> 00:04:05.081
Please, please don't, don't
take that away from her.

00:04:05.215 --> 00:04:08.985
(gun clicking)

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:10.887

(people screaming)

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.690
(Zach gasping)

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.996
(siren howling)

00:04:21.397 --> 00:04:24.334
(people chattering indistinctly)

00:04:24.467 --> 00:04:25.769
- [News Reporter] Good
afternoon, Los Angeles .

00:04:25.902 --> 00:04:27.837
This is weather channel.

00:04:27.971 --> 00:04:28.972
Today, sunshine will give way

00:04:29.106 --> 00:04:30.174
to some rain...
- Oh.

00:04:30.306 --> 00:04:31.708
- as we have some

00:04:31.841 --> 00:04:33.210
cooler weather on the way.
(phone ringing)

00:04:33.343 --> 00:04:35.112
Temperatures are
on the chilly side

00:04:35.246 --> 00:04:39.482
between 50 to 60 degrees.
- Hey, babe, how are you?

00:04:39.616 --> 00:04:41.152
- Yeah, good.

00:04:41.284 --> 00:04:42.719
Just...

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:44.754
I wanna say I'm sorry that

00:04:44.888 --> 00:04:46.389
I didn't call earlier
(siren howling)

00:04:46.523 --> 00:04:47.925
and, you know, just
checking you're okay.

00:04:48.058 --> 00:04:49.526
And you, the car's
still running good.

00:04:49.893 --> 00:04:51.061
And you sure you still
don't want a new one?

00:04:51.195 --> 00:04:52.096
And...

00:04:53.964 --> 00:04:55.065
- Yeah, wait, wait, wait.

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:56.133
Slow down.

00:04:56.466 --> 00:04:58.334
What's wrong?
Are you okay?

00:04:58.468 --> 00:05:00.004
(siren howling)

00:05:00.137 --> 00:05:02.472
- Yeah.

00:05:02.605 --> 00:05:05.308
Yeah, I know I should
have been in touch more

00:05:05.441 --> 00:05:06.844
than I have been.

00:05:08.311 --> 00:05:11.782
I just really need
to see you right now.

00:05:11.916 --> 00:05:13.316
(birds chirping)

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:14.484
- I know, babe.

00:05:14.617 --> 00:05:16.687
But I'll see you tomorrow.

00:05:16.821 --> 00:05:18.588
You're still picking me up
from the airport, right?

00:05:18.722 --> 00:05:20.691
- Yeah, of course.

00:05:20.825 --> 00:05:22.492
Look, I've gotta go.

00:05:22.626 --> 00:05:25.830
But I'll call you later, okay?

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:28.165
I love you.

00:05:28.299 --> 00:05:29.465
- I love you.

00:05:31.735 --> 00:05:34.305
(bird cawing)

00:05:38.242 --> 00:05:40.978
(pensive music)

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:07.404
(people chattering indistinctly)

00:06:13.878 --> 00:06:15.012
- [Julia] What?

00:06:15.146 --> 00:06:16.181
How can you forget me?

00:06:16.314 --> 00:06:17.381
I always wear the same clothes.

00:06:17.514 --> 00:06:19.150
It's my lucky one.

00:06:19.284 --> 00:06:21.752
But, look, I come here
all the time, okay?

00:06:21.886 --> 00:06:22.920
- [Bartender] I'm sorry.

00:06:23.053 --> 00:06:24.155
I've never seen you before.

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:25.689
- Give it to me.

00:06:25.823 --> 00:06:27.225
Just one.

00:06:27.359 --> 00:06:28.659
- [Bartender] You
have to buy a drink.

00:06:28.792 --> 00:06:30.195
- [Julia] I said
I'll buy a drink.

00:06:30.328 --> 00:06:31.495
Why can't you just
give me the olives?

00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:33.198
- [Bartender] It's hotel policy.

00:06:33.331 --> 00:06:34.366
- [Julia] Where?

00:06:34.498 --> 00:06:36.234
Show me.

00:06:36.368 --> 00:06:38.836
Where does it say olives cannot
be eaten without a drink?

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:40.372
- [Bartender] I'm sorry,

00:06:40.504 --> 00:06:41.572
but if you continue
to be obstructive,

00:06:41.705 --> 00:06:42.706
I'll have to ask you to leave.

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.276
- I'm not obstructive.

00:06:44.408 --> 00:06:47.678
I'm not threatening you
or raising my voice.

00:06:47.811 --> 00:06:49.948
No, just give me an olive.
- You have to buy a drink.

00:06:50.081 --> 00:06:52.350
- I'll buy the lady drink.

00:06:55.753 --> 00:06:58.123
Certainly, Mr. Claybourne.

00:06:58.256 --> 00:07:01.059
(bowl clacking)

00:07:01.192 --> 00:07:04.763
- [Waiter] Sir, can
I get anything else?

00:07:04.896 --> 00:07:06.031
- Hi, I'm Julia.

00:07:07.531 --> 00:07:08.432
- Zach.

00:07:11.703 --> 00:07:16.308
- I know it seems odd, but I
could just kill for an olive.

00:07:16.573 --> 00:07:18.576
- Not really my thing.

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:19.711
- No?

00:07:22.681 --> 00:07:23.982
- Very good, sir.

00:07:24.115 --> 00:07:25.917
The Desiree Dubois.

00:07:26.051 --> 00:07:29.453
- It's Dubois. (laughs)

00:07:31.356 --> 00:07:32.891
He'll go far.

00:07:33.024 --> 00:07:34.059
- [Zach] Let's hope
he stays right here.

00:07:34.192 --> 00:07:35.293
(Julia laughing)

00:07:35.428 --> 00:07:37.662
(Zach laughing)

00:07:37.796 --> 00:07:40.433
- [Julia] So, does
work bring you here?

00:07:40.565 --> 00:07:41.466
- Yeah.

00:07:41.599 --> 00:07:43.835
- [Julia] And that is?

00:07:43.969 --> 00:07:44.903
- [Zach] Nothing exciting.

00:07:45.036 --> 00:07:46.805
- Oh, I'm sure it is.

00:07:48.506 --> 00:07:49.474
Tell me.

00:07:51.743 --> 00:07:54.012
- Let's not talk about work.

00:07:55.381 --> 00:07:56.449
Oh, my wife.

00:07:58.116 --> 00:08:00.353
She's on her way over from LA.

00:08:00.485 --> 00:08:02.587
I'm gonna spend a few
days in the Dolomites.

00:08:02.721 --> 00:08:05.324
It's our belated honeymoon.

00:08:05.458 --> 00:08:07.592
- That's very romantic.

00:08:07.726 --> 00:08:11.097
- Yeah, I booked us a
whole deluxe package.

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:12.398
You know, comes with everything.

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:15.633
Spa, hot air balloon
ride, the works.

00:08:15.767 --> 00:08:16.768
- Yeah.

00:08:16.901 --> 00:08:18.837
And does she like olives?

00:08:20.239 --> 00:08:22.041
- No. Why?

00:08:22.174 --> 00:08:24.609
- They say opposites attract.

00:08:27.279 --> 00:08:30.016
(Zach laughing)

00:08:31.683 --> 00:08:34.186
Your trip sounds perfect.

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.687
- Yeah. Thank you.

00:08:37.857 --> 00:08:39.724
We've had a
difficult time, so...

00:08:39.859 --> 00:08:40.792
- Why?

00:08:42.194 --> 00:08:43.528
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:08:47.333 --> 00:08:48.968
- So, what about you?

00:08:49.101 --> 00:08:52.471
- Oh, I'm still searching
for the right person.

00:08:52.805 --> 00:08:54.306
- I meant
what brings you here?

00:08:56.641 --> 00:09:00.212
- Oh, I'm just
waiting for a friend.

00:09:00.346 --> 00:09:01.981
- [Zach] Hmm.

00:09:02.114 --> 00:09:04.050
(Julia laughs)

00:09:04.183 --> 00:09:04.850
- Wow.

00:09:08.921 --> 00:09:12.324
Here's to you having a great
time with your wife tomorrow.

00:09:12.458 --> 00:09:14.427
(glasses clinking)

00:09:16.996 --> 00:09:18.364
- [Julia] Mm.

00:09:18.498 --> 00:09:21.267
(phone buzzing)

00:09:22.668 --> 00:09:23.569
Oh.

00:09:26.038 --> 00:09:27.541
Do you know what?

00:09:29.809 --> 00:09:33.045
It looks like my
friend's not showing.

00:09:35.515 --> 00:09:37.551
(suspenseful music)

00:09:37.683 --> 00:09:41.555
- Look, I don't where
you think this is going.

00:09:43.089 --> 00:09:47.793
- (laughs) That's so
presumptuous of you.

00:09:47.927 --> 00:09:50.029
- I love my wife.

00:09:50.162 --> 00:09:52.631
She means the world to me.

00:09:52.765 --> 00:09:55.569
- Thank you for sharing.

00:09:55.701 --> 00:09:57.270
I'll remember that.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:04.311
(engine rumbling)

00:10:04.444 --> 00:10:07.547
(melancholic music)

00:10:15.021 --> 00:10:17.257
- [Emmy] Why did he do it?

00:10:21.694 --> 00:10:24.164
- I really thought
he was gonna kill me.

00:10:25.731 --> 00:10:27.567
But all I could
think about is you.

00:10:29.369 --> 00:10:31.071
And I told him that.

00:10:33.573 --> 00:10:34.508
- Don't beat yourself up.

00:10:35.609 --> 00:10:36.977
It's not your fault.

00:10:40.313 --> 00:10:41.181
(engine rumbling)

00:10:54.161 --> 00:10:56.763
- I'm really glad you're here.

00:10:56.897 --> 00:10:57.797
- Me too.

00:11:02.669 --> 00:11:04.471
I love my necklace.

00:11:04.605 --> 00:11:06.773
Thank you so much.

00:11:07.908 --> 00:11:09.644
(phone chiming)

00:11:17.751 --> 00:11:20.053
(phone clicking)

00:11:20.187 --> 00:11:21.855
- You'll be able to see

00:11:21.988 --> 00:11:22.856
the Tre Cime on your left
in a moment.

00:11:24.659 --> 00:11:26.460
And in 20 minutes

00:11:26.594 --> 00:11:27.562
(phone chiming)

00:11:27.694 --> 00:11:29.196
we get to Cortina.

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.097
(phone clicking)

00:11:35.336 --> 00:11:38.239
(phone beeping)

00:11:38.372 --> 00:11:39.873
(phone clicking)

00:11:43.009 --> 00:11:44.077
- [Driver] I never get
bored of this view.

00:11:44.212 --> 00:11:45.580
You know?

00:11:45.712 --> 00:11:47.348
- Well, I can see why.

00:11:49.049 --> 00:11:54.821
(phone chiming)

00:11:54.955 --> 00:11:56.856
- You're missing all this, Zach.

00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:59.227
- Huh?

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:00.727
Oh yeah. (laughs)

00:12:01.162 --> 00:12:01.761
- What's that?

00:12:02.862 --> 00:12:04.031
- Oh, no, nothing.

00:12:04.165 --> 00:12:05.533
It's just, you know,

00:12:05.666 --> 00:12:07.435
wrapping up with the deal.

00:12:07.568 --> 00:12:09.503
Boring contract stuff.

00:12:10.471 --> 00:12:12.106
- You gotta relax.

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.274
- Yeah.
Can't you leave work

00:12:13.407 --> 00:12:15.509
for a few days?
- No, no.

00:12:15.643 --> 00:12:17.511
Just let me clear this up
(phone clicking)

00:12:17.645 --> 00:12:22.283
and then I'll be all yours.

00:12:22.416 --> 00:12:23.351
(phone clacking)

00:12:27.888 --> 00:12:28.856
- It's amazing.

00:12:33.661 --> 00:12:36.530
(engine rumbling)

00:12:44.005 --> 00:12:47.108
(birds chirping)

00:12:47.241 --> 00:12:49.977
(cart creaking)

00:12:56.685 --> 00:12:58.419
(door creaking)

00:12:58.553 --> 00:12:59.787
- Here you go.

00:13:01.222 --> 00:13:02.491
Took some persuasion getting

00:13:02.624 --> 00:13:04.593
the chef to agree,
I can tell you.

00:13:08.796 --> 00:13:11.899
(suspenseful music)

00:13:23.412 --> 00:13:24.346
Sir?

00:13:24.479 --> 00:13:27.582
- (gasps) Yeah.

00:13:27.915 --> 00:13:29.351
(pen scratching)

00:13:29.484 --> 00:13:30.319
(pen clacking)

00:13:30.452 --> 00:13:31.952
- Wow. Thank you.

00:13:35.724 --> 00:13:37.693
(door clacking)

00:13:37.825 --> 00:13:42.930
(phone chiming)
(phone buzzing)

00:13:45.933 --> 00:13:49.036
(sinister suspenseful music)

00:13:49.171 --> 00:13:50.672
(phone clacking)

00:13:50.806 --> 00:13:52.541
- Hey, baby.
- Jesus Christ.

00:13:52.674 --> 00:13:54.142
- Jesus.

00:13:54.276 --> 00:13:55.110
- (laughs) Sorry,
I'm switching it off.

00:13:55.243 --> 00:13:56.211
- Good.

00:13:57.813 --> 00:13:58.647
- You're so tense.
- You come first now.

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:00.549
- Thank you.

00:14:00.682 --> 00:14:02.384
You gotta ease off.

00:14:02.517 --> 00:14:03.385
I don't want you having a
heart attack or something.

00:14:05.853 --> 00:14:06.887
Promise?

00:14:07.022 --> 00:14:07.889
- I promise.

00:14:08.924 --> 00:14:09.958
- What do you get me?

00:14:10.092 --> 00:14:12.661
- Well, much to the disgust

00:14:12.794 --> 00:14:14.129
of the Italian people,

00:14:14.262 --> 00:14:16.898
we have pizza de pineapple.

00:14:17.032 --> 00:14:18.133
- No.
- Yeah, I know.

00:14:18.266 --> 00:14:19.301
- Oh.
- Yeah.

00:14:19.434 --> 00:14:20.469
- My favorite.

00:14:20.602 --> 00:14:21.536
- The chef wasn't happy.

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:22.504
- No?

00:14:22.637 --> 00:14:23.672
Thank you.

00:14:23.806 --> 00:14:25.107
How the hell did you swing that?

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:26.308
- Anything for you?

00:14:26.441 --> 00:14:27.376
- Oh, my hero.

00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:29.177
(lips smacking)

00:14:29.311 --> 00:14:30.379
(Emmy and Zach laughing)

00:14:30.512 --> 00:14:31.480
What did you get for yourself?

00:14:33.315 --> 00:14:34.483
- Something that doesn't cause
great offense around here.

00:14:34.616 --> 00:14:35.417
- I'm sorry.

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:37.018
I win.
- Barely

00:14:37.152 --> 00:14:38.186
- Come.

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:41.156
(Emmy chuckling)

00:14:52.067 --> 00:14:54.837
(lips smacking)

00:15:00.142 --> 00:15:01.611
(soft music playing)

00:15:15.924 --> 00:15:18.461
(glass clacking)

00:15:22.398 --> 00:15:25.967
(soft music continues)

00:15:40.216 --> 00:15:41.250
- Zach.

00:15:41.384 --> 00:15:42.485
- What?

00:15:43.952 --> 00:15:45.588
- I don't think

00:15:45.721 --> 00:15:46.656
I'm ready just yet.

00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:55.264
You gotta stop feeling guilty.

00:15:56.966 --> 00:15:59.903
You mustn't blame
yourself, Emmy.

00:16:02.138 --> 00:16:04.307
- I know.

00:16:10.112 --> 00:16:11.581
(lips smacking)

00:16:11.714 --> 00:16:13.182
- [Zach] We'll get there.

00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:20.623
Just take as much
time as you need.

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:29.265
(soft music continues)

00:16:58.529 --> 00:17:01.197
(fire roaring)

00:17:01.331 --> 00:17:02.399
(lever clacking)

00:17:02.533 --> 00:17:04.368
- Hi.

00:17:04.501 --> 00:17:05.903
You ready to see the world as
you've never seen it before?

00:17:06.035 --> 00:17:06.837
Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:08.005
- Zach?
- Yeah.

00:17:08.137 --> 00:17:08.906
- [Harry] Lovely to see you.

00:17:09.038 --> 00:17:09.907
- Emmy.
- Emmy.

00:17:10.039 --> 00:17:10.974
- Nice to meet you.

00:17:11.341 --> 00:17:13.377
- Welcome aboard.
I'm Harry.

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:14.344
- Hi, Harry.

00:17:14.478 --> 00:17:16.078
- Good to see you.

00:17:16.213 --> 00:17:17.881
Trained on the seas, but
destined for the skies. (laughs)

00:17:18.015 --> 00:17:19.750
So, I'll be giving you
a quick safety briefing,

00:17:19.883 --> 00:17:21.385
and then off we'll go.

00:17:21.518 --> 00:17:22.386
No time to lose.

00:17:22.519 --> 00:17:23.587
- Huh, you're American?

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.188
- Yeah. Yeah.

00:17:25.322 --> 00:17:26.890
Born and raised in Chicago.

00:17:27.024 --> 00:17:28.492
Moved out here about 11
years ago with my family.

00:17:28.625 --> 00:17:30.594
Clean air, clean living.

00:17:30.727 --> 00:17:34.231
(lever clacking)
(fire roaring)

00:17:34.364 --> 00:17:35.866
Yeah, time to put the
pedal to the metal.

00:17:35.999 --> 00:17:37.568
My grandson's fifth
birthday's coming up.

00:17:37.701 --> 00:17:39.102
And I'm in the entertainment.

00:17:39.236 --> 00:17:40.170
(Zach laughing)

00:17:40.304 --> 00:17:41.071
I'm a qualified clown.

00:17:41.204 --> 00:17:42.472
- [Emmy] No way

00:17:42.739 --> 00:17:43.774
- From my days in the
circus when I was a kid.

00:17:43.907 --> 00:17:45.409
It's a whole 'nother story,

00:17:45.542 --> 00:17:47.411
but I'm waiting on a
couple of other folks,

00:17:47.544 --> 00:17:52.016
but I guess it might be
us, so safety briefing.

00:17:52.149 --> 00:17:53.051
Okay.

00:17:54.551 --> 00:17:57.754
Ballooning is the safest
mode of air travel

00:17:57.889 --> 00:18:00.557
as long as you follow
a couple of rules.

00:18:00.691 --> 00:18:01.458
You'd be surprised to hear this,

00:18:01.758 --> 00:18:02.459
but some people...

00:18:02.593 --> 00:18:05.295
(engine rumbling)

00:18:09.366 --> 00:18:11.401
Do not smoke or
vape in the basket.

00:18:11.535 --> 00:18:14.772
Do not throw anything
outside of the basket,

00:18:14.906 --> 00:18:18.542
and let me know if you
have any medical conditions

00:18:18.676 --> 00:18:20.577
or if you're pregnant.

00:18:21.378 --> 00:18:22.947
- [Emmy] No.
- [Harry] Okay.

00:18:23.081 --> 00:18:25.415
Okay, then.

00:18:25.549 --> 00:18:26.951
Don't touch any of the
levers or the ropes

00:18:27.085 --> 00:18:28.151
or the instruments.

00:18:28.285 --> 00:18:30.287
I can handle all this myself.

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:31.623
(ominous suspenseful music)

00:18:31.756 --> 00:18:33.625
Oh.
- [Julia] Hey.

00:18:33.758 --> 00:18:35.560
- Your timing is perfect.

00:18:35.693 --> 00:18:37.495
- (laughs) Yeah, it looks
like my friend's not showing.

00:18:37.629 --> 00:18:38.630
Thank you.

00:18:38.763 --> 00:18:41.298
- [Harry] Welcome aboard.

00:18:41.432 --> 00:18:42.399
- [Emmy] Hi, I am Emmy.

00:18:42.533 --> 00:18:44.301
- Hi, I'm Julia.

00:18:44.435 --> 00:18:45.470
- [Harry] Nice to meet you.

00:18:45.903 --> 00:18:47.270
This is my husband, Zach.
- Oh, hi.

00:18:48.271 --> 00:18:49.239
- [Harry] Harry.

00:18:49.374 --> 00:18:50.408
- Nice to meet you.

00:18:50.541 --> 00:18:51.843
- [Harry] Nice to meet you too.

00:18:51.976 --> 00:18:58.316
- Well, (sighs)
sorry for being late.

00:18:58.449 --> 00:18:59.851
So is this a special
occasion for you two?

00:18:59.984 --> 00:19:01.184
- Mm.
- Yeah.

00:19:01.319 --> 00:19:02.987
It's our belated honeymoon.

00:19:03.121 --> 00:19:04.022
(Zach laughing)

00:19:04.154 --> 00:19:06.290
- Oh, that's so sweet.

00:19:06.424 --> 00:19:08.326
I can't think of a better
way to celebrate it

00:19:08.459 --> 00:19:09.427
than up in a balloon.
- Yeah.

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:11.796
- Right?
- Yeah.

00:19:11.929 --> 00:19:13.398
You know what, I'm
not feeling so good.

00:19:13.531 --> 00:19:14.632
I think we should...

00:19:14.766 --> 00:19:15.800
Let's take a rain check on this.

00:19:15.933 --> 00:19:17.201
- [Harry] No worries, Zach.

00:19:17.335 --> 00:19:18.936
I'll look after you.
(Zach laughing)

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:19.837
- We've been looking
forward to this for weeks.

00:19:19.971 --> 00:19:22.440
- Yeah.

00:19:22.573 --> 00:19:23.608
- So I asked my assistant
to book us a private flight.

00:19:23.741 --> 00:19:24.542
I kind of want it to be just us.

00:19:24.676 --> 00:19:25.943
- I know, I know.

00:19:26.078 --> 00:19:28.179
But it's just one
more, it's okay.

00:19:28.312 --> 00:19:29.480
Have you done this before?

00:19:29.614 --> 00:19:30.481
- Oh, yes.

00:19:30.615 --> 00:19:31.449
It's like an obsession.

00:19:31.582 --> 00:19:32.550
- [Emmy] Yeah?

00:19:32.684 --> 00:19:33.718
- You can say that again.

00:19:34.585 --> 00:19:36.187
- Right?

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:37.321
- And I can tell this is
gonna be a crazy good time.

00:19:37.455 --> 00:19:39.857
- Right.
Well, then.

00:19:39.992 --> 00:19:40.993
Mind you, will you just
take that corner, please?

00:19:41.126 --> 00:19:42.226
Zach, you there.

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:44.729
Emmy, come on over here.
- Yeah.

00:19:44.863 --> 00:19:48.466
- [Harry] And now our weight
is perfectly distributed.

00:19:48.599 --> 00:19:49.400
Are you ready?
- Yeah.

00:19:50.334 --> 00:19:51.202
- Let's go.

00:19:52.838 --> 00:19:53.839
- [Emmy] Oh God.

00:19:53.972 --> 00:19:54.840
- [Harry] Let it go, Zach.

00:19:56.875 --> 00:19:57.843
Woohoo.

00:19:57.976 --> 00:19:59.410
- [Emmy] All right.

00:19:59.544 --> 00:20:02.014
(gentle melancholic music)
(Harry laughing)

00:20:02.147 --> 00:20:03.548
- What the fuck
(Harry cheering)

00:20:03.681 --> 00:20:04.549
do you think you're doing?
(flame roaring)

00:20:04.683 --> 00:20:06.151
- You've got your phone.

00:20:06.284 --> 00:20:07.418
Transfer the money now

00:20:07.552 --> 00:20:10.689
and we can all enjoy our flight.

00:20:10.823 --> 00:20:11.589
(Harry laughing)

00:20:12.024 --> 00:20:13.257
- [Emmy] Amazing.

00:20:19.164 --> 00:20:22.067
(birds chirping)

00:20:25.037 --> 00:20:26.071
(flame roaring)

00:20:26.205 --> 00:20:27.072
- [Harry] Never gets old.

00:20:27.206 --> 00:20:28.073
- No?
- No.

00:20:30.709 --> 00:20:31.610
Woo.

00:20:33.479 --> 00:20:34.378
Woo.

00:20:37.049 --> 00:20:39.283
(flame roaring)
(lever clacking)

00:20:39.418 --> 00:20:42.253
(Emmy laughing)

00:20:46.325 --> 00:20:47.226
- Wow.

00:20:55.601 --> 00:21:00.105
(gentle melancholic
music continues)

00:21:13.119 --> 00:21:14.154
(lever clacking)

00:21:14.286 --> 00:21:16.655
- [Harry] Let's get some light.

00:21:22.361 --> 00:21:23.829
- Wow.

00:21:23.962 --> 00:21:24.964
Yeah.

00:21:25.098 --> 00:21:26.431
That's amazing.

00:21:28.234 --> 00:21:29.235
- So cool.

00:21:33.206 --> 00:21:35.841
(wind howling)

00:21:38.878 --> 00:21:40.246
- [Harry] This is Bologna
Indian November Bravo.

00:21:40.379 --> 00:21:42.215
We are in the sky.

00:21:42.347 --> 00:21:43.817
- [Controller] Bolzano
Air Traffic Control,

00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:45.617
flight acknowledged.

00:21:45.751 --> 00:21:47.086
Just be aware of cloud
formation in the east,

00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:47.987
it shouldn't affect you.

00:21:48.121 --> 00:21:49.155
(radio beeping)

00:21:49.289 --> 00:21:50.322
- Reporting all on schedule.

00:21:50.455 --> 00:21:52.058
Everything is tickety-boo.

00:21:52.192 --> 00:21:53.860
- [Controller] Thanks
for the update, out.

00:21:53.993 --> 00:21:56.196
- So you don't
recognize me, do you?

00:21:56.328 --> 00:21:57.429
- Nope.

00:21:57.563 --> 00:21:58.798
Afraid not.

00:21:58.932 --> 00:22:01.600
- [Julia] Okay.

00:22:01.734 --> 00:22:03.435
- Oh, where do you think
you've met my husband?

00:22:03.569 --> 00:22:05.337
- Oh, in Zurich. Just recently.

00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:06.940
- Oh.

00:22:07.073 --> 00:22:08.842
- I think she must
be mistaken. (laughs)

00:22:08.975 --> 00:22:13.213
But I'm sure we can all
get to know each other now.

00:22:13.345 --> 00:22:15.715
- That is an excellent idea.

00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:17.984
Emmy.

00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:19.351
There are some champagne glasses
right here

00:22:19.485 --> 00:22:20.887
- Right.
Okay.

00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:22.555
- If you'll do the honors.

00:22:22.689 --> 00:22:24.958
I have a fast rule.

00:22:25.091 --> 00:22:28.228
I drink champagne
in only two places.

00:22:29.629 --> 00:22:32.632
One, when I'm in
a hot air balloon

00:22:32.765 --> 00:22:33.833
and the other is when I'm not.

00:22:33.967 --> 00:22:36.002
(Harry and Emmy laughing)

00:22:36.135 --> 00:22:37.871
- Here you go?
- Yeah.

00:22:42.876 --> 00:22:43.910
- [Julia] Woo-hoo.

00:22:44.043 --> 00:22:44.878
- Oh.
(cork popping)

00:22:45.011 --> 00:22:45.845
Oh.
- Hey.

00:22:45.979 --> 00:22:49.148
(people laughing)

00:22:49.283 --> 00:22:52.253
- This is voyage number 499.
(champagne babbling)

00:22:52.385 --> 00:22:53.686
But I'm sure this flight's
(glasses clinking)

00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:56.223
gonna be just as
special as the next one.

00:22:56.357 --> 00:22:58.091
Here we are.
Enjoy.

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:01.761
- Cheers.

00:23:02.028 --> 00:23:03.429
(glasses clinking)

00:23:03.563 --> 00:23:06.733
(wind howling)

00:23:06.866 --> 00:23:09.869
(birds chirping)

00:23:10.003 --> 00:23:13.240
- So do you work in Zurich?

00:23:13.374 --> 00:23:14.341
- [Julia] Yeah, I do indeed.

00:23:14.474 --> 00:23:15.342
Yeah.
- Mm.

00:23:15.475 --> 00:23:16.442
And what do you do?

00:23:16.576 --> 00:23:18.411
- Oh, it's kind of boring.

00:23:18.544 --> 00:23:20.546
I hassle people that owe money.

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:22.815
You know, credit control
for a private bank.

00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:25.585
- Well, doesn't
sound boring to me.

00:23:25.718 --> 00:23:27.787
- [Julia] (laughs)
That's very kind.

00:23:27.922 --> 00:23:30.523
But let's not talk about work.

00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:34.962
- Another.

00:23:35.095 --> 00:23:36.529
- [Zach] I shouldn't.

00:23:36.663 --> 00:23:37.764
- Oh, yeah.

00:23:37.898 --> 00:23:39.465
I could never say no.
Can you?

00:23:39.599 --> 00:23:42.702
- Huh?
(glasses clinking)

00:23:45.039 --> 00:23:47.875
- That's Santa Magdalena
where we've just come from.

00:23:48.008 --> 00:23:49.376
Really is amazing, isn't it?

00:23:49.509 --> 00:23:50.476
- Oh, right.
- Thank you.

00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:51.779
- There you go.

00:23:51.912 --> 00:23:52.813
Oops.

00:23:55.382 --> 00:23:56.784
Oh, it's surreal

00:23:58.852 --> 00:24:01.755
- Up here, you really
get to reset who you are.

00:24:01.889 --> 00:24:05.626
- Zach, look at these views.

00:24:05.759 --> 00:24:06.593
- [Harry] You see that
ridge we're heading

00:24:06.727 --> 00:24:07.761
toward over there,

00:24:07.895 --> 00:24:09.596
that's called the Geisler Ridge.

00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:11.065
And since there's no place
to land in the mountains,

00:24:11.198 --> 00:24:12.633
we're gonna turn
around and come back.

00:24:12.766 --> 00:24:15.903
- So you can steer
this thing, like, how?

00:24:16.036 --> 00:24:17.638
- Well, you just
change altitudes,

00:24:17.771 --> 00:24:20.741
wind direction changes
depending on the altitude.

00:24:20.874 --> 00:24:22.309
- Well, that sounds
complicated. (laughs)

00:24:22.444 --> 00:24:25.347
- Well, that's what
makes ballooning unique.

00:24:25.479 --> 00:24:27.915
The journey is the destination.

00:24:28.048 --> 00:24:31.251
You have to surrender
to the elements.

00:24:31.386 --> 00:24:34.922
Flying this way is the quickest
way to escape your problems.

00:24:35.055 --> 00:24:37.825
(wind howling)

00:24:40.728 --> 00:24:41.829
Of course.

00:24:41.962 --> 00:24:44.498
You can't stay up here forever.

00:24:44.631 --> 00:24:45.766
- Have you always done

00:24:45.899 --> 00:24:47.402
this job, Harry?
(lever creaking)

00:24:47.534 --> 00:24:49.803
- Well, I was in the
Navy for a long time.

00:24:49.937 --> 00:24:51.439
Finally retired.

00:24:51.572 --> 00:24:54.008
Wanted to keep busy, so
I ended up in the air,

00:24:54.142 --> 00:24:55.642
and I get paid for this.

00:24:55.776 --> 00:24:58.480
(Julia laughing)

00:25:08.156 --> 00:25:09.224
- Lucky you.

00:25:16.131 --> 00:25:19.700
(Harry singing in German)

00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:26.740
- High school choir.

00:25:26.875 --> 00:25:28.176
You know, up here,

00:25:28.309 --> 00:25:29.878
just got a rear
back and let it rip.

00:25:30.011 --> 00:25:31.678
Sing to the world.

00:25:31.813 --> 00:25:35.483
(Harry singing in German)

00:25:44.259 --> 00:25:48.663
- Woo. Beautiful.
(glass clinking)

00:25:48.797 --> 00:25:50.899
- [Harry] You have a go, Emmy.

00:25:51.032 --> 00:25:51.933
- Okay.

00:25:56.504 --> 00:25:59.340
(Emmy screaming)

00:26:00.675 --> 00:26:04.679
(Emmy laughing)
(Harry laughing)

00:26:04.813 --> 00:26:05.914
- I like that a lot.

00:26:06.247 --> 00:26:07.082
Au naturel.

00:26:08.850 --> 00:26:11.186
(Julia laughing)

00:26:11.319 --> 00:26:14.222
(Julia screaming)

00:26:18.394 --> 00:26:19.294
- Christ.

00:26:20.228 --> 00:26:23.064
(Julia groaning)

00:26:23.865 --> 00:26:25.100
- [Emmy] Okay.

00:26:26.435 --> 00:26:28.036
- That's original.

00:26:29.037 --> 00:26:31.773
(Julia gasping)

00:26:36.010 --> 00:26:37.546
- (laughs) Right.

00:26:37.679 --> 00:26:40.915
(eerie pensive music)

00:26:44.186 --> 00:26:45.421
- Zach, go on.

00:26:48.124 --> 00:26:49.624
- No. (laughs)

00:26:49.757 --> 00:26:50.593
(eerie suspenseful music)

00:26:50.725 --> 00:26:52.261
- [Emmy] I did it.

00:27:11.213 --> 00:27:15.584
(eerie suspenseful
music continues)

00:27:19.421 --> 00:27:20.322
- Whew.

00:27:21.891 --> 00:27:22.791
I'm done.

00:27:22.925 --> 00:27:24.493
- [Harry] Allow me

00:27:25.461 --> 00:27:26.996
- Being so high up.

00:27:27.129 --> 00:27:30.132
It does make you feel
kind of helpless, no?

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.701
- Yes. Yes.

00:27:32.835 --> 00:27:34.503
Certainly gives you a
certain perspective,

00:27:34.637 --> 00:27:37.339
feel you're distant
from everything else.

00:27:37.473 --> 00:27:39.208
Makes you realize what
you really care about.

00:27:39.341 --> 00:27:40.342
- For sure.

00:27:46.949 --> 00:27:48.784
- Would you mind
taking a photo of us?

00:27:48.918 --> 00:27:50.386
- Oh, I wouldn't.

00:27:51.253 --> 00:27:52.321
Let's do it.

00:27:56.825 --> 00:27:57.726
- And, oh no.

00:27:57.860 --> 00:27:59.462
Come on, Zach.
Come on.

00:27:59.596 --> 00:28:00.963
You gotta relax.

00:28:01.096 --> 00:28:03.332
Come on, you look
so tense. (laughs)

00:28:03.466 --> 00:28:06.035
And we don't want that, do we?

00:28:07.437 --> 00:28:09.573
♪ Smile ♪

00:28:10.473 --> 00:28:13.310
(phone clicking)

00:28:18.781 --> 00:28:20.015
Beautiful.

00:28:20.149 --> 00:28:21.817
- [Emmy] Thank you.

00:28:24.853 --> 00:28:26.956
Harry.

00:28:27.156 --> 00:28:28.023
- [Harry] Can I
take a photo of you?

00:28:28.625 --> 00:28:29.925
Oops.

00:28:30.059 --> 00:28:31.194
Oh, looking good.

(Harry laughing)

00:28:32.395 --> 00:28:34.331
One of us?
- Mm.

00:28:34.464 --> 00:28:36.399
Maybe one of us together.

00:28:39.236 --> 00:28:40.503
(wind howling)

00:28:40.637 --> 00:28:42.072
- [Zach] You enjoying this?

00:28:42.205 --> 00:28:43.206
- [Harry] Very nice.

00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:44.708
- More than the other night.

00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:49.212
(phone clicking)

00:28:49.346 --> 00:28:53.550
Hey, Zach, would you please
take a photo of me and Harry.

00:28:59.589 --> 00:29:02.025
I would be ever so grateful.

00:29:06.663 --> 00:29:09.366
(phone clicking)

00:29:09.499 --> 00:29:10.700
- Oh.

00:29:10.834 --> 00:29:12.736
Thank you.
- Thank you.

(wind howling)

00:29:31.622 --> 00:29:32.856
- [Emmy] Harry.

00:29:35.158 --> 00:29:36.393
- [Zach] Hey.

00:29:38.028 --> 00:29:39.095
- Up, up and away.

00:29:39.429 --> 00:29:41.998

Geez.

00:30:17.335 --> 00:30:19.337
Was worried there for a minute?

00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:21.505
- Always in control.

00:30:21.639 --> 00:30:24.007
- Are you?

00:30:24.141 --> 00:30:26.210
- Well, yeah, if you
know what you're doing,

00:30:26.344 --> 00:30:27.611
you can handle things
pretty quickly.

00:30:27.745 --> 00:30:29.547
- Yeah.

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:33.184
And that can get you out of
awkward situations, I imagine.

00:30:33.317 --> 00:30:34.819
- [Harry] Exactly.

00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:42.159
- You need to take
care of this, and soon.

00:30:42.293 --> 00:30:43.294
- Take care of what?

00:30:50.501 --> 00:30:52.403
- I think if you show your hand,

00:30:52.536 --> 00:30:54.071
you're gonna lose your hand.

00:30:54.205 --> 00:30:56.040
- I'm really confused.

00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:59.210
What are you talking about?

00:30:59.343 --> 00:31:00.978
I'm not following.

00:31:03.514 --> 00:31:06.083
- Friends, let's
try to relax a bit.

00:31:06.217 --> 00:31:08.085
Things are getting
a little tense.

00:31:08.219 --> 00:31:11.389
Why don't you just
enjoy this air?

00:31:11.522 --> 00:31:14.191
Absolutely devoid of pollution.

00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:17.395
- What, Zach?

00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:19.964
(wings fluttering)

00:31:20.965 --> 00:31:21.733
(eagle cawing)

00:31:21.867 --> 00:31:22.768
- Whoa.

00:31:23.968 --> 00:31:26.170
A golden eagle.

00:31:26.303 --> 00:31:28.172
(laughs) That's incredible.

00:31:28.305 --> 00:31:29.741
You hardly ever see them.

00:31:29.875 --> 00:31:31.442
You're very lucky.

00:31:33.978 --> 00:31:35.946
- Okay, turn the balloon 'round.

00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:37.248
- It's understandable
to be a bit nervous

00:31:37.381 --> 00:31:39.016
if you're not an
experienced flyer.

00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:40.251
- No, no, no.

00:31:40.384 --> 00:31:41.352
I said turn the balloon 'round.

00:31:41.486 --> 00:31:42.554
- [Harry] It's not that simple.

00:31:42.687 --> 00:31:43.522
- I don't care.

00:31:43.655 --> 00:31:45.122
Make it happen.

00:31:45.256 --> 00:31:46.625
- You obviously have
something to discuss,

00:31:46.758 --> 00:31:49.126
but you may not do it here.

00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:52.564
I will return you
safely in half an hour.

00:31:52.697 --> 00:31:54.231
We are in the middle
of the mountains.

00:31:54.366 --> 00:31:56.902
It's impossible to land.
(wind howling)

00:31:57.034 --> 00:31:59.937
We need to ride
the currents back.

00:32:03.909 --> 00:32:06.143
- Are you gonna play ball?

00:32:07.178 --> 00:32:09.980
(Zach laughing)

00:32:10.114 --> 00:32:11.483
- I'm not following.

00:32:11.616 --> 00:32:13.318
- Yeah, 'cause she's
not making any sense.

00:32:13.452 --> 00:32:14.653
- So you don't remember me.

00:32:14.786 --> 00:32:16.053
- No.
- Really?

00:32:16.188 --> 00:32:17.988
- No? Look at me.

00:32:18.123 --> 00:32:19.957
You don't remember
buying me a drink?

00:32:20.091 --> 00:32:21.760
- [Zach] I buy lots
of people drinks.

00:32:21.893 --> 00:32:22.761
- (laughs) What?

00:32:22.894 --> 00:32:24.129
Expensive champagne.

00:32:24.262 --> 00:32:25.130
Desiree Dubois?

00:32:25.263 --> 00:32:28.300
(Zach laughing)

00:32:28.433 --> 00:32:29.734
Well, maybe all his
girls look the same

00:32:29.868 --> 00:32:31.436
after a few glasses of bubbly.

00:32:31.570 --> 00:32:32.337
- Yeah.

00:32:32.604 --> 00:32:33.572
- Is that what it is?

00:32:33.705 --> 00:32:36.775
(Julia laughing)

00:32:36.908 --> 00:32:40.245
Look, your husband thinks
he can take advantage of me

00:32:40.378 --> 00:32:42.747
and do whatever he wants
without any consequences.

00:32:42.882 --> 00:32:43.815
Well, no.

00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:45.083
- Really?

00:32:45.217 --> 00:32:46.017
What are you actually saying?

00:32:46.151 --> 00:32:47.185
- Oh my God, Emmy.

00:32:47.319 --> 00:32:48.653
Don't even bother. (laughs)

00:32:48.787 --> 00:32:50.622
- You don't know
anything, do you?

00:32:50.755 --> 00:32:54.159
Well, that's so weird because
I know all about you, Emmy.

00:32:54.292 --> 00:32:55.093
- Oh, you do?

00:32:55.227 --> 00:32:57.596
- Yeah.
- Oh.

00:32:57.729 --> 00:32:58.597
- I know things have
cooled off between you two

00:32:58.731 --> 00:32:59.866
since you lost the baby.

00:32:59.998 --> 00:33:01.801
- Oh, shit.

00:33:01.934 --> 00:33:03.668
Look, I must have gone out
and had a few drinks, okay?

00:33:03.803 --> 00:33:06.204
- [Emmy] So you did
have drinks with her?

00:33:06.338 --> 00:33:07.840
- I wouldn't have said
anything that personal.

00:33:07.974 --> 00:33:08.808
- No?
Probably just the things

00:33:08.941 --> 00:33:10.375
have been a bit

00:33:10.509 --> 00:33:11.376
difficult for her.
- That you don't want sex.

00:33:12.010 --> 00:33:13.478
- Okay. Well that's bullshit.

00:33:13.613 --> 00:33:15.113
- That's rich.
- Emmy. Okay.

00:33:15.247 --> 00:33:16.147
- Why would you

00:33:16.281 --> 00:33:17.516
even share that...
- Emmy.

00:33:17.650 --> 00:33:18.885
- with the complete stranger?

00:33:19.017 --> 00:33:19.819
- No, I wasn't a
complete stranger.

00:33:19.952 --> 00:33:21.119
Tell her, was I?

00:33:21.687 --> 00:33:22.522
He slept with me.

00:33:22.922 --> 00:33:24.322
- Okay.
Well, that's a lie.

00:33:24.657 --> 00:33:25.558
- Is it?
- She's lying.

00:33:25.691 --> 00:33:26.993
- No, she's lying.
- Is it?

00:33:27.125 --> 00:33:28.661
Is it a lie?
- Emmy, she's lying.

00:33:28.794 --> 00:33:29.795
- Then how would I know
about this birthmark?

00:33:29.929 --> 00:33:30.796
- Fuck. Don't fucking touch me.

00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:31.998
- So it's true.

00:33:32.130 --> 00:33:33.900
- Oh, Emmy, come on.

00:33:34.032 --> 00:33:34.834
What? What?

00:33:34.967 --> 00:33:35.768
Hang on.

00:33:35.902 --> 00:33:37.068
You actually believe her.

00:33:37.202 --> 00:33:38.236
Look at her.
- Please.

00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:40.138
Will you all just calm down.

00:33:40.272 --> 00:33:41.374
I can't believe this is the
way I'm spending the day.

00:33:41.507 --> 00:33:42.742
- Okay, you can stay the fuck

00:33:42.875 --> 00:33:44.209
outta this.
- Stop shouting at him.

00:33:44.343 --> 00:33:45.076
- No, don't.
- Listen to me, please.

00:33:45.210 --> 00:33:46.044
Okay, look.

00:33:46.177 --> 00:33:47.480
Just look at me, Emmy.

00:33:48.681 --> 00:33:49.549
Look at me.

00:33:49.682 --> 00:33:50.483
I'm not lying, okay?

00:33:50.616 --> 00:33:51.384
I swear.

00:33:51.517 --> 00:33:52.585
- Why is she here?

00:33:52.718 --> 00:33:53.586
- Because she knows who I am.

00:33:53.719 --> 00:33:55.021
And she wants money.

00:33:55.153 --> 00:33:56.054
All right. She's
trying to blackmail me.

00:33:56.187 --> 00:33:57.723
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:33:57.857 --> 00:33:59.325
- [Emmy] So why didn't
you just tell me that.

00:33:59.458 --> 00:34:00.359
- [Zach] I wasn't gonna
take it seriously, Emmy?

00:34:00.493 --> 00:34:01.394
She's fucking insane.

00:34:01.527 --> 00:34:02.728
- When did all this happen?

00:34:02.862 --> 00:34:03.996
- Oh, God, I don't...

00:34:04.129 --> 00:34:05.898
A couple of nights ago.

00:34:06.032 --> 00:34:08.200
I bought her a drink 'cause
the bartender gave her shit.

00:34:08.334 --> 00:34:10.269
- So she made all this
effort to come on this trip

00:34:10.403 --> 00:34:12.605
and blackmail you for that?
- I know.

00:34:12.738 --> 00:34:14.106
Yeah.
- That makes no sense.

00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:15.541
- Exactly.

00:34:15.675 --> 00:34:17.109
- And we had one
drink, one drink.

00:34:17.243 --> 00:34:18.277
- No, it was more than that.
- That's all.

00:34:18.411 --> 00:34:19.245
Okay, maybe a couple of drinks.

00:34:19.378 --> 00:34:20.212
- I don't know.

00:34:20.346 --> 00:34:21.747
- I thought it was

00:34:21.881 --> 00:34:22.748
a champagne bottle.
- Oh, for fuck...

00:34:22.882 --> 00:34:23.749
I don't remember, okay.

00:34:23.883 --> 00:34:24.717
I had a shitty day.

00:34:25.384 --> 00:34:26.686
- Right.

00:34:27.086 --> 00:34:28.055
Okay, so why didn't you
just tell me about this,

00:34:28.187 --> 00:34:29.088
and how the fuck does she know

00:34:29.221 --> 00:34:30.057
about your birthmark?

00:34:30.823 --> 00:34:31.959
- Social media.

00:34:32.091 --> 00:34:32.926
Okay.

00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:33.961
There's a photo...

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:35.094
Everyone's got social media.

00:34:35.227 --> 00:34:36.162
Photos of us in Hawaii.

00:34:36.295 --> 00:34:37.129
She probably saw it there,

00:34:37.263 --> 00:34:38.598
You can see that

00:34:38.731 --> 00:34:39.866
in all of them.
- I don't do social media.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:40.800
- You don't?
What are you

00:34:40.934 --> 00:34:41.801
talking about?

00:34:42.201 --> 00:34:43.402
- Of course you don't.
Okay.

00:34:43.536 --> 00:34:45.072
Emmy, that's enough.

00:34:45.204 --> 00:34:46.105
Okay, why are we even
arguing about it.

00:34:46.238 --> 00:34:47.074
- Don't touch me.

00:34:48.909 --> 00:34:50.376
- [Julia] You should have
just paid the money, Zach.

00:34:50.509 --> 00:34:51.912
- Well, you think just
because I'm nice enough

00:34:52.045 --> 00:34:53.479
to buy you a drink
that you can come

00:34:53.613 --> 00:34:55.114
and blackmail me

00:34:55.247 --> 00:34:56.148
with some bullshit accusation?
(sensor beeping)

00:34:56.549 --> 00:34:58.451
- [Julia] Bullshit?
Really?

00:34:58.584 --> 00:34:59.619
- I mean, if I had
anything to hide,

00:34:59.753 --> 00:35:00.553
I would've just paid you, right?

00:35:00.687 --> 00:35:01.487
But I didn't.

00:35:01.621 --> 00:35:02.956
So I'm really sorry.

00:35:03.090 --> 00:35:04.091
I think your little
game is over.

00:35:04.223 --> 00:35:05.726
- Well, I don't think so.

00:35:06.059 --> 00:35:07.060
What are you doing?

00:35:07.193 --> 00:35:08.629
- Opening a vent,

00:35:08.762 --> 00:35:09.663
we're getting too high.
- No, stop. Stop.

00:35:12.431 --> 00:35:13.265
I said don't touch it.

00:35:13.399 --> 00:35:15.769
(wind howling)

00:35:15.902 --> 00:35:18.672
You, you're not
getting away with this.

00:35:18.805 --> 00:35:19.606
- Mayday, mayday.
(radio crackling)

00:35:20.007 --> 00:35:20.974
(knife clanging)

00:35:21.108 --> 00:35:22.308
- Dammit, lady.

00:35:22.442 --> 00:35:23.677
What the hell are you doing?

00:35:24.077 --> 00:35:25.078
- [Julia] Well, we don't
need a radio, right?

00:35:25.211 --> 00:35:26.747
If we escaped from our problems.

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:27.914
- [Harry] The only
problem we have right now

00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:29.116
is getting this balloon lower.

00:35:29.248 --> 00:35:30.017
All right?

00:35:30.149 --> 00:35:31.150
I don't do that.

00:35:31.283 --> 00:35:32.119
We're gonna run outta oxygen,

00:35:32.251 --> 00:35:33.520
pass out and die.

00:35:35.756 --> 00:35:36.690
- Okay. Listen.

00:35:36.823 --> 00:35:37.824
You've made your point.

00:35:37.958 --> 00:35:39.191
Please.

00:35:39.326 --> 00:35:40.627
You're putting our
lives in danger.

00:35:40.761 --> 00:35:43.463
Can you just let
Harry fly the balloon?

00:35:45.832 --> 00:35:46.867
- No. Stop.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:47.701
(dramatic music crescendos)

00:35:48.101 --> 00:35:48.902
(Julia screaming)

00:35:49.403 --> 00:35:52.839
(Zach and Harry groaning)

00:35:55.876 --> 00:35:56.877
(wind roaring)

00:35:57.010 --> 00:35:57.911
- [Emmy] Stop this.

00:35:58.045 --> 00:35:58.812
- [Harry] I can't.

00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:01.615
- Are you alright?
- Yeah.

00:36:01.748 --> 00:36:04.152
(Julia coughing)

00:36:04.785 --> 00:36:07.621
(Julia and Zach groaning)

00:36:12.492 --> 00:36:15.462
(Julia groaning)

00:36:19.566 --> 00:36:21.969
(metal clanging)

00:36:22.369 --> 00:36:23.737
(gas whooshing)

00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:26.007
(Julia groaning)

00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:27.240
(Zach groaning)

00:36:27.374 --> 00:36:30.277
(flame roaring)

00:36:31.745 --> 00:36:34.748
(Julia screaming)

00:36:39.519 --> 00:36:42.156
- [Emmy] Take your jacket off.

00:36:44.192 --> 00:36:45.425
Wait, help her.

00:36:45.559 --> 00:36:46.593
(Julia groaning)

00:36:46.728 --> 00:36:50.230
(extinguisher whooshing)

00:36:55.636 --> 00:37:01.709
(Julia groaning)
(Emmy coughing)

00:37:01.843 --> 00:37:07.247
(Julia groaning)
(Emmy coughing)

00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:09.784
(wind howling)

00:37:09.917 --> 00:37:15.123
(Julia groaning)
(Emmy coughing)

00:37:23.231 --> 00:37:24.098
- [Zach] Oh my God.

00:37:24.232 --> 00:37:25.800
What has she done?

00:37:33.074 --> 00:37:36.010
- We're still rising.

00:37:36.144 --> 00:37:38.646
- I need the rope
to open the vent.

00:37:40.948 --> 00:37:41.916
And now it's out of reach.

00:37:42.049 --> 00:37:43.050
(Julia coughing)

00:37:43.185 --> 00:37:44.051
- [Zach] What does that mean?

00:37:44.186 --> 00:37:45.319
We can't get to it?

00:37:50.925 --> 00:37:52.426
- Steady. Steady.

00:37:54.896 --> 00:37:55.997
Okay?

00:37:56.131 --> 00:37:57.331
- Yeah.

00:37:57.465 --> 00:37:58.332
- You're gonna be okay.

00:37:58.466 --> 00:37:59.300
(Julia groaning)

00:37:59.433 --> 00:38:00.501
- Thank you.

00:38:06.108 --> 00:38:09.011
(basket creaking)

00:38:09.978 --> 00:38:11.312
- [Emmy] Harry.

00:38:12.613 --> 00:38:13.748
What are you...

00:38:15.117 --> 00:38:17.685
(wind howling)

00:38:17.819 --> 00:38:21.290
(Harry whistling)

00:38:21.422 --> 00:38:22.657
Harry?

00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:23.624
- All right.

00:38:24.993 --> 00:38:27.963
(Julia groaning)

00:38:28.797 --> 00:38:32.000
(Harry groaning)

00:38:32.134 --> 00:38:33.135
It's too...

00:38:37.973 --> 00:38:40.676
(wind howling)

00:38:43.611 --> 00:38:46.447
(Julia groaning)

00:39:00.295 --> 00:39:02.664
(Harry gasping)

00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:05.834
- [Emmy] You got it?

00:39:05.968 --> 00:39:07.069
- [Harry] Okay.

00:39:07.202 --> 00:39:08.136
Going.

00:39:10.439 --> 00:39:13.075
(wind roaring)

00:39:18.046 --> 00:39:19.781
- [Emmy] It's working.

00:39:19.915 --> 00:39:23.018
(balloon roaring)

00:39:24.953 --> 00:39:27.756
(Julia groaning)

00:39:29.625 --> 00:39:35.265
(balloon roaring)
(basket creaking)

00:39:35.397 --> 00:39:36.199
- [Harry] Come on.

00:39:36.531 --> 00:39:37.499
(Julia groaning)

00:39:37.633 --> 00:39:38.400
- [Emmy] Be careful.

00:39:38.533 --> 00:39:39.335
- No.

00:39:40.136 --> 00:39:40.903
No.

00:39:42.338 --> 00:39:45.241
(Harry screaming)

00:39:50.046 --> 00:39:52.681

00:39:57.719 --> 00:39:59.755
(birds chirping)

00:40:00.056 --> 00:40:02.959
(body thudding)
(flesh squelching)

00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:14.871
(wind howling)

00:40:15.004 --> 00:40:16.940
- What the fuck?

00:40:17.073 --> 00:40:18.074
- It was an accident.

00:40:18.207 --> 00:40:19.275
- You fucking killed him.

00:40:19.409 --> 00:40:20.709
- [Julia] It was an accident.

00:40:20.843 --> 00:40:22.045
- Oh, my God.
- I didn't mean to.

00:40:22.178 --> 00:40:23.712
- [Zach] Bullshit, bullshit.

00:40:23.846 --> 00:40:26.049
We both watched you.
- No, no.

00:40:26.182 --> 00:40:27.116
I didn't mean to.

00:40:27.250 --> 00:40:28.084
- We both saw you do it.

00:40:28.217 --> 00:40:29.152
We...

00:40:29.285 --> 00:40:30.887
- I didn't mean it.

00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:33.790
(wind howling)

00:40:35.758 --> 00:40:38.261
(Julia gasping)

00:40:38.394 --> 00:40:41.230
(sensor beeping)

00:40:43.232 --> 00:40:45.068
- [Zach] Oh, my God.

00:40:46.703 --> 00:40:49.339
(wind howling)

00:40:50.907 --> 00:40:55.078
(frantic suspenseful music)

00:40:55.445 --> 00:40:57.981
(Zach speaking indistinctly)

00:40:58.348 --> 00:41:00.750
- [Zach] If we keep going
up, we are all gonna die.

00:41:00.883 --> 00:41:03.319
- [Julia] (laughs) Good.

00:41:03.454 --> 00:41:04.354
Good.

00:41:05.555 --> 00:41:06.556
(Emmy gasping)

00:41:06.689 --> 00:41:09.592
(wind howling)

00:41:14.063 --> 00:41:15.531
- [Zach] She's collapsed, Emmy.

00:41:15.665 --> 00:41:16.699
- [Emmy] Yeah.

00:41:16.833 --> 00:41:19.002
- [Zach] What's happening?

00:41:19.135 --> 00:41:21.170
- [Emmy] We have to
get to that rope.

00:41:21.305 --> 00:41:23.940
(wind howling)

00:41:33.583 --> 00:41:34.485
Wait.

00:41:36.652 --> 00:41:39.323
- [Zach] Emmy,
what are you doing?

00:41:39.456 --> 00:41:40.823
(Zach speaking indistinctly)

00:41:40.957 --> 00:41:43.659
(zip buzzing)

00:41:48.631 --> 00:41:50.833
- We gotta tie this on.

00:41:52.436 --> 00:41:53.370
- [Zach] No.

00:41:53.504 --> 00:41:54.405
Don't.

00:41:54.537 --> 00:41:56.106
Please, it's not safe.

00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:57.640
(Emmy groaning)

00:41:57.774 --> 00:41:59.609
- [Emmy] Jesus Christ.

00:42:04.647 --> 00:42:07.683
(suspenseful music)

00:42:08.785 --> 00:42:11.388
(Emmy gasping)

(metal clanging)

00:42:18.796 --> 00:42:21.031
(wind howling)

00:42:21.165 --> 00:42:22.166
- [Zach] Hang on, Emmy.

00:42:22.299 --> 00:42:23.834
I'm right behind you.

00:42:23.967 --> 00:42:26.703
(body thudding)

00:42:29.673 --> 00:42:32.409
(Emmy groaning)

00:42:35.746 --> 00:42:38.449
(Emmy groaning)

(wind howling)

00:42:49.193 --> 00:42:51.895
(Emmy groaning)

00:43:28.366 --> 00:43:31.102
(Emmy groaning)

00:43:33.605 --> 00:43:36.640
(suspenseful music)

00:43:38.876 --> 00:43:41.678
(metal clanging)

00:43:50.889 --> 00:43:53.690
(basket creaking)

00:43:58.296 --> 00:43:59.497
(Emmy groaning)

00:43:59.631 --> 00:44:03.535
(suspenseful music crescendos)

00:44:06.104 --> 00:44:08.773
(wind howling)

00:44:11.643 --> 00:44:14.312
(Emmy gasping)

00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:31.396
(Emmy groaning)

00:44:31.530 --> 00:44:35.466
(suspenseful music crescendos)

00:44:42.675 --> 00:44:45.343
(wind howling)

00:44:56.721 --> 00:44:59.358
(Emmy gasping)

00:45:15.073 --> 00:45:16.908
(wind howling)

00:45:17.209 --> 00:45:18.410
- Got it, Zach.

00:45:18.544 --> 00:45:20.546
Look, I got the rope.

00:45:20.679 --> 00:45:22.181
We're going down.

00:45:24.216 --> 00:45:25.117
Zach.

00:45:27.086 --> 00:45:27.885
Zach.

00:45:28.853 --> 00:45:30.122
Zach!

00:45:30.256 --> 00:45:31.090
Zach!

00:45:31.923 --> 00:45:33.292
- Wake up.
Zach.

00:45:33.425 --> 00:45:34.759
Oh, God.

00:45:34.892 --> 00:45:36.629
(Emmy gasping)

00:45:36.761 --> 00:45:38.063
- [Zach] What the fuck.

00:45:38.197 --> 00:45:40.865
(Emmy gasping)

00:45:58.284 --> 00:46:00.720
- It looks pretty flat
where we're headed.

00:46:00.853 --> 00:46:02.288
I think.,,

00:46:02.421 --> 00:46:03.757
I think we might get
carried all the way

00:46:03.889 --> 00:46:06.392
across the mountains
to the fields.

00:46:06.525 --> 00:46:08.762
Maybe we just let it land.

00:46:10.062 --> 00:46:11.665
Let me just close the vent

00:46:11.797 --> 00:46:15.067
just before so we
don't fall as quick.

00:46:16.770 --> 00:46:19.773
- [Zach] We should
tie her up, right?

00:46:19.905 --> 00:46:21.073
And gag her.

00:46:22.207 --> 00:46:23.643
- [Emmy] Why?

00:46:23.777 --> 00:46:26.111
So she's can't talk
about what happened.

00:46:26.245 --> 00:46:28.615
- No, 'cause she's dangerous.

00:46:28.748 --> 00:46:31.283
(Zach groaning)

00:46:31.417 --> 00:46:34.086
(rope buzzing)

00:46:38.458 --> 00:46:41.193
(Zach groaning)

00:46:44.431 --> 00:46:46.932
(wind howling)

00:46:48.802 --> 00:46:50.637
What else is in here?

00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:57.377
(Julia screaming)

00:47:05.251 --> 00:47:07.886
(Zach gasping)

00:47:25.839 --> 00:47:28.575
(wind howling)

00:47:37.617 --> 00:47:38.518
Hey.

00:47:41.054 --> 00:47:41.988
Okay.

00:47:46.359 --> 00:47:49.028
I really didn't sleep with her.

00:47:51.564 --> 00:47:52.899
- [Emmy] What about
your birthmark?

00:47:53.032 --> 00:47:54.501
How did she know
about your birthmark?

00:47:54.634 --> 00:47:56.202
- I don't know, photos
on social media.

00:47:56.336 --> 00:47:57.370
- [Emmy] She doesn't
use social media.

00:47:57.504 --> 00:47:59.172
- Oh God. Seriously?

00:47:59.305 --> 00:48:00.273
Emmy, look.

00:48:01.574 --> 00:48:02.442
Okay.

00:48:02.575 --> 00:48:03.878
We went out for drinks.

00:48:04.010 --> 00:48:05.979
She came on to me,
but that was it.

00:48:06.112 --> 00:48:07.080
Okay?

00:48:08.716 --> 00:48:12.887
I really dunno how else
to prove it to you.

00:48:13.019 --> 00:48:14.053
- [Emmy] Show me that
social media post.

00:48:14.187 --> 00:48:15.756
You know, where you can see it?

00:48:15.890 --> 00:48:17.591
I mean, you'd have to
be practically naked.

00:48:17.725 --> 00:48:19.125
- I can't right now.
I don't have service.

00:48:19.259 --> 00:48:22.395
- [Emmy] Well,
that's convenient.

00:48:22.530 --> 00:48:23.930
- You know what?

00:48:25.331 --> 00:48:28.234
I got 'em saved
on my phone, here.

00:48:31.337 --> 00:48:32.305
There.

00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:33.340
See?

00:48:37.578 --> 00:48:40.246
(Zach gasping)

00:48:51.859 --> 00:48:52.959
- Yeah.

00:48:53.092 --> 00:48:54.060
I do wanna believe you, Zach.

00:48:54.195 --> 00:48:56.230
- Look, I need you, Emmy.

00:48:58.199 --> 00:49:00.301
Okay, I can't imagine
the world without you

00:49:00.434 --> 00:49:03.404
and the family that
we're gonna have.

00:49:03.537 --> 00:49:05.506
And when we get home,

00:49:05.639 --> 00:49:08.242
I'm gonna get you the
best fertility doctor

00:49:08.375 --> 00:49:10.010
that money can buy.

00:49:11.111 --> 00:49:12.112
Huh?

00:49:13.914 --> 00:49:14.748
- Yeah.
- All right.

00:49:14.882 --> 00:49:15.783
Good.

00:49:18.919 --> 00:49:19.854
Well, that doesn't look good.

00:49:19.987 --> 00:49:21.388
(wind howling)

00:49:21.655 --> 00:49:25.359
(ominous suspenseful music)

00:49:37.404 --> 00:49:39.106
We're gonna crash.

00:49:40.241 --> 00:49:42.676
Well, what would we do?

00:49:42.811 --> 00:49:45.679
- Wait, this is closed.

00:49:45.814 --> 00:49:47.615
We gotta change directions.

00:49:47.749 --> 00:49:50.251
- Well, how are we gonna do
that when these don't work.

00:49:50.384 --> 00:49:52.520
- We get lighter.

00:49:52.654 --> 00:49:54.488
- We should throw her out.

00:49:54.623 --> 00:49:55.489
- No.

00:49:55.624 --> 00:49:56.691
Come on.

00:49:57.759 --> 00:49:59.661
Let's throw these out.

00:50:01.428 --> 00:50:04.799
(Zach groaning)
(canister whooshing)

00:50:04.933 --> 00:50:07.401
Okay. I think that's working.

00:50:08.970 --> 00:50:09.905
Yeah.

00:50:10.037 --> 00:50:11.706
Yeah.
Okay, good.

00:50:13.307 --> 00:50:15.510
- [Zach] Let's
take this one too.

00:50:15.644 --> 00:50:18.212
(Zach groaning)

00:50:18.345 --> 00:50:21.081
(Emmy groaning)

00:50:24.386 --> 00:50:25.654
Right, next.

00:50:25.787 --> 00:50:26.588
Come on.

00:50:27.556 --> 00:50:28.523
Hey, watch out.

00:50:28.657 --> 00:50:30.926
(wind howling)

00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:41.269
(Zach groaning)

00:50:46.508 --> 00:50:48.577
- [Emmy] Jesus.

00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:49.711
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:50:49.844 --> 00:50:51.446
Maybe we should leave one.

00:50:51.580 --> 00:50:53.214
We might need it later.

00:50:53.348 --> 00:50:55.350
- There's not gonna be a
later unless we clear that.

00:50:55.483 --> 00:50:58.186
(wind howling)

00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:06.127
(gasps) Oh, shit.

00:51:06.261 --> 00:51:07.128
- [Emmy] what do we do?

00:51:07.262 --> 00:51:08.129
- [Zach] Hold on tight.

00:51:08.263 --> 00:51:09.564
We're gonna hit it.

00:51:11.866 --> 00:51:15.236
(balloon rustling)

00:51:15.370 --> 00:51:17.572
(Emmy groaning)

00:51:17.706 --> 00:51:18.607
Oh shit.

00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:19.641
Hold on.

00:51:24.145 --> 00:51:26.882
(Julia groaning)

00:51:27.016 --> 00:51:28.951
(Emmy gasping)

00:51:29.085 --> 00:51:31.988
(balloon rustling)

00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:34.924
(wind howling)

00:51:42.130 --> 00:51:43.131
- Jesus.

00:51:45.635 --> 00:51:48.470
(wind whooshing)

00:51:57.479 --> 00:52:00.148
(Emmy gasping)

00:52:05.721 --> 00:52:08.691
(balloon rustling)

00:52:12.128 --> 00:52:14.797
(Julia groaning)

00:52:18.567 --> 00:52:21.202
(wind howling)

00:52:23.673 --> 00:52:26.342
(Emmy gasping)

00:52:32.281 --> 00:52:35.317
(Julia groaning)

00:52:36.652 --> 00:52:37.553
Come on.

00:52:44.460 --> 00:52:45.327
- I don't know
(Julia coughing)

00:52:45.461 --> 00:52:46.696
why you targeted me.

00:52:46.829 --> 00:52:49.532
There were other
guys at the hotel.

00:52:51.434 --> 00:52:52.635
- You think you
can come over here

00:52:52.768 --> 00:52:53.636
and do what you like?

00:52:54.837 --> 00:52:56.006
Is that what you think?
Huh?

00:52:56.139 --> 00:52:57.174
- Stop it. Both of you.

00:52:57.306 --> 00:52:59.009
(Julia coughing)

00:52:59.142 --> 00:53:01.510
(wind howling)

00:53:01.644 --> 00:53:02.979
- What the hell

00:53:05.481 --> 00:53:08.384
(Julia groaning)

00:53:11.855 --> 00:53:14.523
(wind howling)

00:53:22.999 --> 00:53:26.837
(ominous suspenseful music)

00:53:31.574 --> 00:53:32.776
Is this okay.

00:53:34.745 --> 00:53:36.680
- [Emmy] I don't know.

00:53:38.014 --> 00:53:40.684
(wind howling)

00:53:57.333 --> 00:54:01.071
(ominous suspenseful music)

00:54:10.213 --> 00:54:13.049
(wind whooshing)

00:54:14.618 --> 00:54:17.454
(Julia sniffing)

00:54:30.567 --> 00:54:32.302
- You have no idea.
Have you?

00:54:34.871 --> 00:54:36.274
- I have money.

00:54:36.406 --> 00:54:38.075
So do lots of guys.

00:54:44.282 --> 00:54:46.616
(Julia sighs)

00:54:46.750 --> 00:54:49.287
(knife clacking)

00:54:51.255 --> 00:54:52.156
So, go on.

00:54:52.290 --> 00:54:53.991
Why did you target me?

00:54:57.394 --> 00:55:00.363
- You killed my
father, Hans Fischer.

00:55:02.799 --> 00:55:04.035
He was my dad.

00:55:05.468 --> 00:55:07.470
- That's the man
who took his life?

00:55:07.604 --> 00:55:09.539
- He worked for
Krieger for 40 years.

00:55:09.673 --> 00:55:10.942
It was his life.

00:55:15.246 --> 00:55:16.714
But you just didn't
care. Did you?

00:55:16.848 --> 00:55:18.282
- Of course I did.

00:55:18.415 --> 00:55:19.851
It was a business
decision, all right?

00:55:19.984 --> 00:55:21.618
One that meant the
company could survive

00:55:21.752 --> 00:55:23.486
and hundreds of employees
could keep their jobs.

00:55:23.620 --> 00:55:24.621
- But not that.

00:55:24.755 --> 00:55:26.523
Just a worthless piece of shit

00:55:26.657 --> 00:55:28.659
begging not to be flushed away.

00:55:28.793 --> 00:55:31.394
- He had a great payout,
retirement ahead of him,

00:55:31.528 --> 00:55:32.495
but he chose to end it all.

00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:33.898
Not me.

00:55:34.031 --> 00:55:35.333
- My father was
everything to me.

00:55:35.465 --> 00:55:37.535
He was the only person
I could talk to.

00:55:37.668 --> 00:55:39.337
And he was the only
person who cared for me

00:55:39.469 --> 00:55:42.874
when I couldn't cope
with all of this.

00:55:43.007 --> 00:55:45.176
But what do you understand?

00:55:45.309 --> 00:55:46.409
You understand nothing,

00:55:46.544 --> 00:55:48.145
you entitled piece of shit

00:55:48.279 --> 00:55:52.483
with your designer suits
and your initialed socks.

00:55:53.684 --> 00:55:56.254
You know I read up on you.

00:55:56.387 --> 00:55:58.357
You inherited all the money.

00:55:58.489 --> 00:55:59.991
You haven't even earned
it, you a piece of shit.

00:56:00.124 --> 00:56:00.992
Huh?

00:56:01.125 --> 00:56:01.926
- You're fucking crazy.

00:56:02.059 --> 00:56:03.060
- I am not crazy.

00:56:03.494 --> 00:56:04.896
- You are. You're fucking crazy.

00:56:05.029 --> 00:56:05.897
- I am not crazy. (screams)
(knife squelching)

00:56:06.030 --> 00:56:07.698
(Emmy speaking indistinctly)

00:56:08.599 --> 00:56:10.167
- I'm not crazy.

00:56:10.302 --> 00:56:11.102
- Julia stop, please.
- She stabbed me.

00:56:11.903 --> 00:56:13.204
- I'm not crazy.

00:56:13.338 --> 00:56:14.171
- I'm sorry what
happened to your father?

00:56:14.306 --> 00:56:15.172
We both are.

00:56:15.307 --> 00:56:16.173
We truly are. Nobody's

00:56:16.308 --> 00:56:17.074
saying you're crazy.

00:56:17.209 --> 00:56:18.210
We can help you.

00:56:18.343 --> 00:56:19.410
We can say it was an accident.

00:56:19.543 --> 00:56:20.511
- No, it wasn't.
- What happened.

00:56:20.645 --> 00:56:21.445
Shut up, Zach.

00:56:22.381 --> 00:56:24.283
Listen.
Listen.

00:56:24.415 --> 00:56:25.549
We can take care of all this.

00:56:25.683 --> 00:56:26.617
We can take care

00:56:26.751 --> 00:56:27.752
of all this.
- Yeah.

00:56:27.885 --> 00:56:29.587
Please, please, listen.

00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:32.357
Listen. Calm down.

00:56:32.490 --> 00:56:34.092
- There is no
taking care of this.

00:56:34.226 --> 00:56:35.793
Now my dad is gone.

00:56:35.927 --> 00:56:37.296
I've got nothing left to lose.

00:56:37.428 --> 00:56:38.363
- Julia. Julia.

00:56:38.496 --> 00:56:39.231
- It's over.

00:56:39.563 --> 00:56:40.332
- Julia. Julia.

00:56:40.631 --> 00:56:41.899
Stop, please.
Please, please.

00:56:42.034 --> 00:56:43.634
No, no, no.
Please. stop,

00:56:43.768 --> 00:56:45.569
Stop, please.
Don't.

00:56:47.872 --> 00:56:50.708
- [Julia] I can't
do this anymore.

00:56:50.841 --> 00:56:52.110
- It's gonna be okay.

00:56:52.244 --> 00:56:54.645
Please, let me help you.

00:56:54.779 --> 00:56:56.547
Just give me the knife.

00:56:56.681 --> 00:56:58.817
Julia, just give me the knife.

00:56:58.951 --> 00:57:02.421
I promise you, everything
will be all right.

00:57:02.553 --> 00:57:06.224
- I'm sorry for you, Emmy.

00:57:06.358 --> 00:57:07.591
You never should have
married this piece of shit.

00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:10.628
(Zach screaming)
(canister thudding)

00:57:10.762 --> 00:57:13.464
(Zach groaning)

00:57:15.701 --> 00:57:17.601
- What the fuck, Zach?

00:57:20.739 --> 00:57:22.240
(Julia gasping)

00:57:22.374 --> 00:57:24.276
- Zach, what the fuck?

00:57:28.246 --> 00:57:30.983
(Julia gasping)

00:57:32.818 --> 00:57:34.820
- I was protecting you.

00:57:37.823 --> 00:57:40.525
(Zach groaning)

00:57:43.762 --> 00:57:46.598
(wind whooshing)

00:57:53.071 --> 00:57:55.974
(Emmy whimpering)

00:58:01.447 --> 00:58:02.415
- Emmy.

00:58:09.988 --> 00:58:10.856
- Are you okay?

00:58:11.757 --> 00:58:13.658
Let me see. Let me see.

00:58:15.060 --> 00:58:17.796
(Zach groaning)

00:58:19.831 --> 00:58:20.866
- Do something?

00:58:20.999 --> 00:58:21.700
Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right.

00:58:21.833 --> 00:58:22.701
Wait, hold it.

00:58:22.834 --> 00:58:23.702
Hold it. Hold it.

00:58:23.835 --> 00:58:24.870
Hold it. Here, hold it.

00:58:25.003 --> 00:58:27.407
Oh, shit.
(Zach groaning)

00:58:27.539 --> 00:58:30.542
- Oh god. (groans)

00:58:33.312 --> 00:58:34.480
Emmy.

00:58:37.450 --> 00:58:38.650
- It's okay.

00:58:38.784 --> 00:58:39.551
- Could you hurry up?

00:58:39.684 --> 00:58:41.154
- I've got this.

00:58:41.287 --> 00:58:42.088
(Zach groaning)

00:58:42.221 --> 00:58:43.056
- Coming.

00:58:44.057 --> 00:58:45.824
Here, here.
Put this...

00:58:45.958 --> 00:58:47.592
Hold this. Hold this.
Press down.

00:58:47.726 --> 00:58:50.562
(Zach screaming)

00:58:51.630 --> 00:58:54.200
(Emmy gasping)

00:59:03.575 --> 00:59:04.510
- Oh God.

00:59:06.746 --> 00:59:08.281
- Okay.

00:59:08.414 --> 00:59:09.115
Sorry.

00:59:09.515 --> 00:59:10.883
Just hold this up.

00:59:11.818 --> 00:59:13.219
What else to do?

00:59:16.222 --> 00:59:19.792
(eerie suspenseful music)

00:59:26.365 --> 00:59:29.902
I think she was gonna
gimme the knife?

00:59:30.036 --> 00:59:32.772
- [Zach] I had to put you first.

00:59:37.076 --> 00:59:42.215
(wind howling)
(metal clanging)

00:59:47.253 --> 00:59:52.925
- (exhales) I just
want all this to end.

00:59:53.059 --> 00:59:55.262
(wind howling)

01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:08.908
(cloth tearing)

01:00:10.910 --> 01:00:13.646
(Emmy groaning)

01:00:17.217 --> 01:00:18.452
(metal clanging)

01:00:18.585 --> 01:00:20.320
It's getting bigger.

01:00:21.221 --> 01:00:23.957
(Zach groaning)

01:00:34.001 --> 01:00:35.701
We're being pushed
into those mountains.

01:00:35.835 --> 01:00:38.138
- We need to do something.

01:00:38.272 --> 01:00:39.173
- I know.

01:00:41.308 --> 01:00:44.111
(wind howling)

01:00:50.317 --> 01:00:52.819
Can we get these
burners working again?

01:00:52.953 --> 01:00:55.622
(wind howling)

01:01:02.362 --> 01:01:03.297
Oh, shit.

01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:04.231
They're not connected.

01:01:04.364 --> 01:01:05.766
- [Zach] Oh, God.

01:01:11.539 --> 01:01:13.473
(Emmy groaning)

01:01:13.608 --> 01:01:14.676
- Oh, shit.

01:01:14.808 --> 01:01:17.645
(wind howling)

01:01:19.846 --> 01:01:20.747
Yes.

01:01:23.317 --> 01:01:24.084
Oh, shit.

01:01:31.559 --> 01:01:34.828
- Emmy, we're losing
height real fast.

01:01:38.165 --> 01:01:41.835
(tense suspenseful music)

01:01:43.705 --> 01:01:45.939
- Why is it not working?

01:01:50.978 --> 01:01:53.080
Oh, pilot light's out.

01:01:53.214 --> 01:01:54.148
- What?

01:01:54.282 --> 01:01:57.352
(switch clicking)

01:02:02.156 --> 01:02:03.725
Have you got any other ideas?

01:02:03.857 --> 01:02:05.859
- No. Do you?

01:02:05.993 --> 01:02:08.296
- We should throw her out.

01:02:08.429 --> 01:02:09.564
- What?

01:02:09.697 --> 01:02:10.964
- She's dead.
- Really?

01:02:11.099 --> 01:02:13.767
- What the fuck does it matter?

01:02:15.103 --> 01:02:17.405
Also, she's freaking me out.

01:02:21.875 --> 01:02:23.945
(lighter clicking)

01:02:24.078 --> 01:02:25.580
- Here. Try that.

01:02:26.847 --> 01:02:28.616
(Zach groaning)
- Fuck.

01:02:33.588 --> 01:02:36.324
(Zach groaning)

01:02:38.726 --> 01:02:40.595
(wind whooshing)

01:02:40.729 --> 01:02:41.629
- Wait.

01:02:41.764 --> 01:02:43.131
You gotta turn this on

01:02:43.264 --> 01:02:44.666
at the same time.
(lighter clicking)

01:02:44.799 --> 01:02:46.267
(flame whooshing)

01:02:46.401 --> 01:02:48.236
- Yeah, that's got it.
- Yeah.

01:02:48.369 --> 01:02:50.305
(flame roaring)

01:02:50.438 --> 01:02:54.008
(tense suspenseful music)

01:02:57.312 --> 01:02:59.314
(wind howling)

01:02:59.447 --> 01:03:00.749
- [Zach] Again?

01:03:01.583 --> 01:03:03.585
(flame roaring)
- [Emmy] Yep.

01:03:08.089 --> 01:03:10.492
(Emmy sighing)

01:03:10.626 --> 01:03:11.493
Yeah.

01:03:15.664 --> 01:03:18.333
- [Zach] It's working.
- [Emmy] Yeah.

01:03:18.467 --> 01:03:21.135
(wind howling)

01:03:27.108 --> 01:03:29.944
(tense suspenseful music)

01:03:30.078 --> 01:03:30.945
- Oh no.

01:03:31.079 --> 01:03:32.880
That ridge is too high.

01:03:35.517 --> 01:03:37.820
We need to get even lighter.

01:03:37.952 --> 01:03:39.655
Throw it all out.

01:03:39.788 --> 01:03:40.789
(wind howling)

01:03:40.922 --> 01:03:44.393
(Emmy and Zach groaning)

01:03:48.197 --> 01:03:51.367
(object whooshing)

01:03:52.267 --> 01:03:54.869
(Emmy gasping)

01:04:01.210 --> 01:04:03.412
- We need to lose height.

01:04:03.545 --> 01:04:04.413
There's another wind
current down there.

01:04:04.546 --> 01:04:06.048
We need to catch it.

01:04:06.181 --> 01:04:07.182
- What?

01:04:07.316 --> 01:04:08.384
- We need to catch it.

01:04:08.517 --> 01:04:09.818
There's another wind current.

01:04:09.952 --> 01:04:11.186
(lever clacking)

01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:13.989
(wind howling)

01:04:17.459 --> 01:04:19.428
(Emmy groaning)

01:04:19.561 --> 01:04:21.330
(wind howling)

01:04:21.463 --> 01:04:24.199
(Emmy groaning)

01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:41.350
- Zach, we're getting too close.

01:04:45.053 --> 01:04:47.724
(wind howling)

01:04:52.928 --> 01:04:55.565
(Emmy gasping)

01:05:00.537 --> 01:05:03.907
(tense suspenseful
music crescendos)

01:05:04.039 --> 01:05:06.709
(wind howling)

01:05:12.449 --> 01:05:15.117
(Emmy gasping)

01:05:16.619 --> 01:05:19.288
(wind howling)

01:05:24.294 --> 01:05:26.830
(Emmy gasping)

01:05:59.329 --> 01:06:00.763
Can you help me?

01:06:07.403 --> 01:06:10.139
(Zach groaning)

01:06:17.647 --> 01:06:20.116
- (groans) Fuck.

01:06:20.250 --> 01:06:23.052
(Zach groaning)

01:06:24.687 --> 01:06:27.190
(wind howling)

01:06:30.593 --> 01:06:33.998
- I can't believe she's dead.

01:06:34.130 --> 01:06:36.000
- Well, it's not my fault.

01:06:36.132 --> 01:06:37.433
Self-defense.

01:06:42.505 --> 01:06:43.540
- I know it's not your fault.

01:06:43.674 --> 01:06:46.175
I'm not saying it's your fault.

01:06:46.309 --> 01:06:47.210
I'm...

01:06:52.115 --> 01:06:53.416
Saying none of this
would've happened

01:06:53.551 --> 01:06:56.419
if you hadn't bought
her her drink.

01:06:56.554 --> 01:06:57.588
- What?

01:06:57.721 --> 01:06:59.490
If I hadn't bought her a drink?

01:06:59.623 --> 01:07:03.761
So this is my fault because
I bought someone a drink?

01:07:03.894 --> 01:07:05.763
Are you trying to
blame this all on me?

01:07:05.896 --> 01:07:08.164
- No.

01:07:08.298 --> 01:07:09.567
- Do you have any idea
what it's been like

01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:10.834
living with you the
last six months?

01:07:10.968 --> 01:07:11.835
I've had to...
- Listen.

01:07:11.969 --> 01:07:12.937
- practically forced you

01:07:13.069 --> 01:07:14.371
just to come out with me.

01:07:14.505 --> 01:07:16.006
- Yeah.
- You know why don't go out?

01:07:16.139 --> 01:07:18.008
Are you fucking kidding?
- When I go for one drink,

01:07:18.141 --> 01:07:19.175
and then all this happens.
- I've got a reason for that.

01:07:19.310 --> 01:07:20.344
- It's not my fucking fault.

01:07:20.477 --> 01:07:21.445
- Do think it's just normal that

01:07:21.579 --> 01:07:22.846
you just go out for drinks

01:07:22.980 --> 01:07:24.014
with a random woman.
- You have no idea.

01:07:24.147 --> 01:07:24.949
Fuck you.

01:07:26.517 --> 01:07:27.952
- Fuck you, Emmy.
- Fuck you, you fucking...

01:07:28.084 --> 01:07:29.620
- Fuck you.
(Emmy screaming)

01:07:34.358 --> 01:07:36.427
- Zach!
- Here.

01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:37.428
- [Emmy] Zach.

01:07:37.828 --> 01:07:41.231
(Zach groaning)

01:07:41.365 --> 01:07:43.133
(Emmy groaning)
(Zach gasping)

01:07:43.267 --> 01:07:44.201
(Emmy screaming)
(board snapping)

01:07:44.335 --> 01:07:44.969
- [Zach] Emmy.

01:07:50.174 --> 01:07:50.942
Emmy.

01:07:51.709 --> 01:07:54.478
(Emmy groaning)

01:07:55.245 --> 01:07:56.780
(Emmy screaming)

01:07:56.915 --> 01:07:58.582
(Emmy groaning)
(Zach groaning)

01:07:58.716 --> 01:08:00.284
(rope whooshing)

01:08:00.417 --> 01:08:01.452
Emmy.

01:08:01.585 --> 01:08:03.253
It's gonna break.

01:08:03.554 --> 01:08:04.488
(Emmy screaming)

01:08:04.622 --> 01:08:06.190
Take this.
- Zach.

01:08:06.323 --> 01:08:07.826
(board creaking)
(Emmy screaming)

01:08:07.959 --> 01:08:08.827
- Emmy.

01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:11.495
(wind howling)

01:08:11.629 --> 01:08:13.297
- [Emmy] Zach.

01:08:13.430 --> 01:08:15.834
(Zach groaning)

01:08:17.601 --> 01:08:20.504
(wind roaring)

01:08:20.638 --> 01:08:22.841
(Emmy screaming)

01:08:22.974 --> 01:08:25.677
(Zach groaning)

01:08:26.577 --> 01:08:28.579
- (groans) Zach.

01:08:30.447 --> 01:08:32.083
(Emmy gasping)

01:08:32.216 --> 01:08:34.586
(Zach groaning)

01:08:34.719 --> 01:08:35.620
(rope creaking)

01:08:35.754 --> 01:08:38.590
(wind howling)

01:08:42.426 --> 01:08:44.428
(Zach groaning)

01:08:44.562 --> 01:08:47.297
(Emmy groaning)

01:08:48.399 --> 01:08:50.835
(wood creaking)

01:08:50.969 --> 01:08:53.705
(Zach groaning)

01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:05.984
(Zach and Emmy groaning)

01:09:15.860 --> 01:09:16.861
- Oh, fuck.

01:09:18.630 --> 01:09:22.134
(Emmy and Zach groaning)

01:09:24.269 --> 01:09:26.905
(Zach gasping)

01:09:31.876 --> 01:09:33.011
You're okay.

01:09:33.145 --> 01:09:34.345
You're okay.

01:09:34.479 --> 01:09:37.149
(Zach gasping)

01:09:43.221 --> 01:09:44.589
- Where you...

01:09:44.723 --> 01:09:46.691
Where you not gonna help me?

01:09:46.825 --> 01:09:47.726
- What?

01:09:50.829 --> 01:09:53.231
- When you hesitated like...

01:09:54.299 --> 01:09:55.266
- Oh.

01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:56.367
- Like you weren't gonna help me

01:09:56.501 --> 01:09:58.037
- God no.
No, Emmy.

01:09:58.170 --> 01:10:01.006
I was in shock.

01:10:02.842 --> 01:10:04.009
I'm sorry I said
those things to you.

01:10:04.143 --> 01:10:06.746
It was just frustration.

01:10:06.879 --> 01:10:07.880
That's all.

01:10:09.247 --> 01:10:10.615
I said you could trust me.

01:10:10.750 --> 01:10:12.617
You can trust me.

01:10:12.752 --> 01:10:15.054
Okay, I'll always
be there for you.

01:10:15.187 --> 01:10:16.055
All right? Always.

01:10:16.188 --> 01:10:18.858
(Emmy gasping)

01:10:21.694 --> 01:10:22.595
Hey.

01:10:25.831 --> 01:10:30.703
(tense suspenseful music)

01:10:41.413 --> 01:10:44.315
(thunder roaring)

01:10:47.553 --> 01:10:50.256
(wind howling)

01:10:55.394 --> 01:10:58.063
(wind howling)

01:11:13.412 --> 01:11:14.847
(thunder roaring)

01:11:14.980 --> 01:11:17.150
- We're picking up speed.

01:11:18.951 --> 01:11:21.687
(flame roaring)

01:11:28.928 --> 01:11:31.198
Surely it can't make
that much difference.

01:11:31.330 --> 01:11:33.666
- We're losing the hot air.

01:11:35.801 --> 01:11:38.370
(wind howling)

01:11:38.504 --> 01:11:41.274
(flame roaring)

01:11:46.745 --> 01:11:47.780
- [Zach] Oh shit.

01:11:47.914 --> 01:11:49.448
That hole's getting bigger.

01:11:49.582 --> 01:11:52.484
- I think we have
to fix the balloon.

01:11:52.618 --> 01:11:54.720
If we tied down that
piece of canvas up there.

01:11:54.855 --> 01:11:57.623
Maybe we can stop losing height.

01:11:58.691 --> 01:12:00.293
We could use this.

01:12:03.263 --> 01:12:06.132
- You're fucking crazy.

01:12:06.266 --> 01:12:08.902
- I don't see we have a choice.

01:12:10.003 --> 01:12:11.071
(fabric tearing)

01:12:11.204 --> 01:12:13.874
(wind howling)

01:12:14.841 --> 01:12:17.911
(thunder crackling)

01:12:18.678 --> 01:12:21.715
(rain pattering)

01:12:22.883 --> 01:12:25.719
(wind howling)

01:12:28.387 --> 01:12:30.891
(Emmy groaning)

01:12:31.024 --> 01:12:32.259
- [Zach] Careful.

01:12:37.664 --> 01:12:41.234
(Emmy groaning)

01:12:41.369 --> 01:12:44.338
(tense suspenseful music)

01:12:44.471 --> 01:12:48.141
(Emmy groaning)

01:12:48.408 --> 01:12:50.911
- [Zach] Hold on,
let me help you.

01:12:54.382 --> 01:12:55.882
(wind howling)

01:12:56.016 --> 01:12:56.783
Oh shit.

01:12:58.219 --> 01:13:00.487
(wind howling)

01:13:07.328 --> 01:13:09.130
(rain pattering)

01:13:09.263 --> 01:13:12.499
(Emmy and Zach groaning)

01:13:15.735 --> 01:13:17.938
(Zach groaning)

01:13:18.072 --> 01:13:20.907
(metal clanging)

01:13:27.214 --> 01:13:30.517
(tense suspenseful music)

01:13:34.355 --> 01:13:39.126
(thunder crackling)
(wind howling)

01:13:57.044 --> 01:13:58.746
(Emmy groaning)

01:13:59.046 --> 01:14:01.749
(Emmy screaming)

01:14:02.582 --> 01:14:05.419
(Emmy groaning)

01:14:13.027 --> 01:14:15.796
(wind howling)

01:14:17.698 --> 01:14:19.066
(Emmy groaning)

01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:22.403
(rain pattering)

01:14:22.670 --> 01:14:25.873
(thunder roaring)

01:14:26.007 --> 01:14:27.375
I got it.

01:14:27.508 --> 01:14:32.279
(wind howling)
(metal clanging)

01:14:32.414 --> 01:14:35.149
(material tearing)

01:14:37.685 --> 01:14:39.553
(Emmy groaning)

01:14:39.687 --> 01:14:40.621
Catch it.

01:14:43.024 --> 01:14:43.991
(Zach groaning)

01:14:44.125 --> 01:14:46.994
(rain pattering)

01:14:53.801 --> 01:14:55.203
I'm coming down.

01:14:58.106 --> 01:14:59.241
(Emmy screaming)

01:14:59.374 --> 01:15:02.144
(Zach groaning)

01:15:04.446 --> 01:15:07.715
(wind howling)

01:15:07.848 --> 01:15:11.919
(thunder crackling)

01:15:12.054 --> 01:15:14.322
- [Zach] You have
to light the burner.

01:15:14.456 --> 01:15:17.192
(Emmy groaning)

01:15:18.726 --> 01:15:20.328
- Pass me the rope.

01:15:25.167 --> 01:15:27.936
(Zach groaning)

01:15:29.770 --> 01:15:31.840
- [Zach] You think it'll hold?

01:15:31.973 --> 01:15:33.341
- [Emmy] It has to.

01:15:34.675 --> 01:15:35.743
- Ready?

01:15:35.877 --> 01:15:37.345
(flame roaring)
(Zach groaning)

01:15:37.479 --> 01:15:41.283
(Emmy groaning)

01:15:41.416 --> 01:15:43.752
I don't if this is working.

01:15:55.530 --> 01:15:56.465
We're gonna hit that.

01:15:56.598 --> 01:15:57.599
We're gonna hit it.

01:15:57.732 --> 01:15:59.701
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:07.209
(tense suspenseful
music crescendos)

01:16:07.342 --> 01:16:10.645
(basket thudding)
(Emmy and Zach groaning)

01:16:10.779 --> 01:16:14.216
(Emmy and Zach gasping)

01:16:22.425 --> 01:16:25.561
(wind whooshing)

01:16:25.694 --> 01:16:29.332
(hopeful triumphant music)

01:16:40.942 --> 01:16:43.845
- It looks way
flatter down there.

01:16:44.713 --> 01:16:46.315
- Yeah.

01:16:46.449 --> 01:16:49.519
- Yeah, I think we might
be through the worst of it.

01:16:49.651 --> 01:16:50.486
- Made it.

01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:52.355
We made it.

01:16:52.488 --> 01:16:53.788
Oh my God.

01:16:53.922 --> 01:16:56.092
We're over a field.

01:16:56.225 --> 01:16:59.761
We're safe to land. (sighs)

01:17:04.833 --> 01:17:07.769
(thunder roaring)

01:17:14.709 --> 01:17:19.315
(hopeful triumphant
music continues)

01:17:50.813 --> 01:17:53.482
(Emmy sighing)

01:17:58.321 --> 01:18:00.356
(Zach sighing)

01:18:00.490 --> 01:18:03.359
(wind howling)

01:18:06.829 --> 01:18:09.666
(phone clacking)

01:18:11.535 --> 01:18:15.071
- So much for escaping
from your problems.

01:18:16.340 --> 01:18:19.041
(Zach groaning)

01:18:23.714 --> 01:18:26.516
(Zach sighing)

01:18:40.564 --> 01:18:44.101
- How did she know about
your initialed socks?

01:18:47.903 --> 01:18:53.477
Zach, how did Julia know
about your initialed socks?

01:18:53.610 --> 01:18:54.544
- I don't know.

01:18:54.678 --> 01:18:56.380
I mean, they're socks.

01:18:56.513 --> 01:19:01.418
It's not like I have to be
undressed to see my socks,

01:19:01.551 --> 01:19:02.885
- But you got to
have your shoes off

01:19:03.020 --> 01:19:06.590
to see the initials
on your ones.

01:19:06.923 --> 01:19:09.993
Did you take your
shoes off in the bar?

01:19:12.763 --> 01:19:17.067
Why would you take your
shoes off in the bar?

01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:18.168
I don't know, maybe
if you've been walking

01:19:18.302 --> 01:19:19.970
for miles in new shoes,

01:19:20.103 --> 01:19:23.640
but yours are all worn
in and handmade in Italy.

01:19:26.310 --> 01:19:28.245
Plus you told me you've been
stuck in the boardroom all day.

01:19:28.378 --> 01:19:31.515
- Oh my God, Emmy.

01:19:31.649 --> 01:19:35.285
What more do you want me to
do to make you believe me?

01:19:35.419 --> 01:19:38.989
(ominous suspenseful music)

01:19:39.122 --> 01:19:41.925
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?

01:19:42.794 --> 01:19:43.661
Emmy?

01:19:43.795 --> 01:19:45.362
- Where's her phone?

01:19:52.936 --> 01:19:54.237
- I don't know.

01:19:54.371 --> 01:19:56.873
(wood creaking)

01:20:01.111 --> 01:20:03.046
(wind howling)

01:20:03.180 --> 01:20:06.451
(ominous suspenseful
music continues)

01:20:07.250 --> 01:20:09.687
- Give me your phone.

01:20:09.821 --> 01:20:11.389
- [Zach] Huh?

01:20:11.522 --> 01:20:13.558
- If you got nothing to
hide, give me your phone.

01:20:13.691 --> 01:20:15.660
- (sighs) Fine.

01:20:19.930 --> 01:20:20.832
Jesus.

01:20:23.334 --> 01:20:26.170
(phone clicking)

01:20:33.877 --> 01:20:38.349
(ominous suspenseful
music continues)

01:20:38.483 --> 01:20:41.819
- See, I told you
about those messages.

01:20:43.187 --> 01:20:45.256
I'm not hiding anything.

01:20:46.724 --> 01:20:47.992
Oh, come on.

01:20:48.126 --> 01:20:49.494
This is getting ridiculous.
Just...

01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:56.768
God, you smell good.

01:20:56.901 --> 01:20:58.002
That's not me.

01:20:58.136 --> 01:20:59.604
I'm gonna jump in the shower.

01:21:00.037 --> 01:21:02.841
- [Julia] Don't be too long.

01:21:10.515 --> 01:21:15.086
(ominous suspenseful
music continues)

01:21:26.665 --> 01:21:28.966
- I really shouldn't do this.

01:21:29.100 --> 01:21:31.904
- That's what makes
it so exciting.

01:21:35.841 --> 01:21:37.876
(lips smacking)

01:21:38.009 --> 01:21:39.745
You must be in a
really difficult place

01:21:39.878 --> 01:21:42.881
after what had happened at work.

01:21:43.014 --> 01:21:44.115
- Why?

01:21:44.248 --> 01:21:45.116
You mean the guy

01:21:45.249 --> 01:21:46.885
who killed himself?

01:21:48.687 --> 01:21:50.923
He's just a worthless
piece of shit

01:21:51.055 --> 01:21:53.725
begging not to be flushed away.

01:21:57.796 --> 01:22:00.732
(lips smacking)

01:22:00.866 --> 01:22:04.235
- It's amazing you
can be so strong.

01:22:04.369 --> 01:22:05.838
- I thrive on it.

01:22:09.207 --> 01:22:11.844
(lips smacking)

01:22:13.946 --> 01:22:16.682
(Julia sighing)

01:22:22.987 --> 01:22:24.356
- You happy now?

01:22:26.158 --> 01:22:29.194
You found what you
were looking for.

01:22:33.499 --> 01:22:38.036
(ominous suspenseful
music continues)

01:22:41.106 --> 01:22:42.641
- You lied to me.

01:22:46.612 --> 01:22:47.846
You looked me in the eye

01:22:47.981 --> 01:22:52.651
and you just bare
face lied to me.

01:22:55.254 --> 01:22:56.221
Repeatedly.

01:23:00.459 --> 01:23:02.394
How many other women?

01:23:07.834 --> 01:23:09.903
Do you even care?

01:23:10.035 --> 01:23:11.971
- Of course, I care.

01:23:13.438 --> 01:23:16.843
I care about a lot of things.

01:23:16.976 --> 01:23:19.244
I care about having a family.

01:23:19.378 --> 01:23:23.348
Not that that's something
that you can give me.

01:23:24.651 --> 01:23:27.319
(Emmy sighing)

01:23:29.121 --> 01:23:30.557
- So you're blaming me?

01:23:30.690 --> 01:23:32.190
- I'm not the one
who's done nothing

01:23:32.324 --> 01:23:35.728
but just wallow in their
own guilt and self pity.

01:23:35.862 --> 01:23:37.564
- Guilt and self pity?

01:23:38.498 --> 01:23:39.999
- Guilt.

01:23:40.132 --> 01:23:41.868
You don't fucking know
what guilt is, Zach.

01:23:42.001 --> 01:23:44.938
- Guilt is for the weak.

01:23:45.070 --> 01:23:46.639
And that's hardly me, is it.

01:23:46.773 --> 01:23:50.242
- Zach, you fucked a
woman you met in a bar

01:23:50.376 --> 01:23:52.879
the night before we planned
to repair our marriage.

01:23:53.012 --> 01:23:54.047
- Emmy, Emmy, Emmy.

01:23:54.179 --> 01:23:54.914
Come on.

01:23:55.048 --> 01:23:56.049
Listen.

01:23:56.181 --> 01:23:57.249
What?

01:23:57.383 --> 01:23:59.117
What would you have done?

01:23:59.252 --> 01:24:00.286
Hmm?

01:24:00.420 --> 01:24:02.021
- [Emmy] What would I have done?

01:24:02.154 --> 01:24:04.857
- I mean, you haven't been
putting out for months.

01:24:04.991 --> 01:24:06.793
- Putting out.

01:24:06.926 --> 01:24:10.964
So all this just being
understanding and sympathetic

01:24:11.096 --> 01:24:13.967
and giving me time
was just what?

01:24:14.099 --> 01:24:15.535
Bullshit.

01:24:15.668 --> 01:24:16.970
Just a fucking act.

01:24:17.103 --> 01:24:20.074
- You can sound so
ungrateful sometimes.

01:24:20.206 --> 01:24:22.909
Think about the
life that you have.

01:24:23.043 --> 01:24:26.245
You've got this amazing house.

01:24:26.379 --> 01:24:27.413
You got a shit-hot car.

01:24:27.714 --> 01:24:28.881
- A shit-hot car?

01:24:29.016 --> 01:24:30.084
This is insane.
- You want for nothing.

01:24:30.216 --> 01:24:31.484
- Zach, can you hear yourself?

01:24:31.618 --> 01:24:33.453
Do you think that's
the life I want?

01:24:33.586 --> 01:24:35.455
Going to some pretentious
dinner parties with some insane,

01:24:35.588 --> 01:24:37.890
humorless pricks who
care about nothing

01:24:38.025 --> 01:24:40.827
but their position and how
much money they make per year.

01:24:40.961 --> 01:24:41.996
- [Zach] Emmy.

01:24:42.128 --> 01:24:42.930
- Who do you think you are?

01:24:43.063 --> 01:24:44.965
- Emmy, stop.
- Stop?

01:24:45.099 --> 01:24:47.767
- Before you say something
that you can't take back.

01:24:47.901 --> 01:24:49.302
Do you know what
your problem is?

01:24:49.435 --> 01:24:50.904
- My problem?

01:24:51.038 --> 01:24:53.673
- You just don't
appreciate what you've got.

01:24:53.807 --> 01:24:55.274
You know, where would
you be without me?

01:24:55.408 --> 01:24:56.944
Really?

01:24:57.077 --> 01:25:00.114
You're a kindergarten
teacher. (laughs)

01:25:00.246 --> 01:25:02.415
And you would make more
money cleaning toilets.

01:25:02.548 --> 01:25:03.516
- Fuck you.

01:25:05.218 --> 01:25:06.120
Fuck you.

01:25:07.420 --> 01:25:09.589
You horrible human being.

01:25:10.891 --> 01:25:11.959
This is over.

01:25:12.092 --> 01:25:13.493
I'm getting a fucking divorce.

01:25:13.627 --> 01:25:14.695
And you know what?

01:25:14.828 --> 01:25:16.295
I'm taking half of everything,

01:25:16.429 --> 01:25:18.132
including your daddy's
precious company.

01:25:18.264 --> 01:25:21.167
And believe me, it's gonna
be run very differently.

01:25:21.300 --> 01:25:22.603
- Oh, sweetie.

01:25:22.736 --> 01:25:23.771
Come on, you're
not going anywhere.

01:25:23.904 --> 01:25:26.305
You can't afford to divorce me,

01:25:26.439 --> 01:25:28.408
and you're certainly not
getting anything of mine.

01:25:28.776 --> 01:25:30.010
Ah. Whoa.

01:25:30.144 --> 01:25:31.512
(tense dramatic music)

01:25:31.845 --> 01:25:33.147
(Zach groaning)

01:25:33.279 --> 01:25:34.982
Fuck.
Emmy.

01:25:35.115 --> 01:25:35.749
Emmy.

01:25:35.883 --> 01:25:38.719
(Zach groaning)

01:25:41.388 --> 01:25:43.957
(Zach screaming)

01:25:44.992 --> 01:25:47.361
Emmy.
Emmy, help me.

01:25:47.494 --> 01:25:48.227
Help me.

01:25:50.030 --> 01:25:51.799
Please.

01:25:51.932 --> 01:25:54.001
Please, do something.

01:25:54.134 --> 01:25:55.569
Where are you going?

01:25:55.703 --> 01:25:56.837
Emmy.

01:25:56.970 --> 01:25:59.139
Emmy, where are you going? Emmy.

01:25:59.273 --> 01:26:03.010
If you let me fall, they're
gonna pin this all on you.

01:26:03.310 --> 01:26:04.712
They'll take you down.

01:26:04.845 --> 01:26:08.215
You won't get away with this.

01:26:08.348 --> 01:26:09.583
You're gonna spend the rest

01:26:09.717 --> 01:26:12.087
of your miserable
life in prison.

01:26:13.687 --> 01:26:14.555
Help me.

01:26:14.688 --> 01:26:16.323
Help me.

01:26:16.457 --> 01:26:18.093
Emmy, come back, please.

01:26:18.225 --> 01:26:19.160
Please.

01:26:21.528 --> 01:26:23.064
Emmy!

01:26:23.198 --> 01:26:24.132
What are you doing?

01:26:24.264 --> 01:26:25.432
Emmy, don't.

01:26:25.566 --> 01:26:26.700
