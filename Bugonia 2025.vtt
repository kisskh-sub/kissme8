<i>It all starts
with something... magnificent.</i>

00:51.579 --> 00:53.362
<i>A flower.</i>

00:53.363 --> 00:54.582
<i>Just a flower.</i>

00:56.279 --> 00:59.108
<i>Then a honeybee.</i>

01:00.240 --> 01:02.458
<i>Very fragile.</i>

01:02.459 --> 01:04.548
<i>Very complicated.</i>

01:05.854 --> 01:09.726
<i>The bee gathers pollen</i>

01:09.727 --> 01:13.817
<i>and deposits it
in another flower's stigma.</i>

01:13.818 --> 01:17.082
<i>It's like sex but cleaner.</i>

01:17.083 --> 01:18.735
<i>And nobody gets hurt.</i>

01:52.770 --> 01:57.905
A third of our food
is pollinated this way.

01:57.906 --> 02:00.256
You understand
the scope of that?

02:01.301 --> 02:04.477
That's how vital
the bees are, Don.

02:04.478 --> 02:07.176
And they're dying.

02:08.177 --> 02:09.743
Why?

02:09.744 --> 02:12.833
It's like we talked about, cuz.
Remember?

02:12.834 --> 02:16.446
CCD. It's like a pandemic.

02:19.580 --> 02:23.104
Workers desert the queen

02:23.105 --> 02:26.977
until she's all alone
with her young,

02:26.978 --> 02:29.807
and the colony wastes away.

02:33.507 --> 02:36.858
But why do they leave her?

02:37.859 --> 02:39.773
Well...

02:39.774 --> 02:42.776
people claim it's pesticides
or habitat loss.

02:42.777 --> 02:45.039
Or some people think
world governments

02:45.040 --> 02:48.564
and their agro-corporate
overlords

02:48.565 --> 02:52.352
bioengineered CCD
to manipulate food supplies.

02:53.744 --> 02:57.312
<i>But I knew there had to be</i>

02:57.313 --> 03:00.229
<i>a larger organizing
principle at work.</i>

03:01.230 --> 03:02.884
<i>So I studied.</i>

03:04.015 --> 03:05.451
<i>I observed.</i>

03:05.452 --> 03:06.843
Down.

03:06.844 --> 03:08.758
<i>I searched in the ground</i>

03:08.759 --> 03:11.544
<i>and in the stars</i>

03:11.545 --> 03:14.634
<i>until I found it.</i>

03:19.030 --> 03:21.858
<i>It was there all along.</i>

03:25.863 --> 03:28.996
<i>Fucking caging us,
poisoning us,</i>

03:28.997 --> 03:31.042
<i>choking us out.</i>

03:32.000 --> 03:33.522
One. Two.

03:33.523 --> 03:35.959
<i>We are not steering
the ship, Don.</i>

03:35.960 --> 03:37.613
Oh, good job.

03:37.614 --> 03:39.442
<i>They are.</i>

03:42.358 --> 03:45.752
<i>And now it's up to you and me</i>

03:45.753 --> 03:47.755
<i>to stop them.</i>

03:49.974 --> 03:53.194
<i>The training
is for a reason, Don.</i>

03:53.195 --> 03:55.327
<i>It's going to try
and dominate us,</i>

03:55.328 --> 03:58.330
<i>but we're not gonna
let it, are we?</i>

03:58.331 --> 04:01.420
You mean
she'll try to hurt us?

04:01.421 --> 04:03.900
<i>Oh, yes, Don.
It's highly dangerous.</i>

04:08.645 --> 04:10.298
<i>So we have to prepare...</i>

04:10.299 --> 04:13.214
- Down. Up.
<i>- ...our bodies, our brains.</i>

04:13.215 --> 04:15.260
Come on. Come on. Come on.

04:27.316 --> 04:28.925
Why are you laughing?

04:28.926 --> 04:30.666
Sorry, you just look
a little funny doing that,

04:30.667 --> 04:32.015
to be honest. Sorry, Teddy.

04:32.016 --> 04:33.757
- Okay, well, now you do it.
- Okay.

04:38.153 --> 04:40.023
Hey, I think I look funny, too.

04:40.024 --> 04:41.548
Okay.

04:44.159 --> 04:45.681
See? It's good.

04:48.946 --> 04:52.210
<i>Oh, and don't forget
they track it remotely.</i>

04:53.342 --> 04:55.823
<i>And they'll try
and track us, too.</i>

04:57.477 --> 05:01.306
<i>It'll... weevil into your
brainbox every chance it gets,</i>

05:01.307 --> 05:03.961
<i>so we have to fortify
that shit.</i>

05:06.877 --> 05:08.226
Okay.

05:09.619 --> 05:11.446
I'll try.

05:11.447 --> 05:13.622
You-you hear that, though?

05:13.623 --> 05:15.494
Donny?

05:15.495 --> 05:17.758
In your voice, how they
fucked your confidence?

05:19.586 --> 05:21.891
I'm sorry, Teddy.

05:21.892 --> 05:25.418
No. Donny, look at me.

05:26.593 --> 05:28.115
Don't you ever apologize. Ever.

05:28.116 --> 05:30.509
None of this
is your fault. Okay?

05:32.076 --> 05:34.383
Thanks.

05:38.256 --> 05:39.779
<i>It won't play fair.</i>

05:41.521 --> 05:43.653
<i>So we have to be better.</i>

05:47.091 --> 05:49.963
How can you tell them apart?

05:49.964 --> 05:52.879
Well, you have to know
where to look.

05:52.880 --> 05:55.142
There are signs.

05:57.232 --> 05:58.972
What about these people?

05:58.973 --> 06:01.496
No.

06:01.497 --> 06:03.585
No, they're fine.

06:03.586 --> 06:06.588
I mean, they're not fine-fine,

06:06.589 --> 06:08.764
but hollowed.

06:08.765 --> 06:10.331
You know, like the rest of us.

06:10.332 --> 06:11.941
Harmless.

06:11.942 --> 06:14.248
Hopeless.

06:16.730 --> 06:18.992
<i>And that's the way
they planned it.</i>

06:18.993 --> 06:22.822
<i>To make us the same
as the bees.</i>

06:22.823 --> 06:28.218
<i>A dead colony, atomized
in a trillion directions</i>

06:28.219 --> 06:30.874
<i>with no way home again.</i>

06:36.837 --> 06:38.794
-Morning, Ms. Fuller.
-Good morning.

06:38.795 --> 06:40.710
Have a good day.

07:00.687 --> 07:02.731
<i>What does the cream do?</i>

07:02.732 --> 07:04.037
The same.

07:04.038 --> 07:05.778
Mitigation.

07:05.779 --> 07:07.257
Here, get all of it.

07:35.548 --> 07:38.332
What if someone finds out
about what we're doing?

07:38.333 --> 07:39.942
They won't.

07:39.943 --> 07:42.032
No one on earth gives
a single fuck about us.

07:46.123 --> 07:48.909
So until the day comes...

07:50.563 --> 07:53.348
...we clear
the psychic cache, okay?

07:54.349 --> 07:56.437
No distractions.

07:56.438 --> 07:59.441
No gaming, no vape,
no whacking it.

08:01.312 --> 08:05.012
No screens whatsoever,
except for research.

08:06.927 --> 08:08.494
You promise, Don?

08:11.366 --> 08:13.454
I know this is a lot,

08:13.455 --> 08:16.196
but I...
I want you with me on this.

08:16.197 --> 08:18.677
I need you, Don.

08:18.678 --> 08:20.243
- Hmm.
- I know...

08:20.244 --> 08:24.421
you're actually smart and brave,

08:24.422 --> 08:27.251
and no one else sees it but me.

08:29.340 --> 08:33.300
No, you're...
No, you're the smart one.

08:33.301 --> 08:37.174
The brains of this
operation, really. Hmm.

08:38.785 --> 08:43.180
- Hmm. But...
- Is something wrong?

08:45.052 --> 08:46.792
I just...

08:46.793 --> 08:48.445
I don't think I can do this.

08:48.446 --> 08:49.751
Hey.

08:49.752 --> 08:51.231
Come here.

08:51.232 --> 08:52.885
Hmm.

08:52.886 --> 08:55.104
- Give me a hug.
- Ah.

08:55.105 --> 08:56.758
I love you, cuzzie.

08:56.759 --> 08:59.849
I love you, too, man.

09:03.723 --> 09:06.421
You're my best friend
in the whole world.

09:07.378 --> 09:09.423
My only friend.

09:09.424 --> 09:12.427
And I'm doing this
to save you most of all.

09:13.602 --> 09:16.213
I won't let anyone
hurt you, okay?

09:18.302 --> 09:19.476
Okay?

09:19.477 --> 09:21.391
- Okay.
- Never.

09:21.392 --> 09:22.610
Yeah.

09:22.611 --> 09:25.527
Medroxyprogesterone acetate.

09:26.789 --> 09:29.923
It's a progestin-type
hormonal med.

09:31.446 --> 09:34.057
Chemical castration.

09:35.755 --> 09:38.192
- Okay?
- Okay.

09:42.152 --> 09:46.895
In order for us to hit
maximum focus,

09:46.896 --> 09:52.075
we have to clear our heads of
all psychic compulsions, okay?

09:53.642 --> 09:55.295
What does that mean?

09:55.296 --> 09:56.992
Hey, buddy.

09:56.993 --> 09:59.778
Trust me, I've done
a shit ton of research on this.

09:59.779 --> 10:01.780
The more of that
fuck filler we have

10:01.781 --> 10:03.520
jamming up our neurons,

10:03.521 --> 10:06.307
the bigger advantage
it will have over us.

10:07.264 --> 10:08.830
Are you sure?

10:10.137 --> 10:11.617
Yes, Donny, I'm sure.

10:13.706 --> 10:15.969
It's really important, Don.

10:19.059 --> 10:21.147
I just...

10:21.148 --> 10:25.718
wanted to be
with someone someday.

10:27.807 --> 10:29.634
Bud...

10:29.635 --> 10:31.157
you gotta believe me.

10:31.158 --> 10:32.986
I've figured it out.

10:34.727 --> 10:38.077
The part of your brain
that distracts you,

10:38.078 --> 10:39.992
part of your brain
that makes you sad,

10:39.993 --> 10:43.125
it's all connected
to the biological imperative.

10:43.126 --> 10:47.086
These synapses firing off
on procreation

10:47.087 --> 10:51.873
and seed spread and monogamy,

10:51.874 --> 10:54.834
like all these
fucking pain traps.

10:56.400 --> 11:00.447
It's all...
it's all neurons, dude.

11:00.448 --> 11:02.972
You just have to harness them.

11:04.452 --> 11:07.193
Once you kill the urges,
like I have,

11:07.194 --> 11:10.284
you'll be your own master.

11:12.242 --> 11:14.200
No one can fuck with you.

11:14.201 --> 11:16.594
You'll be totally free.

11:17.900 --> 11:20.033
Don't you want to be free?

11:22.209 --> 11:23.905
Yes.

11:23.906 --> 11:25.691
So you ready?

11:27.867 --> 11:30.608
Let's do this.

11:31.740 --> 11:33.349
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

11:33.350 --> 11:35.308
Okay, so, uh...

11:35.309 --> 11:37.484
Lean over the chair
and talk to me.

11:37.485 --> 11:39.355
- It'll distract you.
- Yeah.

11:39.356 --> 11:41.531
How are you, Teddy?

11:41.532 --> 11:43.055
I'm doing great, man.

11:43.056 --> 11:44.709
How are you?

11:44.710 --> 11:47.407
Uh, I'm doing good.

11:47.408 --> 11:49.888
So, you excited to be free?

11:49.889 --> 11:51.324
Yeah.

11:51.325 --> 11:53.456
What does free
feel like to you?

11:53.457 --> 11:55.807
I guess it...

11:55.808 --> 11:58.418
feels like when we were little,

11:58.419 --> 12:00.812
before things got bad.

12:00.813 --> 12:03.729
When everyone was still here.

12:04.904 --> 12:08.080
Hey, hey.

12:08.081 --> 12:11.126
I know it's been hard, man.

12:11.127 --> 12:15.566
But we're gonna get it
back again. I promise.

12:16.567 --> 12:19.178
<i>All we've lost,</i>

12:19.179 --> 12:22.312
<i>all these years, all the shit
that's been done to us...</i>

12:23.618 --> 12:26.490
<i>...we're setting that shit
right again.</i>

12:27.665 --> 12:30.363
<i>And no one can fuck with us.</i>

12:30.364 --> 12:32.365
<i>Not even ourselves.</i>

12:32.366 --> 12:35.108
- Morning, Corey.
- Good morning, Michelle.

13:02.091 --> 13:03.831
I believe every company
should strive

13:03.832 --> 13:06.007
to form a diverse table.

13:06.008 --> 13:08.401
If the people on your team
are from diverse backgrounds,

13:08.402 --> 13:10.925
they'll find new and creative
solutions to problems

13:10.926 --> 13:12.666
rather than just iterating.

13:12.667 --> 13:14.320
We need to find
the next generation

13:14.321 --> 13:15.669
of diverse engineers,

13:15.670 --> 13:18.063
diverse biologists,
diverse doctors.

13:18.064 --> 13:20.369
Because it's not just
diverse employees,

13:20.370 --> 13:21.893
it's diverse thinking.

13:21.894 --> 13:24.634
It's about using
our corporate resources

13:24.635 --> 13:29.378
to empower people of different
skills and identities...

13:29.379 --> 13:30.945
Holy fucking fucker.

13:30.946 --> 13:32.164
Jesus Christ.

13:32.165 --> 13:34.079
Every time. What is it?

13:34.080 --> 13:35.776
"Skills and identities
to foster..."

13:35.777 --> 13:36.951
To foster a new
generation of Auxolith talent.

13:36.952 --> 13:38.127
Okay, let's reset.

13:39.259 --> 13:40.825
It's too many "diverses," Chris.

13:40.826 --> 13:42.391
It's-- I'm going,
"diverse, diverse, diverse."

13:42.392 --> 13:44.002
Like "Buh-duh,
buh-duh, buh-duh."

13:44.003 --> 13:45.655
Like a fucking metronome.

13:45.656 --> 13:48.920
Well, uh, [clears throat],
it is diversity training.

13:48.921 --> 13:50.573
Yeah, but it's too many, Chris.

13:50.574 --> 13:52.837
Can we try to diversify
the language a little bit?

13:52.838 --> 13:55.143
No, sure.

13:55.144 --> 13:56.885
Let's go again.

14:01.585 --> 14:03.064
Okay, so that's it then.

14:03.065 --> 14:04.979
You just have
the investor call with Sara

14:04.980 --> 14:08.635
and a VC with Wieden+Kennedy
at 9:00 that you can do remote.

14:08.636 --> 14:11.507
Thank you, Corey.

14:11.508 --> 14:12.944
The 5:30 thing.

14:12.945 --> 14:14.467
Uh-huh?

14:14.468 --> 14:15.816
Look, I know you sent
the email already,

14:15.817 --> 14:17.165
but I need you
to let everyone know

14:17.166 --> 14:18.558
that they are free
to leave at 5:30

14:18.559 --> 14:20.603
from now on,
starting today, okay?

14:20.604 --> 14:22.562
But do it in a way
that's, you know,

14:22.563 --> 14:24.085
what we talked about.

14:24.086 --> 14:25.826
- Yeah, of course.
- We need to send the message

14:25.827 --> 14:27.523
that we have a new culture
here now.

14:27.524 --> 14:29.264
Where people should,
yes, of course,

14:29.265 --> 14:31.353
feel free to leave at 5:30
and be with their families.

14:31.354 --> 14:33.268
No one is gonna be overworked
like in the past.

14:33.269 --> 14:35.357
No more unpleasant incidents.

14:35.358 --> 14:37.446
But, of course,
it's not compulsory.

14:37.447 --> 14:39.361
And, obviously, if people
still have work to do,

14:39.362 --> 14:41.407
they should absolutely stay
and continue to work.

14:41.408 --> 14:43.757
- Yeah.
- But it's not strictly enforced.

14:43.758 --> 14:45.977
Although we still do want
to meet quotas.

14:45.978 --> 14:48.109
So if we can do that
with no pressure,

14:48.110 --> 14:50.068
just remembering, you know,
we are running a business here,

14:50.069 --> 14:52.200
so "let your conscience
guide you" kind of thing.

14:52.201 --> 14:53.636
Yeah? Good?

14:53.637 --> 14:55.029
I'll definitely let them know.

14:55.030 --> 14:56.770
Great.

14:56.771 --> 14:58.163
New era.

14:58.164 --> 15:00.601
Thank you, Corey.

15:07.477 --> 15:08.782
Thanks, Tony.

15:08.783 --> 15:10.740
Feel free to leave early.

15:10.741 --> 15:12.568
I mean, unless you're busy.

15:12.569 --> 15:15.615
Or you have things to do,
but feel free if you can.

15:15.616 --> 15:17.269
- Up to you.
- Yes, ma'am.

15:17.270 --> 15:19.053

Come on, come on.

16:21.160 --> 16:22.203
No.

16:31.735 --> 16:33.519
Shit! Fuck, fuck!

17:34.755 --> 17:36.800
No, no, no! Stay back with her.

17:46.549 --> 17:48.595
Spray! Spray!

18:11.444 --> 18:12.922
Really have to hurry, bud.

18:12.923 --> 18:15.664
- Um, I know. I'm sorry.
- Okay, quick as you can.

18:15.665 --> 18:17.927
It's like GPS, remember?

18:17.928 --> 18:20.452
If its hair is still attached,
it can track us remotely,

18:20.453 --> 18:22.236
so we want to go
as quick as we can.

18:22.237 --> 18:24.151
Okay.

18:24.152 --> 18:25.500
Is it working?

18:25.501 --> 18:28.590
Not much is coming off.

18:28.591 --> 18:30.549
Y-You really, you really
got to run it through. Harder.

18:30.550 --> 18:32.377
But wh-what if I cut her?

18:32.378 --> 18:34.683
Don! Do it harder!
You won't cut her!

18:34.684 --> 18:35.771
Okay.

18:59.144 --> 19:01.319
Man, I feel good. Don't you?

19:01.320 --> 19:02.624
I guess.

19:02.625 --> 19:04.539
You were amazing, cuz.

19:04.540 --> 19:05.758
I was?

19:05.759 --> 19:07.368
Oh, yeah.

19:07.369 --> 19:09.849
Fucking alpha king shit.

19:09.850 --> 19:12.721
Well, thanks, man.

19:12.722 --> 19:14.158
I knew you could do it.

19:14.159 --> 19:17.640
Sure enough,
you fucking crushed it.

19:23.907 --> 19:25.604
Incredible.

19:25.605 --> 19:27.388
What is?

19:27.389 --> 19:30.043
Just the detail.

19:30.044 --> 19:31.697
The best I've seen.

19:31.698 --> 19:34.830
Uh, how can you tell
she's an alien?

19:34.831 --> 19:39.183
Well, the signs are obvious.

19:39.184 --> 19:41.402
They did a hell of a job on it,
but the tells are there.

19:41.403 --> 19:43.622
Narrow feet.

19:43.623 --> 19:46.581
Thin cuticles.

19:46.582 --> 19:49.194
Slight overbite.

19:52.458 --> 19:55.286
Semi-obtruding earlobes.

19:55.287 --> 19:56.548
See?

19:56.549 --> 19:59.072
High hair density.

19:59.073 --> 20:03.076
You won't notice unless you know
what you're looking for.

20:03.077 --> 20:05.426
Guess I can see it.

20:05.427 --> 20:09.996
It's like,
if you don't cook steaks a lot,

20:09.997 --> 20:11.867
you won't know
when it's cooked medium-rare,

20:11.868 --> 20:16.394
but if you cook steaks
all the time, you just know.

20:16.395 --> 20:18.178
You don't even
have to cut into it.

20:18.179 --> 20:20.747
You just... know.

20:23.489 --> 20:26.099
Hey, hey, um...

20:26.100 --> 20:28.362
Why are we doing this?

20:28.363 --> 20:29.929
Is she itchy?

20:29.930 --> 20:32.801
No, Don. It's not itchy.

20:32.802 --> 20:36.196
Its genetic structure
is the same as ours,

20:36.197 --> 20:39.199
uh, but its nervous system
is different.

20:39.200 --> 20:41.854
The antihistamine reacts
to the neurotransmitters

20:41.855 --> 20:44.944
in its nervous system
and weakens it.

20:44.945 --> 20:48.252
We're just leveling
the playing field.

20:48.253 --> 20:51.733
It's not torture.
Torture is what it's done to us.

20:51.734 --> 20:54.214
Huh.

20:54.215 --> 20:56.303
The sedative
should wear off soon.

20:56.304 --> 20:57.913
Should we go get dressed?

20:57.914 --> 20:59.785
-Okay.
-Okay, come on.

21:14.061 --> 21:16.498
- Is it too tight?
- No, man.

21:18.021 --> 21:20.153
No, this was my dad's shit.

21:20.154 --> 21:22.851
He left it behind for a reason,

21:22.852 --> 21:24.898
so that it could be
put to good use.

21:25.942 --> 21:28.205
Everything's for a reason, Don.

21:29.424 --> 21:31.207
It's too tight.

21:31.208 --> 21:33.558
- I look stupid.
- No, you don't.

21:33.559 --> 21:36.300
You look fine, honestly.
You look fine.

21:36.301 --> 21:38.911
Anyway...
what's that swine gonna do,

21:38.912 --> 21:41.827
call the fashion police
and arrest you?

21:41.828 --> 21:44.482
This isn't about her.

21:44.483 --> 21:46.266
Hey.

21:46.267 --> 21:49.443
It is not in control anymore.

21:49.444 --> 21:50.750
We are.

21:52.360 --> 21:55.797
Besides, I'll be doing
most of the talking anyway.

21:55.798 --> 21:59.105
In fact, maybe don't say much.

21:59.106 --> 22:01.020
Like, you-you don't really
have to say much.

22:01.021 --> 22:02.891
Okay.

22:02.892 --> 22:05.981
Like, don't talk at all, maybe.

22:05.982 --> 22:07.505
Oh.

22:31.878 --> 22:33.314
Welcome.

22:35.185 --> 22:37.273
Are you conscious?

22:37.274 --> 22:40.320
- What?
- Is she conscious?

22:40.321 --> 22:43.845
I can only proceed if
you're fully conscious, so...

22:43.846 --> 22:45.630
Uh...

22:45.631 --> 22:46.979
What?

22:46.980 --> 22:48.981
Yes. Greetings.

22:48.982 --> 22:50.505
This is my home.

22:52.072 --> 22:53.595
Where...

22:56.990 --> 22:59.687
This i-- this is a hospital?

22:59.688 --> 23:03.648
- No, this is not a hospital.
- Is this a...

23:03.649 --> 23:06.651
Fuck it. I'm just gonna start.

23:06.652 --> 23:09.784
"Welcome to the headquarters
of the human resistance.

23:09.785 --> 23:12.439
"Despite our general suspicion
and disavowal

23:12.440 --> 23:14.485
"of all extant governing bodies,

23:14.486 --> 23:17.052
"and despite the fact that you,
as an Andromedan,

23:17.053 --> 23:19.098
"are not subject to
the human rights guidelines

23:19.099 --> 23:21.143
"detailed in
the Geneva Conventions,

23:21.144 --> 23:23.015
"we nevertheless endeavor
to adhere to those guidelines

23:23.016 --> 23:25.714
out of the humanist principles
to which they aspire."

23:26.933 --> 23:28.455
What is happening?

23:28.456 --> 23:30.414
I'm explaining to you
that I would like to keep

23:30.415 --> 23:35.375
all of this very aboveboard
and civilized, so...

23:35.376 --> 23:36.985
Where's my hair?

23:36.986 --> 23:39.901
- Your hair's been destroyed.
- You shaved off my hair?

23:39.902 --> 23:41.990
Yes, we've shaved off your hair.

23:41.991 --> 23:44.471
Why have you shaved off my hair?

23:44.472 --> 23:47.606
To prevent you
from contacting your ship.

23:48.650 --> 23:50.870
- My ship?
- Your ship.

23:51.827 --> 23:53.829
What ship?

23:54.874 --> 23:56.353
Your mother ship.

23:58.312 --> 24:01.227
- Okay.
- Full disclosure:

24:01.228 --> 24:02.620
I've also applied a thin layer

24:02.621 --> 24:04.404
of antihistamine cream
to your skin...

24:04.405 --> 24:06.493
- Excuse me. Listen to me.
- ...which we'll need to reapply

24:06.494 --> 24:07.668
every day
for full effectiveness.

24:07.669 --> 24:09.454
Listen to me.

24:11.368 --> 24:13.152
I'm listening.

24:13.153 --> 24:14.328
Right.

24:15.938 --> 24:18.766
H-Here's what's gonna happen.

24:18.767 --> 24:22.204
And I want to be clear,
I'm not threatening you.

24:22.205 --> 24:23.510
Or you.

24:23.511 --> 24:26.600
But the following is
my best guess

24:26.601 --> 24:30.561
of how the next 48 hours
are likely to transpire.

24:30.562 --> 24:32.693
The police
and soon thereafter the FBI

24:32.694 --> 24:34.129
will begin a statewide manhunt

24:34.130 --> 24:36.392
using all of the methods
at their disposal

24:36.393 --> 24:40.092
and the combined resources
of neighboring jurisdictions.

24:40.093 --> 24:43.704
My company is a key job creator

24:43.705 --> 24:45.793
and economic engine
of the region.

24:45.794 --> 24:47.273
I am crucial.

24:47.274 --> 24:50.276
Think of it like
you've abducted the governor

24:50.277 --> 24:51.756
but worse.

24:51.757 --> 24:53.322
That's the level
of bureaucratic urgency

24:53.323 --> 24:54.541
you're contending with here.

24:54.542 --> 24:56.543
In all humility, I can say that.

24:56.544 --> 24:59.764
I'm also a high-profile
female corporate executive.

24:59.765 --> 25:01.200
Does that add a certain,

25:01.201 --> 25:02.723
you know,
politicized optics to this?

25:02.724 --> 25:04.116
I would say absolutely.

25:04.117 --> 25:06.335
I would say
that's a tremendous factor

25:06.336 --> 25:08.381
for you to consider here.

25:08.382 --> 25:10.470
Now, I don't make the rules,
and I don't enforce anything,

25:10.471 --> 25:13.995
and I am not in charge
of the situation in this room.

25:13.996 --> 25:15.780
You are.

25:15.781 --> 25:19.000
But you are not in charge
of what is happening out there,

25:19.001 --> 25:22.308
and what is happening out there
is a rapid cross-coordination

25:22.309 --> 25:24.353
of law enforcement
and digital media,

25:24.354 --> 25:25.746
which is all leading
quite inevitably

25:25.747 --> 25:27.705
to your imprisonment.

25:27.706 --> 25:30.185
And very likely worse.

25:30.186 --> 25:31.927
If I can be frank.

25:33.755 --> 25:36.017
I-I'm not privy to
what their methods might be

25:36.018 --> 25:39.543
under extreme duress,
or yours for that matter,

25:39.544 --> 25:43.372
but I can assure you that
there is no possible scenario

25:43.373 --> 25:44.983
where you benefit
from this incident,

25:44.984 --> 25:48.247
unless you cooperate with me
right now

25:48.248 --> 25:51.556
and negotiate a deal that's fair
and advantageous to us both.

25:59.215 --> 26:00.346
Okay.

26:02.567 --> 26:04.264
Wow.

26:05.787 --> 26:08.790
That was really good.
That was really good.

26:10.357 --> 26:12.227
My pulse is racing right now.

26:12.228 --> 26:14.360
Um...

26:14.361 --> 26:15.883
Fuck.

26:15.884 --> 26:18.451
You got a real human response
out of me there,

26:18.452 --> 26:21.846
which is impressive given your
cellular composition and all.

26:21.847 --> 26:24.196
- It-It's the truth.
- Well, no, it's not the truth.

26:24.197 --> 26:26.067
Nothing you say is true.

26:26.068 --> 26:30.203
Objective human truth has no
value in Andromedan cognition.

26:31.334 --> 26:33.814
L-Let's just unpack
the problem here.

26:33.815 --> 26:35.903
"Unpack"? Wow, heady shit.

26:35.904 --> 26:39.124
Sure, let's unpack
the old fact bag, shall we?

26:39.125 --> 26:44.695
You are a high-ranking official
in the royal Andromedan court,

26:44.696 --> 26:48.873
and you've aided your species
in the techno-enslavement

26:48.874 --> 26:50.831
and the agro-corporate
disintegration

26:50.832 --> 26:53.442
of planet Earth, okay?

26:53.443 --> 26:55.880
And we need you to bring us
to your mother ship

26:55.881 --> 26:58.273
on the night
of the lunar eclipse

26:58.274 --> 27:01.450
to broker a sit-down
with your royal superiors.

27:01.451 --> 27:04.192
How's that?
Fucking unpacked enough for ya?

27:04.193 --> 27:05.759
I hear where you're coming from.

27:05.760 --> 27:07.326
I do.

27:07.327 --> 27:09.589
And I respectfully disagree.

27:09.590 --> 27:11.505
On which part?

27:12.941 --> 27:14.942
- Primarily, I'm not an alien.
- You are.

27:14.943 --> 27:17.641
I've done thermal imaging
on your face.

27:17.642 --> 27:20.078
There's Andromedan code
all over your Instagram.

27:20.079 --> 27:22.168
You're barely even hiding it.

27:23.517 --> 27:25.213
I mean, look at you.

27:25.214 --> 27:29.261
I'm supposed to believe
you're a 45-year-old woman?

27:29.262 --> 27:30.784
Human woman?

27:30.785 --> 27:32.656
I mean, I follow a very strict

27:32.657 --> 27:35.528
reverse-aging diet
and therapy program.

27:35.529 --> 27:38.052
It's very expensive, as you can
imagine, but I'm not an alien.

27:39.446 --> 27:41.186
Well, there's really
no time for this.

27:41.187 --> 27:42.970
- You are.
- I'm not.

27:48.890 --> 27:50.543
All right, then.

27:50.544 --> 27:53.111
We're going to give you
the night...

27:53.112 --> 27:55.374
to give your statement.

27:55.375 --> 27:57.115
My statement?

27:57.116 --> 27:58.769
That you will give
to your emperor...

27:58.770 --> 28:00.118
Uh-huh.

28:00.119 --> 28:02.424
...to grant us passage
to your ship

28:02.425 --> 28:05.471
and negotiate your species'
withdrawal from planet Earth.

28:05.472 --> 28:08.300
Right. C-Could we have
a dialogue about this, please?

28:08.301 --> 28:11.825
Because what you're asking me
to do is not quite clear to me.

28:11.826 --> 28:13.261
I think it is.

28:13.262 --> 28:16.048
And I want you to know...

28:18.137 --> 28:20.617
...this is really difficult
for me as well.

28:21.749 --> 28:23.228
You killed my family.

28:23.229 --> 28:26.622
You killed my community.
You killed my coworkers.

28:26.623 --> 28:28.624
You killed the bees.

28:28.625 --> 28:30.539
So, given that,

28:30.540 --> 28:34.021
you should really appreciate
how super professional

28:34.022 --> 28:36.329
I'm being right now
by not gutting you.

28:47.862 --> 28:51.735
So, your sustenance
and waste disposal

28:51.736 --> 28:53.562
will be attended to
in the morning.

28:53.563 --> 28:56.478
Uh, I haven't gathered
adequate data

28:56.479 --> 28:59.525
on what type of sleep
you require, if any,

28:59.526 --> 29:01.963
but you should try
and get some, okay?

29:05.575 --> 29:07.402
I'm very sorry.

29:07.403 --> 29:11.755
I think that we maybe
got off on the wrong foot.

29:11.756 --> 29:15.672
And I would love to keep
the conversation going, please.

29:16.586 --> 29:19.675
Excuse me, please?

29:19.676 --> 29:21.590
Don. Don. Don, come on.

29:21.591 --> 29:23.680
Come on, let's keep talking.

29:24.638 --> 29:26.118
Please?

29:28.555 --> 29:29.773
Please?!

29:44.397 --> 29:46.093
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

29:48.140 --> 29:50.881
Don, Don, Don, Don!

30:19.998 --> 30:22.086
Hey.

30:22.087 --> 30:28.266
We can't see it as
a human woman, you know?

30:28.267 --> 30:31.356
It's not a person
named Michelle Fuller.

30:31.357 --> 30:34.229
It's the Fuller Humanoid.
That's all it is.

30:35.404 --> 30:38.363
Even if it was human--
and it's not--

30:38.364 --> 30:40.017
it's still evil.

30:40.018 --> 30:43.237
Pure corporate evil.

30:43.238 --> 30:46.371
It's killing our planet, cuzzie.

30:46.372 --> 30:47.981
It was the lead executive

30:47.982 --> 30:49.722
on the neonicotinoid
linked to honeybee death.

30:49.723 --> 30:51.681
It only knows cruelty.

30:54.380 --> 30:56.599
Is it an alien?

30:57.905 --> 30:59.689
Yes.

31:04.869 --> 31:06.958
It knows you're watching
right now, too.

31:08.046 --> 31:09.655
It's trying to gain
your sympathy.

31:09.656 --> 31:11.265
That shitty way
that you feel right now,

31:11.266 --> 31:12.919
that's how it wants you to feel.

31:12.920 --> 31:16.183
It's mastered the art
of emotional manipulation.

31:16.184 --> 31:17.706
I'm sorry.

31:17.707 --> 31:22.581
I-I promise
I won't mess this up, Teddy.

31:22.582 --> 31:24.758
Don't apologize, remember?

31:25.933 --> 31:28.717
We just stick to the plan.

31:28.718 --> 31:31.416
We have four days
until the lunar eclipse,

31:31.417 --> 31:34.941
when the Andromedan ship
can return undetected. Yeah?

31:34.942 --> 31:36.769
Yeah.

31:36.770 --> 31:41.600
So, we need the Fuller Humanoid
to help us make contact

31:41.601 --> 31:45.778
so we can fight
for our self-worth.

31:45.779 --> 31:48.781
For our material existence, Don.

31:48.782 --> 31:52.002
You know, I... wish
I could fix everything

31:52.003 --> 31:54.875
that's been done to you.

31:55.832 --> 31:57.877
This is not about me, Don.

32:00.011 --> 32:02.490
This is about everyone.

32:02.491 --> 32:06.843
And one day very soon,
you'll see.

32:08.758 --> 32:12.674
And the world will see you
as you truly are.

32:12.675 --> 32:14.372
A hero.

32:14.373 --> 32:18.550
That's why we stick to...

32:18.551 --> 32:22.293
We stick to...

32:22.294 --> 32:24.557
- the plan.
- Plan.

32:25.950 --> 32:28.255
- Uh...
- See? You're listening.

32:28.256 --> 32:30.215
Uh, yeah.

33:04.423 --> 33:07.251
I don't even
fucking know what's in it.

33:07.252 --> 33:10.123
I just eat the poison
they give me.

33:10.124 --> 33:12.908
But I know...

33:12.909 --> 33:15.563
they hide shit in there,

33:15.564 --> 33:19.090
to program my cells...

33:20.352 --> 33:23.006
...my blood.

33:23.007 --> 33:26.444
I see what their plan is, okay?

33:26.445 --> 33:28.881
<i>They sell me the sickness,
then they sell me the cure,</i>

33:28.882 --> 33:31.840
<i>and it's money on both sides</i>

33:31.841 --> 33:34.191
<i>from the mind control,</i>

33:34.192 --> 33:38.586
um... industry, okay?

33:38.587 --> 33:40.589
Get it?

33:41.590 --> 33:43.679
But I'll do it for you.

33:45.116 --> 33:47.205
You know, if it helps.

33:48.684 --> 33:50.425
If it makes me not like me.

33:51.426 --> 33:52.557
<i>Like I am, you know?</i>

33:52.558 --> 33:55.516
<i>Like, weak.</i>

33:55.517 --> 33:59.521
<i>Your slob, cunt mom
will do it for you, baby.</i>

34:00.609 --> 34:03.524
Just don't let them
get you, too.

34:40.997 --> 34:42.346
You can go faster.

34:42.347 --> 34:44.262
- This isn't the spa.
- Okay. Okay.

34:55.055 --> 34:56.969
PODCAST HOST [over headphones]:
With scientific evidence

34:56.970 --> 34:59.014
pointing to the potential
of other life

34:59.015 --> 35:03.018
even on our own planet
that we can't comprehend yet,

35:03.019 --> 35:05.369
and with unexplainable
phenomenon

35:05.370 --> 35:08.111
experienced by people daily
in the skies,

35:08.112 --> 35:11.375
in the oceans, and even
in their own backyard,

35:11.376 --> 35:13.768
I think it's kind of
just a little uninformed

35:13.769 --> 35:16.510
to not at least acknowledge
the potential

35:16.511 --> 35:20.732
that humankind may not be
the only intelligent life

35:20.733 --> 35:23.343
to ever exist
throughout the galaxy.

35:39.317 --> 35:40.534
...other higher-intelligent

35:40.535 --> 35:42.057
beings somewhere.

35:42.058 --> 35:44.016
I don't know if they're
coming, like I said,

35:44.017 --> 35:45.974
through the vibrations,
coming through frequencies

35:45.975 --> 35:47.672
into our world,
or if they're coming through...

35:47.673 --> 35:49.543
...trillions and billions

35:49.544 --> 35:52.067
of miles of space,
which seems kind of ridiculous

35:52.068 --> 35:53.678
when you think about it, but...

35:53.679 --> 35:55.984
- There's a whole...
-But what if it's...

35:55.985 --> 35:57.638
what if it's both
of those things?

35:57.639 --> 35:59.379
What if it's not one
or the other?

35:59.380 --> 36:01.469
It-it could be a
mixture of everything. -Yeah.

36:05.865 --> 36:07.648
Hey.

36:07.649 --> 36:09.737
Saw you there. You all right?

36:09.738 --> 36:13.001
Uh, yeah. I'm fine.

36:13.002 --> 36:15.439
- How are you?
-  I'm good.

36:15.440 --> 36:18.181
Off to work, then, or...?

36:18.182 --> 36:20.313
Uh-huh.

36:20.314 --> 36:21.880
I-I'm sorry, man.

36:21.881 --> 36:23.447
I know you're like,
"This fucking guy," right?

36:23.448 --> 36:24.578
No, no.

36:24.579 --> 36:26.232
No, it's all right. It's just...

36:26.233 --> 36:29.192
You know, we haven't had
a chance to catch up in a while,

36:29.193 --> 36:31.194
'cause, you know...

36:31.195 --> 36:33.979
all the shit, and, uh, yeah.

36:33.980 --> 36:36.199
Just wanted to check up on you.

36:36.200 --> 36:38.157
Casey, I'm good. What's up?

36:38.158 --> 36:40.333
Nothing's up, man. I just...

36:40.334 --> 36:41.943
I know I wasn't always
the best babysitter

36:41.944 --> 36:43.945
back in the day, but, um...

36:43.946 --> 36:46.253
I do want you to be okay.

36:48.821 --> 36:51.692
You still up there with Don?

36:51.693 --> 36:52.867
Yep.

36:52.868 --> 36:55.087
Great. Well, uh...

36:55.088 --> 36:56.567
I think about you sometimes.

36:56.568 --> 36:59.440
Not... not in a weird way,
just... Yeah.

37:00.789 --> 37:02.399
I'm a different guy now--
I've grown up--

37:02.400 --> 37:05.141
so if you ever need help
with anything, just...

37:06.142 --> 37:08.274
I'm good.

37:08.275 --> 37:10.407
I just gotta get to work, so...

37:10.408 --> 37:11.930
Maybe I'll stop by sometime.

37:11.931 --> 37:16.065
Yeah, I mean, I-I'm j...
I'm super busy right now.

37:17.110 --> 37:18.415
- Crazy busy.
- Right.

37:18.416 --> 37:21.244
But, um,
yeah, maybe sometime later.

37:21.245 --> 37:24.029
Later, yeah. All right.

37:24.030 --> 37:25.684
Cool. See ya.

37:26.685 --> 37:28.642
Take it easy.

37:28.643 --> 37:30.123
See ya, Teddy.

37:31.820 --> 37:33.821
HOST 2 [over headphones]: Some
people say they're all demons.

37:33.822 --> 37:36.955
A lot of people think they're
higher-intelligent beings

37:36.956 --> 37:40.524
from a different wavelength.

37:40.525 --> 37:41.873
That's a possibility,
too, I guess.

37:41.874 --> 37:43.396
I-I don't know anything.

37:43.397 --> 37:45.355
So I'm not saying, like,
one way or the other.

37:45.356 --> 37:47.400
I just, personally,
I have my opinion,

37:47.401 --> 37:49.359
and I think it's somehow
all connected.

37:49.360 --> 37:51.099
HOST 1 [over headphones]:
I think that

37:51.100 --> 37:54.538
all of those things
are each a small part of...

37:54.539 --> 37:55.887
How you doing?

37:55.888 --> 37:57.758
- What's up, man?
-Morning.

37:57.759 --> 37:59.891
HOST 2 [over headphones]:
I honestly start to believe

37:59.892 --> 38:01.806
that we're all in,
like, a simulation.

38:01.807 --> 38:03.329
And I don't want to say
it's like <i>The Matrix,</i> but...

38:09.162 --> 38:10.554
What's wrong, Tina?

38:10.555 --> 38:13.557
My frickin' hand
is still killing me.

38:13.558 --> 38:16.516
Christ. Did you file that shit
with OSHA yet?

38:16.517 --> 38:20.085
I looked into it, but I...

38:20.086 --> 38:22.914
I don't think it's a violation.

38:22.915 --> 38:26.265
Tina, their machinery cut you,

38:26.266 --> 38:28.398
and you get punished
for missing quotas?

38:28.399 --> 38:31.096
That's a... that's a violation.

38:31.097 --> 38:32.707
Fucking demons.

38:34.579 --> 38:36.798
I just don't want any trouble.

38:41.194 --> 38:42.586
Don't you worry.

38:42.587 --> 38:44.849
One day soon,
it's all gonna change.

38:44.850 --> 38:47.461
They're not gonna get away
with this shit in the end, okay?

38:48.549 --> 38:50.158
I promise you that.

38:50.159 --> 38:51.812
On Monday afternoon,

38:51.813 --> 38:54.598
following what coworkers
describe as a routine workday,

38:54.599 --> 38:58.297
Auxolith Biomedical CEO
Michelle Fuller

38:58.298 --> 39:00.908
got into her car,
passed the security gate

39:00.909 --> 39:03.781
at Auxolith headquarters
in Fayette County, Georgia,

39:03.782 --> 39:05.652
and drove towards home.

39:05.653 --> 39:07.915
That was nearly 48 hours ago.

39:07.916 --> 39:10.178
No one has heard from her since.

39:10.179 --> 39:12.529
Authorities now believe
there is a strong chance...

39:12.530 --> 39:13.921
Hey.

39:13.922 --> 39:15.314
Oh, yo. What up, Carlos?

39:15.315 --> 39:17.490
I brought some
fresh honey in for toast.

39:17.491 --> 39:18.752
Oh, great.

39:18.753 --> 39:20.450
- Thank you, Teddy.
- Yeah.

39:20.451 --> 39:22.103
A furious statewide
manhunt is now underway,

39:22.104 --> 39:24.715
with state police urging
Fayette County locals

39:24.716 --> 39:28.196
to come forward with
any information at all.

39:28.197 --> 39:30.198
Given Fuller's wealth
and high profile,

39:30.199 --> 39:32.636
state police are not ruling out
the possibility

39:32.637 --> 39:35.203
that Fuller is being held
for ransom,

39:35.204 --> 39:37.771
though, as of yet,
there is no evidence

39:37.772 --> 39:39.556
to suggest this might be
the case.

39:39.557 --> 39:41.384
The only clue authorities...

40:17.246 --> 40:19.334
Hey, cuz. Did she eat?

40:19.335 --> 40:20.727
No.

40:20.728 --> 40:22.163
Bedpan?

40:22.164 --> 40:23.514
No.

40:27.300 --> 40:30.694
Maybe she's too scared to go?

40:30.695 --> 40:32.696
No, she's not too scared to go.

40:32.697 --> 40:35.873
<i>It's trying to pity-trap
our asses.</i>

40:35.874 --> 40:37.788
<i>It's a ploy.</i>

40:37.789 --> 40:39.877
We're not gonna let it
pity-trap us, are we?

40:42.228 --> 40:43.533
No.

40:43.534 --> 40:44.969
Just stay over there.

40:44.970 --> 40:46.711
Okay, Teddy.

41:07.383 --> 41:10.908
MICHELLE [over recorder]: Um,
I am an alien from outer space.

41:10.909 --> 41:15.652
I live here on planet Earth,
but I am not a human being.

41:15.653 --> 41:18.872
My mother ship
is coming to Earth,

41:18.873 --> 41:21.745
and I would like to bring
my new friend with me.

41:21.746 --> 41:23.095
Thanks.

41:25.184 --> 41:26.576
Uh-huh.

41:26.577 --> 41:29.013
So...

41:29.014 --> 41:31.276
this is a joke, then?

41:31.277 --> 41:35.280
You're trying to simulate
sapient humor, or...

41:35.281 --> 41:37.369
That was the best I could do.

41:37.370 --> 41:38.849
This is the best you could do?

41:38.850 --> 41:40.634
You didn't even say it
in your own language.

41:42.114 --> 41:44.202
Sorry, that was the best
I could do.

41:44.203 --> 41:46.510
No, it isn't.

41:47.902 --> 41:50.774
What would you like me
to say, then?

41:50.775 --> 41:52.427
Well, I already did that.

41:52.428 --> 41:56.214
Um, I would like you
to request an audience

41:56.215 --> 41:59.173
with your emperor
to discuss the terms

41:59.174 --> 42:01.349
of your species' withdrawal
from Earth.

42:01.350 --> 42:02.568
And I did that.

42:02.569 --> 42:03.917
But convincingly.

42:03.918 --> 42:05.528
Well, that's gonna be difficult.

42:05.529 --> 42:06.878
Why?

42:08.183 --> 42:11.883
At the risk of repeating myself,
I'm not an alien.

42:18.977 --> 42:21.065
Teddy?

42:21.066 --> 42:22.719
What?

42:22.720 --> 42:26.766
I thought all night
about our situation here,

42:26.767 --> 42:28.855
and I think I know
what's going on.

42:28.856 --> 42:31.292
Okay. Yeah, please,
enlighten me.

42:31.293 --> 42:33.904
So, look, I feel qualified here

42:33.905 --> 42:36.733
because I am a chemist
by training, but I also have

42:36.734 --> 42:38.343
- a psych degree.
- Oh.

42:38.344 --> 42:40.127
Okay. Wow. Great.

42:40.128 --> 42:41.738
A degree from a university?

42:41.739 --> 42:43.435
From a credentialist scam
for laundering privilege?

42:43.436 --> 42:44.523
Amazing.

42:44.524 --> 42:46.177
Well, yeah, I do have a degree.

42:46.178 --> 42:48.919
And I also have read
a lot about this.

42:48.920 --> 42:52.400
You can't talk your way
out of this again.

42:52.401 --> 42:54.664
I'm not a kid anymore.

42:57.885 --> 43:01.540
I think you're in
a kind of echo chamber.

43:01.541 --> 43:03.673
- Echo chamber? Right now?
- Mm-hmm.

43:03.674 --> 43:05.371
Echo?

43:07.025 --> 43:10.375
Yeah, I read the same 5,000
think pieces about that, too.

43:10.376 --> 43:13.552
You're consuming content
on the Internet

43:13.553 --> 43:17.469
that is reinforcing
this sort of warped,

43:17.470 --> 43:19.471
subjective idea of reality.

43:19.472 --> 43:21.778
This is your best shot at me?

43:21.779 --> 43:24.737
Some "rabbit holes" bullshit
you read in <i>The Times?</i>

43:24.738 --> 43:26.391
Come on. Come on.

43:26.392 --> 43:28.349
Can we have a dialogue, please?

43:28.350 --> 43:30.003
Don't call it a dialogue.

43:30.004 --> 43:31.614
This isn't <i>Death of a Salesman.</i>

43:31.615 --> 43:33.485
Okay, can we talk, please?

43:33.486 --> 43:35.139
Or are-are you just gonna
keep doing this?

43:35.140 --> 43:36.706
- We don't need to talk.
- Yes, okay.

43:36.707 --> 43:38.751
Because I know exactly
what you're going to say.

43:38.752 --> 43:41.188
You're going to say
that I'm in some kind of

43:41.189 --> 43:44.975
Internet-induced autohypnotic
feedback loop,

43:44.976 --> 43:47.238
and-and gatekeepers,
and-and norms,

43:47.239 --> 43:49.632
and all that weak
hegemonic horseshit.

43:49.633 --> 43:52.243
But that is precisely
the limp-dick rhetoric

43:52.244 --> 43:53.636
that you've been instructed

43:53.637 --> 43:55.550
to counter the human
insurgency with.

43:55.551 --> 43:58.423
That's the fucking
hyper-normalized dialectic

43:58.424 --> 44:00.860
by which you've convinced
seven and a half billion people

44:00.861 --> 44:02.688
that they're not your captives.

44:02.689 --> 44:07.388
To keep us believing in these
fucking false institutional,

44:07.389 --> 44:10.653
fucking "shy-boleths."

44:10.654 --> 44:12.480
You mean shibboleths.

44:12.481 --> 44:14.134
That's what I said.

44:14.135 --> 44:15.919
- You said...
- Yeah, whatever.

44:15.920 --> 44:17.703
Sorry.

44:17.704 --> 44:20.140
I guess grammar is a false
Andromedan construct as well.

44:20.141 --> 44:22.100
Hmm?

44:28.062 --> 44:29.716
Fucking...

44:39.204 --> 44:40.684
I'm sorry.

44:42.250 --> 44:43.686
You're angry.

44:43.687 --> 44:45.905
I see that.

44:45.906 --> 44:48.125
I-I even think you have
a right to be angry.

44:48.126 --> 44:49.430
- You do?
- Yes.

44:49.431 --> 44:52.477
But we need to have
an honest talk

44:52.478 --> 44:55.741
in good faith about
what is going on here.

44:55.742 --> 44:57.830
Yes, you're right.
Let's-let's-let's talk it out.

44:57.831 --> 44:59.092
Let's create a safe space,

44:59.093 --> 45:01.834
safe words, good faith, dialogue.

45:01.835 --> 45:04.228
We need to talk about this,
we need to talk about that,

45:04.229 --> 45:06.143
and what we talk about
when we talk about

45:06.144 --> 45:07.797
fucking talk, talk, talk, talk,

45:07.798 --> 45:09.102
talk, talk, talk, talk,
talking forever

45:09.103 --> 45:11.322
until we're all fucking dead.

45:11.323 --> 45:12.671
Yeah, I agree.

45:12.672 --> 45:15.674
So, what is this exactly
that you want?

45:15.675 --> 45:17.023
Like, what do you really want?

45:17.024 --> 45:18.460
Is it money?

45:19.810 --> 45:21.898
Your capital has no value to us.

45:21.899 --> 45:24.509
So, what is it then,
a power thing?

45:24.510 --> 45:26.033
A sex thing?

45:28.427 --> 45:30.820
We have no interest
in you sexually.

45:30.821 --> 45:35.607
Irrespective of the fact that
your reproductive organs

45:35.608 --> 45:37.261
may not be compatible with ours,

45:37.262 --> 45:39.830
my cousin and I have also
been chemically castrated.

45:41.701 --> 45:43.789
Oh, Jesus Christ. Okay.

45:43.790 --> 45:46.313
But I figured you might
try to lure us in that way,

45:46.314 --> 45:48.316
hence the precaution.
See, Don?

45:53.539 --> 45:54.844
Don.

45:54.845 --> 45:56.194
Teddy.

45:57.195 --> 45:58.630
Come on.

45:58.631 --> 46:00.414
We have options here.

46:00.415 --> 46:01.851
-No.
- We do.

46:01.852 --> 46:03.113
There are no options.

46:03.114 --> 46:05.419
There are no rules.

46:05.420 --> 46:07.291
There are no deals.

46:07.292 --> 46:08.727
There's no payoff.

46:08.728 --> 46:10.294
There's no money.

46:10.295 --> 46:12.992
There is no legal system.

46:12.993 --> 46:14.428
There's no Congress.

46:14.429 --> 46:16.213
There is no America.

46:16.214 --> 46:19.912
There's no global
democratic order, okay?

46:19.913 --> 46:21.784
So don't talk to me
like I'm a dipshit,

46:21.785 --> 46:23.786
because I'm not a dipshit.

46:23.787 --> 46:25.657
I'm a guy that knows
what the fuck is happening,

46:25.658 --> 46:29.662
and you will not defeat me,
you sick Andromedan fuck!

46:32.317 --> 46:34.101
Teddy, I'm sorry.

46:35.146 --> 46:36.800
You need help.

46:38.062 --> 46:40.064
You're mentally ill.

46:49.943 --> 46:53.250
Everybody denies it at first...

46:53.251 --> 46:55.208
and then they confess.

47:12.923 --> 47:15.489
Fucking...

47:15.490 --> 47:19.319
Fucking fuck! Fucking lie!

47:19.320 --> 47:20.843
Fuck!

47:24.282 --> 47:26.065
Fuck!

48:11.982 --> 48:15.071
<i>I didn't
discover them on my own.</i>

48:15.072 --> 48:17.638
<i>I stand on the shoulders
of giants.</i>

48:17.639 --> 48:20.250
<i>The PA-99-N2 microlensing event</i>

48:20.251 --> 48:22.861
<i>proved that there was
an exoplanet.</i>

48:22.862 --> 48:26.517
<i>And Gideon55's YouTube studies

48:26.518 --> 48:28.998

48:28.999 --> 48:31.348
<i>But I was the one

48:31.349 --> 48:33.437
<i>how to identify them, okay?</i>

48:33.438 --> 48:35.569
<i>I created that content.</i>

48:35.570 --> 48:37.658
<i>Obviously, I've never been
on the ship before,</i>

48:37.659 --> 48:41.140
<i>but I know enough

48:41.141 --> 48:44.578
<i>The journey there

48:44.579 --> 48:46.580

48:56.156 --> 49:02.118
<i>They will see that we are

49:02.119 --> 49:06.905
<i>and that Earth, with its vast
resources and human ingenuity,</i>

49:06.906 --> 49:09.299
has much that we can offer.

49:09.300 --> 49:14.478
So much more than this fucking
worthless death spiral

49:14.479 --> 49:16.175
into chaos and shit.

49:16.176 --> 49:19.309
And if they won't listen
to reason,

49:19.310 --> 49:22.095
well, I have a plan
for that, too.

49:24.793 --> 49:27.709
What will our lives
be like in space?

49:29.755 --> 49:31.017
In space?

49:32.105 --> 49:34.542
Aren't we going
to live in space?

49:36.501 --> 49:38.937
Well, bud, uh...

49:38.938 --> 49:40.895
we'll only be gone
for a few hours.

49:40.896 --> 49:42.593
We're not leaving Earth
for good.

49:42.594 --> 49:45.030
We're saving it.

49:45.031 --> 49:47.990
So we have to stay here?

49:47.991 --> 49:50.644
Well, yeah. Of course.

49:50.645 --> 49:52.342
But we're saving it,

49:52.343 --> 49:55.345
so it'll be a good place
to live again.

49:55.346 --> 49:58.523
So, everything will be okay.

50:00.481 --> 50:03.048
Yeah. I know.

50:03.049 --> 50:04.789
Sorry.

50:04.790 --> 50:07.097
It's okay, man.

50:12.363 --> 50:15.322
Ever since those shots
you gave me...

50:16.367 --> 50:18.368
...I've felt weird

50:18.369 --> 50:20.500
and crazy

50:20.501 --> 50:23.764
and sometimes sad.

50:23.765 --> 50:25.941
Have you felt that way, too?

50:26.942 --> 50:29.031
It'll pass. Don't worry.

50:29.032 --> 50:30.685
Ah.

50:32.513 --> 50:33.775
It'll pass.

51:31.442 --> 51:32.964
Good morning.

51:32.965 --> 51:34.879
You're out of breath.

51:34.880 --> 51:36.533
Oh, yes.

51:36.534 --> 51:38.143
You, um...

51:38.144 --> 51:40.103
you make me nervous.

51:43.541 --> 51:47.674
Um, so, I've-I've been
doing a lot of pondering,

51:47.675 --> 51:51.288
and I think
we should start over.

51:52.680 --> 51:54.247
I want to help you.

51:55.292 --> 51:57.510
And given that,

51:57.511 --> 52:00.557
there is something that I
should have said to you earlier

52:00.558 --> 52:04.300
that I am finally prepared
to say to you now

52:04.301 --> 52:06.433
with conviction.

52:07.956 --> 52:09.784
I am an alien.

52:13.658 --> 52:15.050
I admit it.

52:16.051 --> 52:17.530
You were right all along.

52:17.531 --> 52:20.142
I am an alien.

52:20.143 --> 52:22.448
I mean, you can't blame me
for trying to conceal it

52:22.449 --> 52:24.363
for as long as I did. I...

52:24.364 --> 52:25.756
Part of my mission here on Earth

52:25.757 --> 52:28.325
is to blend in
and so forth, so...

52:31.241 --> 52:33.024
Look, I'm very tired.

52:33.025 --> 52:35.940
And I know that this doesn't...

52:35.941 --> 52:38.551
sound as forceful

52:38.552 --> 52:40.945
or the verisimilitude is not

52:40.946 --> 52:42.860
what you would want it to be,
necessarily,

52:42.861 --> 52:46.211
but I can assure you
I mean what I say.

52:46.212 --> 52:49.650
And I would like to move
forward now to a solution.

52:53.524 --> 52:55.221
I'm an alien.

53:15.546 --> 53:17.417
You want to start over?

53:18.723 --> 53:21.115
Yes.

53:21.116 --> 53:22.726
Good.

53:22.727 --> 53:24.903
Let's start over.

53:27.471 --> 53:30.473
I was hoping
we could agree on your genus

53:30.474 --> 53:33.215
and avoid a painful test,
but you forced my hand.

53:33.216 --> 53:34.999
I-I admitted it.

53:35.000 --> 53:36.653
Okay?

53:36.654 --> 53:39.046
- I admitted it.
- I'm sorry.

53:39.047 --> 53:42.312
I'm a humane person.
I-I do not want to do this.

53:43.661 --> 53:45.749
I'm an alien.

53:45.750 --> 53:47.664
I am an alien!

- What?
- I stupidly thought

you were admin.

56:51.544 --> 56:55.635
I did not realize,

56:56.810 --> 56:59.551
...you have the royal
genetic code.

57:10.389 --> 57:12.869
The most important thing I want
to stress to you right now

57:12.870 --> 57:15.132
is I never want
to put this behind us.

57:15.133 --> 57:16.264
Never.

57:17.396 --> 57:19.789
What happened is part

57:19.790 --> 57:21.138
And it doesn't go away,

57:21.139 --> 57:22.922

57:22.923 --> 57:24.315

57:24.316 --> 57:25.969
Not on my watch.

57:25.970 --> 57:27.928
This one sticks. Forever.

57:28.581 --> 57:30.539
I am putting this up

57:30.540 --> 57:32.758
on the corporate masthead
for all to see.

57:32.759 --> 57:37.068
For everyone in our company
and our industry to learn from.

57:38.025 --> 57:39.417
That's why I'm meeting

57:39.418 --> 57:40.766
all of the victims' families
this week.

57:40.767 --> 57:43.334
To let them know
we are going to do better.

57:43.335 --> 57:44.683
Maybe we don't even
try to market

57:44.684 --> 57:46.468
a product like this anymore.

57:46.469 --> 57:50.123
Or maybe, maybe we take
this experience to grow

57:50.124 --> 57:51.908
and to get this formula right.

57:51.909 --> 57:55.041
Because I really do think,
if done correctly and safely,

57:55.042 --> 57:57.609
this could be a product
that could help someone

57:57.610 --> 57:59.176
like your mom.

57:59.177 --> 58:01.874
But right now, we would like
to do what's right

58:01.875 --> 58:04.137
and cover the expenses
for your mother's treatment

58:04.138 --> 58:07.358
in hopes that her condition
might one day improve.

58:07.359 --> 58:10.230
We will not tolerate the idea
of you or your family

58:10.231 --> 58:12.058
bearing the financial burden
of this.

58:12.059 --> 58:14.408
We are covering all of it.

58:14.409 --> 58:16.149
This one's on us.

58:16.150 --> 58:18.501
And, again, we're just so sorry.

59:07.027 --> 59:08.419
You'll have to excuse me.

59:08.420 --> 59:12.423
It's my best attempt
to approximate

59:12.424 --> 59:15.861
the royal treatment
to which you are accustomed.

59:15.862 --> 59:18.603
<i>Oh, it's great. Thank you.</i>

59:18.604 --> 59:20.953
<i>There was a wig
in the bathroom.</i>

59:20.954 --> 59:22.346
<i>Did you want me to wear that?</i>

59:22.347 --> 59:23.739
<i>No, no. It's just an option.</i>

59:23.740 --> 59:24.957
<i>I'm fine.</i>

59:24.958 --> 59:26.742
<i>And I want to apologize</i>

59:26.743 --> 59:29.875
<i>for not approaching you
with proper courtesy.</i>

59:29.876 --> 59:32.312
<i>Not realizing, of course,
what you were.</i>

59:32.313 --> 59:35.185
<i>That you shared blood
with the emperor himself.</i>

59:35.186 --> 59:37.404
<i>Oh, that's
perfectly all right.</i>

59:37.405 --> 59:40.886
<i>The truth is, we will
never make progress here</i>

59:40.887 --> 59:43.889
<i>if we can't speak
eyeball to eyeball</i>

59:43.890 --> 59:46.588
<i>as the most evolved examples
of our respective species.</i>

59:46.589 --> 59:48.241
<i>I agree.</i>

59:48.242 --> 59:49.635
-<i>Good.</i>
-<i>Excellent.</i>

59:53.596 --> 59:57.251
Well, on that note, enjoy.

01:00:06.826 --> 01:00:08.219
It's a lovely home.

01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:11.351
Thank you.

01:00:11.352 --> 01:00:13.310
Mmm.

01:00:13.311 --> 01:00:14.703
Just you here?

01:00:14.704 --> 01:00:16.792
Yes.

01:00:16.793 --> 01:00:18.446
Always?

01:00:19.709 --> 01:00:20.839
Sorry?

01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:23.233
Has-has it always just been you?

01:00:23.234 --> 01:00:25.844
Um, well...

01:00:25.845 --> 01:00:29.935
I'd prefer if we didn't delve
too deeply into the personal,

01:00:29.936 --> 01:00:31.371
if you don't mind.

01:00:31.372 --> 01:00:32.764
Mmm.

01:00:32.765 --> 01:00:34.461
Sure, that's fine.

01:00:34.462 --> 01:00:36.029
Thank you.

01:00:39.642 --> 01:00:41.294
So, what...

01:00:41.295 --> 01:00:44.210
Why don't you tell me more
about your movement?

01:00:44.211 --> 01:00:45.864
My what?

01:00:45.865 --> 01:00:47.954
Your movement.
What you're doing.

01:00:50.130 --> 01:00:54.133
Respectfully,
we are not a movement.

01:00:54.134 --> 01:00:55.613
Oh.

01:00:55.614 --> 01:00:58.268
A movement is made up
of many people.

01:00:58.269 --> 01:01:00.010
I did this all on my own.

01:01:01.054 --> 01:01:02.446
Of course.

01:01:02.447 --> 01:01:05.144
With the help of my colleague,
of course.

01:01:05.145 --> 01:01:06.450
Well, it's very impressive.

01:01:06.451 --> 01:01:07.712
-Thank you.
-I'm...

01:01:07.713 --> 01:01:11.324
I'm all for people
who can do that.

01:01:11.325 --> 01:01:14.807
You know, the activism thing.

01:01:16.766 --> 01:01:19.724
99.9% of what's called activism

01:01:19.725 --> 01:01:22.248
is really personal exhibitionism

01:01:22.249 --> 01:01:25.643
and brand maintenance
in disguise.

01:01:25.644 --> 01:01:27.689
Mmm. Okay.

01:01:27.690 --> 01:01:29.692
I used to be the same way.

01:01:31.302 --> 01:01:35.479
I ran through the whole
digestive tract in...

01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:37.481
five years?

01:01:37.482 --> 01:01:42.094
Alt-right, alt-lite,
leftist, Marxist.

01:01:42.095 --> 01:01:44.618
All those stupid badges.

01:01:44.619 --> 01:01:47.883
I went shopping hungry, and I
just bought the whole store.

01:01:49.189 --> 01:01:51.408
Mmm.

01:01:51.409 --> 01:01:54.063
But I was just looking
in the wrong places.

01:01:54.064 --> 01:01:57.849
Until I discovered you.

01:01:57.850 --> 01:02:00.504
Well, again,
it is very impressive.

01:02:00.505 --> 01:02:02.855
Thank you.

01:02:04.248 --> 01:02:06.249
You as well, Don.

01:02:06.250 --> 01:02:08.251
- Um...
-You'll...

01:02:08.252 --> 01:02:09.731
You'll have to excuse
my colleague.

01:02:09.732 --> 01:02:11.602
He prefers not to converse.

01:02:11.603 --> 01:02:14.170
Uh, can I go to the bathroom?

01:02:14.171 --> 01:02:16.476
In just a minute, Don.

01:02:16.477 --> 01:02:18.349
We're eating right now.

01:02:23.136 --> 01:02:25.181
I see you're apiarists.

01:02:25.182 --> 01:02:26.704
Of sorts.

01:02:26.705 --> 01:02:28.140
I've taken an interest as well.

01:02:28.141 --> 01:02:30.273
Hmm. So I've heard.

01:02:30.274 --> 01:02:32.449
Magnificent
creatures, honeybees.

01:02:32.450 --> 01:02:33.885
Very much so.

01:02:33.886 --> 01:02:36.888
Earth's most admirable creation.

01:02:36.889 --> 01:02:40.414
Well, shit, I've literally said
those exact words before.

01:02:45.637 --> 01:02:49.684
Right, so, um, what is it
that you admire about them?

01:02:51.948 --> 01:02:54.080
About bees? Uh...

01:02:55.429 --> 01:02:56.952
Complex society.

01:02:56.953 --> 01:02:58.518
Work ethic.

01:02:58.519 --> 01:03:00.216
They do their duty,
they build their worlds

01:03:00.217 --> 01:03:04.787
without complaint or piety
or self-obsession.

01:03:07.441 --> 01:03:08.702
Mm-hmm.

01:03:08.703 --> 01:03:10.140
All true.

01:03:13.012 --> 01:03:17.973
Which is why they're so easy
to exploit, right?

01:03:17.974 --> 01:03:20.845
I just admire their resolve.
That's all.

01:03:20.846 --> 01:03:22.805
Even in the face of peril.

01:03:23.762 --> 01:03:25.590
Well, we can agree on that.

01:03:31.074 --> 01:03:33.162
What sort of peril, by the way?

01:03:33.163 --> 01:03:34.554
Sorry?

01:03:34.555 --> 01:03:37.079
You said bees have faced peril.

01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:38.646
Such as?

01:03:39.952 --> 01:03:41.605
Uh, what do you want me to say?

01:03:41.606 --> 01:03:44.260
Well, just say it.

01:03:44.261 --> 01:03:46.610
- Why don't you say it?
- Nah, you should just say it.

01:03:46.611 --> 01:03:48.177
You go ahead.

01:03:48.178 --> 01:03:49.569
No, I insist.

01:03:49.570 --> 01:03:52.443
No, please. After you.

01:03:53.792 --> 01:03:57.100
Colony collapse disorder.

01:04:02.888 --> 01:04:05.324
Sure, Teddy. Like CCD.

01:04:05.325 --> 01:04:07.631
You're a bit of an expert
on CCD.

01:04:07.632 --> 01:04:10.329
Well, I... I wouldn't
say that exactly.

01:04:10.330 --> 01:04:12.985
Well, I would say that exactly.

01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:16.553
It's all right.
We're just talking.

01:04:16.554 --> 01:04:19.861
So, I take it you're referring
to the neonicotinoids

01:04:19.862 --> 01:04:22.167
that my company makes.

01:04:22.168 --> 01:04:24.082
You know what? Let's just...
let's just leave it.

01:04:24.083 --> 01:04:26.606
No, I-I appreciate your concern.

01:04:26.607 --> 01:04:30.436
I just think your research
is a bit out of date, Teddy.

01:04:30.437 --> 01:04:33.135
Uh, CCD has declined
significantly in recent years.

01:04:33.136 --> 01:04:35.267
The bees are coming back.

01:04:35.268 --> 01:04:37.226
And there's no consensus

01:04:37.227 --> 01:04:41.404
that pesticides were ever
a real threat to begin with.

01:04:41.405 --> 01:04:45.669
Yes, I'm well aware of what
you've all been telling us.

01:04:45.670 --> 01:04:47.889
Thank you.

01:04:47.890 --> 01:04:53.198
I know you want there
to be a master plan, Teddy.

01:04:53.199 --> 01:04:57.637
You want the bees to be dying
so that it can be my fault

01:04:57.638 --> 01:04:59.770
and you don't have to think
about the real reasons

01:04:59.771 --> 01:05:01.164
why species die.

01:05:02.295 --> 01:05:05.776
Immunodeficiencies,
changing habitats,

01:05:05.777 --> 01:05:08.387
genetic factors.

01:05:08.388 --> 01:05:11.173
Or sometimes a species
just winds down.

01:05:12.436 --> 01:05:14.176
"Winds down"?

01:05:14.177 --> 01:05:17.005
Maybe something clicks
in their heads

01:05:17.006 --> 01:05:20.357
and they just know
or they intuit.

01:05:21.532 --> 01:05:25.057
The futility of
the entire enterprise.

01:05:26.102 --> 01:05:28.320
Who knows, right?

01:05:28.321 --> 01:05:30.279
Right. Who knows?

01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:33.412
-That's right.
- So hard to say.

01:05:34.501 --> 01:05:35.938
Who knows, Don?

01:05:40.072 --> 01:05:42.247
We were having a nice dinner.

01:05:42.248 --> 01:05:43.509
We were.

01:05:43.510 --> 01:05:47.036
Nice, quiet, respectful.

01:05:48.037 --> 01:05:49.994
But now we're not.

01:05:49.995 --> 01:05:51.213
No, we're not.

01:05:51.214 --> 01:05:53.825
And why do suppose that is?

01:05:55.522 --> 01:05:57.132
You tell me.

01:05:57.133 --> 01:05:58.916
Because you're lying to me.

01:05:58.917 --> 01:06:00.526
Are you sure
I can't use the bathr...

01:06:00.527 --> 01:06:02.572
Shh!

01:06:02.573 --> 01:06:04.662
Your usual conclusion.

01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:08.360
You're murdering the bees.

01:06:08.361 --> 01:06:09.492
I am not.

01:06:09.493 --> 01:06:12.147
And now you're lying again.

01:06:12.148 --> 01:06:13.496
- Lies.
- Lies.

01:06:13.497 --> 01:06:15.889
- Truth.
- Lies.

01:06:15.890 --> 01:06:18.240
What's the difference?

01:06:18.241 --> 01:06:19.632
I can't change your mind.

01:06:19.633 --> 01:06:21.591
You're right, you can't.

01:06:21.592 --> 01:06:24.507
Because I know who you are.

01:06:24.508 --> 01:06:26.379
I know what you are.

01:06:27.946 --> 01:06:30.731
I know you, too, Teddy.

01:06:32.168 --> 01:06:34.256
Bullshit you do.

01:06:34.257 --> 01:06:36.562
I do.

01:06:36.563 --> 01:06:38.086
You know how I know?

01:06:38.087 --> 01:06:39.610
Fuck you.

01:06:41.525 --> 01:06:43.657
Sandy Gatz.

01:06:46.443 --> 01:06:48.532
What did you say?

01:06:50.186 --> 01:06:52.057
I remember, Teddy.

01:06:53.493 --> 01:06:55.974
That was your mother. Right?

01:06:57.671 --> 01:06:59.237
She is my mother.

01:06:59.238 --> 01:07:00.847
Right, yes. Of course.

01:07:00.848 --> 01:07:03.111
I'm sorry.

01:07:03.112 --> 01:07:05.678
And you will never
say her name again.

01:07:05.679 --> 01:07:07.071
Understand?

01:07:07.072 --> 01:07:08.726
That's fair enough.

01:07:09.857 --> 01:07:12.076
But I do think
we need to discuss...

01:07:12.077 --> 01:07:13.469
W-We actually do not

01:07:13.470 --> 01:07:15.732
because this is not about that.

01:07:15.733 --> 01:07:17.690
With all due respect, Teddy,

01:07:17.691 --> 01:07:19.997
how could this
not be about that?

01:07:19.998 --> 01:07:22.043
We believed
we were helping, Teddy.

01:07:22.044 --> 01:07:23.696
Don't you dare.

01:07:23.697 --> 01:07:26.395
Opioid withdrawal
medication like that

01:07:26.396 --> 01:07:28.136
could've helped your mother

01:07:28.137 --> 01:07:30.486
- and millions like her.
- Stop. Just stop.

01:07:30.487 --> 01:07:33.837
And the clinical trial pay,
that was helping her, too.

01:07:33.838 --> 01:07:36.274
I know it wasn't
a king's ransom, but it...

01:07:36.275 --> 01:07:38.059
Stop right now.

01:07:38.060 --> 01:07:41.105
Obviously, we did not foresee
the complications

01:07:41.106 --> 01:07:43.064
for Sandy or for the others.

01:07:43.065 --> 01:07:44.239
Do not say her name.

01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:45.979
You do not say her name.

01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:48.765
We believed we paid your family
a proper reparation,

01:07:48.766 --> 01:07:51.072
but now I see
it wasn't nearly enough.

01:07:51.073 --> 01:07:52.595
- Stop!
- Not by half,

01:07:52.596 --> 01:07:53.857
not by a fraction.

01:07:53.858 --> 01:07:55.250
- Stop!
- Teddy...

01:07:55.251 --> 01:07:57.208
you're right to distrust me,
you are.

01:07:57.209 --> 01:07:59.602
- I lost myself somewhere, okay?
- Fuck you.

01:07:59.603 --> 01:08:01.169
- Shut the fuck up.
- I...

01:08:01.170 --> 01:08:03.388
I became a human being

01:08:03.389 --> 01:08:04.868
that I told myself
I would never become.

01:08:04.869 --> 01:08:06.739
- Fuck you!
- I'm not denying that,

01:08:06.740 --> 01:08:08.306
but I can help you, Teddy.

01:08:08.307 --> 01:08:09.960
I can still help you.

01:08:09.961 --> 01:08:11.788
And I can still help
your mother.

01:08:11.789 --> 01:08:13.485
I can help her.

01:08:13.486 --> 01:08:14.747
Truly, I can.

01:08:14.748 --> 01:08:16.923
I-I... I mean,

01:08:16.924 --> 01:08:19.013
can you?

01:08:19.971 --> 01:08:21.407
You needed a mother.

01:08:22.495 --> 01:08:23.756
She was never there for you.

01:08:23.757 --> 01:08:25.018
Fucking die, you fucker!

01:08:30.416 --> 01:08:32.113
Fucking kill you!

01:08:32.114 --> 01:08:33.854
I'll fucking kill you!

01:08:38.337 --> 01:08:40.121
Teddy, stop.

01:08:46.737 --> 01:08:48.260
Teddy, stop.

01:09:44.708 --> 01:09:46.187
Get off him!

01:09:46.188 --> 01:09:47.840
You can't beat me,
because you are a loser

01:09:47.841 --> 01:09:49.364
and I am a winner.

01:09:49.365 --> 01:09:50.931
And that's fucking life.

01:10:58.260 --> 01:10:59.608
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:10:59.609 --> 01:11:01.044
How annoying is this, right?

01:11:01.045 --> 01:11:02.567
- No, what's up?
- Mmm.

01:11:02.568 --> 01:11:04.047
No, come on, dude. I know.

01:11:04.048 --> 01:11:05.440
It's like,
"Why'd I even tell this guy

01:11:05.441 --> 01:11:07.180
he could stop by," right?

01:11:07.181 --> 01:11:08.704
It's fine, Casey. What's up?

01:11:08.705 --> 01:11:10.488
Um, sorry.

01:11:10.489 --> 01:11:12.664
I-I actually do have a real
reason to be here, though.

01:11:12.665 --> 01:11:14.231
Uh-huh.

01:11:14.232 --> 01:11:16.364
Um, well, you know how
we're all working

01:11:16.365 --> 01:11:18.149
this missing persons thing?

01:11:19.716 --> 01:11:21.369
Uh, yeah,

01:11:21.370 --> 01:11:23.546
I just had a couple questions
to run by you, actually.

01:11:24.503 --> 01:11:25.677
Don't worry.

01:11:25.678 --> 01:11:27.766
Obviously, I just, um...

01:11:27.767 --> 01:11:30.509
Sorry, could I actually
come in, maybe?

01:11:31.554 --> 01:11:32.902
Uh, yeah. No, sure.

01:11:32.903 --> 01:11:34.512
Come on in.

01:11:34.513 --> 01:11:36.167
Dude, thank you.
I really appreciate that.

01:11:43.305 --> 01:11:44.827
We are not alone.

01:11:44.828 --> 01:11:46.350
Huh?

01:11:46.351 --> 01:11:48.657
Nothing. Just, you know,

01:11:48.658 --> 01:11:50.311
"We are not alone."

01:11:50.312 --> 01:11:51.660
Oh, right.

01:11:51.661 --> 01:11:53.314
Well, we're not.

01:11:53.315 --> 01:11:54.706
- Uh...
-Right.

01:11:54.707 --> 01:11:56.665
You want some water or...

01:11:56.666 --> 01:11:59.145
That'd be great. Thank you.

01:12:00.539 --> 01:12:02.714
Gotta tell you, man, it's, uh,

01:12:02.715 --> 01:12:04.804
pretty weird being back in here.

01:12:05.979 --> 01:12:07.764
A lot of feelings.

01:12:12.203 --> 01:12:14.726
Yeah, well, same old shit.

01:12:14.727 --> 01:12:16.119
Hmm.

01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:18.034
Thank you.

01:12:18.035 --> 01:12:20.732
Scared the, uh,
chair's gonna run away?

01:12:20.733 --> 01:12:22.344
What?

01:12:24.998 --> 01:12:27.609
Oh. No.

01:12:27.610 --> 01:12:30.742
My mom, she used to have
fits or whatever,

01:12:30.743 --> 01:12:32.658
so we'd-we'd nail
the chair down.

01:12:34.051 --> 01:12:35.357
Yeah.

01:12:37.228 --> 01:12:38.750
Uh-oh.

01:12:38.751 --> 01:12:40.622
What?

01:12:40.623 --> 01:12:42.494
My archnemesis.

01:12:44.409 --> 01:12:46.279
Ah.

01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:48.586
You want a piece of cake?

01:12:48.587 --> 01:12:50.762
I mean, if you insist.

01:12:52.417 --> 01:12:55.201
Yeah, I love this stuff.

01:13:01.252 --> 01:13:03.558
So, um, you had
some questions or...?

01:13:03.559 --> 01:13:05.821
Oh. Uh, yeah, sorry.

01:13:05.822 --> 01:13:07.649
Um, you're still
at Auxolith, right?

01:13:07.650 --> 01:13:09.172
Yeah.

01:13:09.173 --> 01:13:11.783
So you must know all about
the Fuller case?

01:13:11.784 --> 01:13:14.395
I mean, I heard a little, yeah.

01:13:14.396 --> 01:13:15.918
On the news?

01:13:15.919 --> 01:13:18.094
I don't get the news
from the news.

01:13:18.095 --> 01:13:19.791
Right. Um, of course. Sorry.

01:13:19.792 --> 01:13:21.358
I'm just here on a hunch, really.

01:13:21.359 --> 01:13:23.273
See, this missing lady,
her phone

01:13:23.274 --> 01:13:25.449
pinged a cell tower in the area
the night of the abduction.

01:13:25.450 --> 01:13:26.798
Thank you. Thank you very much.

01:13:26.799 --> 01:13:28.409
Oh.

01:13:28.410 --> 01:13:30.933
Well, those things have
a pretty wide radius,

01:13:30.934 --> 01:13:33.326
- though, right?
- Yeah, no, for sure.

01:13:33.327 --> 01:13:36.242
It's just that her car was
also snapped by a speed trap

01:13:36.243 --> 01:13:38.941
near the intersection
down the road over here.

01:13:38.942 --> 01:13:40.291
Oh, yeah?

01:13:41.335 --> 01:13:42.988
I know. I'm, uh...

01:13:42.989 --> 01:13:44.686
You know, long shot, right?

01:13:44.687 --> 01:13:47.036
But, I don't know,
it's a sparsely populated area.

01:13:47.037 --> 01:13:48.907
Figured I'd check in
with the local residents.

01:13:48.908 --> 01:13:52.912
See if, uh, you or Don
seen anything peculiar.

01:13:53.870 --> 01:13:55.348
Uh...

01:13:55.349 --> 01:13:57.394
No, no.

01:13:57.395 --> 01:13:58.917
Well, uh, hmm.

01:13:58.918 --> 01:14:00.832
Let's see here.

01:14:00.833 --> 01:14:04.271
For starters, have you seen...

01:14:05.664 --> 01:14:08.013
...this car?

01:14:08.014 --> 01:14:09.667
Uh-uh.

01:14:09.668 --> 01:14:13.367
What about, uh, this woman?

01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:17.283
I mean, yeah,
she-she owns my work, yeah.

01:14:17.284 --> 01:14:18.850
But I haven't seen her, no.

01:14:18.851 --> 01:14:20.286
You haven't seen her in person?

01:14:20.287 --> 01:14:21.418
No.

01:14:21.419 --> 01:14:24.465
I scan packages, so I wouldn't.

01:14:24.466 --> 01:14:26.336
No, no. Dude, I-I know.
I'm-I'm sorry.

01:14:26.337 --> 01:14:28.251
Um, how about your neighbors?

01:14:28.252 --> 01:14:30.122
They say anything about,
I don't know,

01:14:30.123 --> 01:14:32.951
any out-of-the-ordinary
activity?

01:14:32.952 --> 01:14:35.477
Uh, I mean,
I don't know them, really.

01:14:36.739 --> 01:14:38.435
Right. I-I'm sorry, man.

01:14:38.436 --> 01:14:41.570
Uh, I'm really grasping
at straws here.

01:14:42.962 --> 01:14:44.833
Uh...

01:14:44.834 --> 01:14:48.227
Look, I mainly just wanted
to check up on you, man.

01:14:48.228 --> 01:14:50.012
I know the last thing you want

01:14:50.013 --> 01:14:52.797
is for your fucked-up
babysitter from 20 years ago

01:14:52.798 --> 01:14:57.367
stopping by,
feeling guilty about, um...

01:14:57.368 --> 01:15:01.110
you know, whatever
went down, uh, but...

01:15:01.111 --> 01:15:02.851
Sometimes I pass by this place,

01:15:02.852 --> 01:15:08.247
and I just get this fucking
sad, awful feeling, like,

01:15:08.248 --> 01:15:10.207
"What's going on in there?"

01:15:11.643 --> 01:15:13.252
You know?

01:15:13.253 --> 01:15:14.906
Not much.

01:15:26.092 --> 01:15:27.484
Where is he?

01:15:38.322 --> 01:15:39.409
Don?

01:15:39.410 --> 01:15:42.107
Look at me, Don.

01:15:42.108 --> 01:15:43.674
Put the gun down.

01:15:43.675 --> 01:15:45.154
Look at me.

01:15:45.155 --> 01:15:47.418
I know you would never hurt me.

01:16:02.085 --> 01:16:05.087
Thank you, Don.

01:16:05.088 --> 01:16:09.483
You could've shot me earlier
upstairs, but you didn't.

01:16:12.225 --> 01:16:15.533
How you behaved
was honestly heroic.

01:16:17.056 --> 01:16:19.276
I don't use that word lightly.

01:16:20.582 --> 01:16:22.800
You have been the only thing
stopping him

01:16:22.801 --> 01:16:25.586
from doing God knows what to me.

01:16:25.587 --> 01:16:28.067
I don't talk to you.

01:16:29.155 --> 01:16:31.896
That's how it is.

01:16:31.897 --> 01:16:34.420
So stay quiet.

01:16:34.421 --> 01:16:36.510
But you know
this is crazy, right?

01:16:37.903 --> 01:16:40.252
You know this is wrong.

01:16:40.253 --> 01:16:41.776
I know you know that.

01:16:41.777 --> 01:16:42.994
Shut up.

01:16:42.995 --> 01:16:44.866
I'm just saying.

01:16:44.867 --> 01:16:46.868
There is a world, Don.

01:16:46.869 --> 01:16:49.871
There is a world
where we help you

01:16:49.872 --> 01:16:52.351
and your cousin and your aunt,

01:16:52.352 --> 01:16:56.573
where reparations are paid
and a page is turned.

01:16:56.574 --> 01:16:59.010
All of that can happen for you.

01:16:59.011 --> 01:17:01.056
No. You're...

01:17:01.057 --> 01:17:03.406
You're gonna get
me and Teddy arrested.

01:17:03.407 --> 01:17:05.103
No, I wouldn't.

01:17:05.104 --> 01:17:07.802
And-and if you're right
and Teddy gets arrested,

01:17:07.803 --> 01:17:11.632
it's... it'll all be different
for you, Don.

01:17:11.633 --> 01:17:14.504
It will, if you let me go.

01:17:14.505 --> 01:17:15.679
Stop.

01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:17.639
I know what you're doing.

01:17:19.858 --> 01:17:25.081
All he does is drag you deeper
and deeper into a pit.

01:17:26.473 --> 01:17:29.519
He never actually offers you
a way out for you.

01:17:30.826 --> 01:17:34.002
I can do that for you, Don.

01:17:34.003 --> 01:17:35.699
I want to do that for you.

01:17:35.700 --> 01:17:38.441
I said, shut up!

01:17:38.442 --> 01:17:39.921
It's okay.

01:17:39.922 --> 01:17:42.837
I know you're confused
and frustrated.

01:17:42.838 --> 01:17:46.754
No one in the universe
could possibly blame you.

01:17:46.755 --> 01:17:48.625
Shut up.

01:17:48.626 --> 01:17:50.192
Put the gun down.

01:17:50.193 --> 01:17:51.933
Just talk to me.

01:17:51.934 --> 01:17:53.325
No.

01:17:53.326 --> 01:17:55.240
Sit down and talk to me.
Put the gun down.

01:17:55.241 --> 01:17:59.897
Just shut up, alien filth.

01:17:59.898 --> 01:18:02.292
He ever show up again?

01:18:05.904 --> 01:18:07.949
Fucking asshole.

01:18:07.950 --> 01:18:10.430
Sorry. I know he's your dad
and you probably love him.

01:18:11.605 --> 01:18:13.738
I literally
wouldn't recognize him.

01:18:17.699 --> 01:18:21.266
Look, Teddy, um...

01:18:21.267 --> 01:18:24.662
I know it was a long time ago,
what I did to you, man.

01:18:25.619 --> 01:18:26.707
It's fine.

01:18:26.708 --> 01:18:28.447
No. It wasn't fine.

01:18:28.448 --> 01:18:30.493
It-it was wrong,
but I promise you,

01:18:30.494 --> 01:18:32.234
it's-it's not 'cause I liked it.

01:18:32.235 --> 01:18:33.844
It was just...

01:18:33.845 --> 01:18:35.063
you know, probably
some weird power thing.

01:18:35.064 --> 01:18:38.327
I was... I was young
and lost, and...

01:18:38.328 --> 01:18:42.635
I promise you, dude, I never,
ever did that to anybody else.

01:18:42.636 --> 01:18:45.073
Just forget it. It's done.

01:18:45.074 --> 01:18:46.378
Seriously.

01:18:46.379 --> 01:18:49.251
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

01:18:53.909 --> 01:18:54.909
Hey, you should read this.

01:18:54.910 --> 01:18:57.042
This shit helped me a lot.

01:18:58.783 --> 01:19:00.350
Thank you, dude.

01:19:01.351 --> 01:19:03.570
Hey, you want to see my bees?

01:19:05.747 --> 01:19:08.226
Someone's up there, right?

01:19:08.227 --> 01:19:11.055
Shut up.

01:19:11.056 --> 01:19:12.753
Is it the police?

01:19:12.754 --> 01:19:15.103
I said, shut up.

01:19:15.104 --> 01:19:16.931
It is.

01:19:16.932 --> 01:19:19.890
And, Don, they're gonna
arrest your cousin.

01:19:19.891 --> 01:19:22.153
But it is not too late for you.

01:19:22.154 --> 01:19:25.287
Please, stop.

01:19:25.288 --> 01:19:27.637
If you let me go right now,

01:19:27.638 --> 01:19:29.813
everything will work out
for you.

01:19:29.814 --> 01:19:31.075
No, it won't.

01:19:31.076 --> 01:19:33.122
It will, Don.

01:19:34.427 --> 01:19:35.819
I promise.

01:19:35.820 --> 01:19:37.386
You don't understand.

01:19:37.387 --> 01:19:39.780
There's nothing left for me.

01:19:39.781 --> 01:19:42.305
Teddy is all I have.

01:19:43.349 --> 01:19:46.482
We'll find something else
for you.

01:19:46.483 --> 01:19:47.831
You don't need him.

01:19:47.832 --> 01:19:49.964
Yes, I do.

01:19:49.965 --> 01:19:51.880
I love him.

01:19:53.272 --> 01:19:55.578
Sorry I couldn't
help you find that lady.

01:19:55.579 --> 01:19:56.797
It's all right, man.

01:20:05.067 --> 01:20:06.328
I got it.

01:20:06.329 --> 01:20:07.764
Thanks.

01:20:07.765 --> 01:20:10.159
- Be gentle.
- Yep, yep.

01:20:16.208 --> 01:20:20.429
There is so much else
out there, Don.

01:20:20.430 --> 01:20:22.387
No, there's not.

01:20:22.388 --> 01:20:23.998
Not here.

01:20:23.999 --> 01:20:25.390
Then where?

01:20:25.391 --> 01:20:28.176
Where do you want to go, Don?

01:20:28.177 --> 01:20:29.655
We can go there.

01:20:29.656 --> 01:20:31.267
I'll take you there.

01:20:32.398 --> 01:20:35.487
If you are an alien,
will you help me?

01:20:35.488 --> 01:20:38.839
Don, that's enough of that.
Please.

01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:40.362
You know I'm not an alien.

01:20:40.363 --> 01:20:41.972
You know that.

01:20:41.973 --> 01:20:46.456
But if you are,
would you take me with you?

01:20:47.849 --> 01:20:49.240
What?

01:20:49.241 --> 01:20:51.068
If all of this is true

01:20:51.069 --> 01:20:54.550
and you have a sh-- spaceship,

01:20:54.551 --> 01:20:57.423
would you take me away
from here?

01:21:00.905 --> 01:21:03.037
Of course, Don.

01:21:03.038 --> 01:21:04.822
Yes, absolutely.

01:21:05.779 --> 01:21:07.564
I'll take you with me.

01:21:08.608 --> 01:21:11.132
We'll leave Earth.

01:21:11.133 --> 01:21:14.092
I promise
that's what'll happen, okay?

01:21:15.311 --> 01:21:17.008
If you let me go.

01:21:20.794 --> 01:21:22.578
Thank you...

01:21:22.579 --> 01:21:24.754
but not without Teddy.

01:21:24.755 --> 01:21:27.322
Please, Don,
we don't have much time.

01:21:27.323 --> 01:21:29.411
Th-They're gonna break in here
at any minute,

01:21:29.412 --> 01:21:31.935
and then I won't be able
to help you.

01:21:35.026 --> 01:21:36.549
Come on.

01:21:49.736 --> 01:21:51.259
Okay.

01:21:51.260 --> 01:21:53.479
I'm ready to leave.

01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:56.220
Okay.

01:21:56.221 --> 01:22:00.050
Can you do one thing for me?

01:22:00.051 --> 01:22:05.796
Tell Teddy that I'm sorry
and that I love him.

01:22:07.711 --> 01:22:09.452
I will.

01:22:16.415 --> 01:22:18.242
The fuck?

01:22:22.856 --> 01:22:25.772
Jesus fucking Christ.

01:22:27.035 --> 01:22:29.384
Fuck.

01:22:57.761 --> 01:22:59.283
Don?

01:22:59.284 --> 01:23:01.199
Don!

01:23:03.288 --> 01:23:04.723
Jesus!

01:23:04.724 --> 01:23:06.160
Don.

01:23:06.161 --> 01:23:07.944
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:23:07.945 --> 01:23:09.728
I swear to you,
he did it to himself.

01:23:09.729 --> 01:23:11.165
He thought the police were
coming... -Don. No, no, no.

01:23:11.166 --> 01:23:12.427
...and he panicked,
and he just freaked out.

01:23:12.428 --> 01:23:13.732
Teddy, no. No.

01:23:13.733 --> 01:23:15.299
- What did you say to him?
- Nothing.

01:23:16.998 --> 01:23:20.217
What fucking filth did you
fill his sad brain with,

01:23:20.218 --> 01:23:21.610
you demon from hell?

01:23:21.611 --> 01:23:23.742
He was under
extreme pressure, Teddy.

01:23:23.743 --> 01:23:26.093
- He cracked.
- And you cracked him!

01:23:26.094 --> 01:23:28.486
You poisoned his heart
with lies and bullshit

01:23:28.487 --> 01:23:31.011
until his whole fucking world
collapsed, didn't you?

01:23:31.012 --> 01:23:33.056
You fed him
a fucking fairy tale.

01:23:33.057 --> 01:23:35.145
He did all of this for you,
you fucking maniac.

01:23:35.146 --> 01:23:36.799
Don't kill me, Teddy.

01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:39.846
I have a cure for your mother.

01:23:40.804 --> 01:23:43.153
- What?
- There's a cure.

01:23:43.154 --> 01:23:45.504
You can save her.

01:23:46.592 --> 01:23:47.897
What are you saying?

01:23:47.898 --> 01:23:50.073
Inside of her,

01:23:50.074 --> 01:23:52.032
a big change is taking place.

01:23:52.033 --> 01:23:54.860
It's an entire rearranging

01:23:54.861 --> 01:23:57.037
<i>of her genetic code.</i>

01:23:57.038 --> 01:23:58.951
<i>She was the first sample.</i>

01:23:58.952 --> 01:24:00.649
<i>It's a very important
Andromedan experiment,</i>

01:24:00.650 --> 01:24:02.651
<i>and it takes
four to five years.</i>

01:24:02.652 --> 01:24:04.653
<i>But if it succeeds,
she will wake up.</i>

01:24:04.654 --> 01:24:06.916
Well, what if
it doesn't succeed?

01:24:06.917 --> 01:24:08.613
Then she'll die.

01:24:08.614 --> 01:24:10.963
But if we chemically terminate
the experiment,

01:24:10.964 --> 01:24:13.053
she will wake up,
she'll wake up.

01:24:13.054 --> 01:24:15.751
Well, how...
how-how do we do that?

01:24:15.752 --> 01:24:17.579
- You have my car?
- Yes.

01:24:17.580 --> 01:24:19.668
Okay. So, in my car,

01:24:19.669 --> 01:24:23.411
in the trunk, in the back,
there is a bottle.

01:24:23.412 --> 01:24:27.023
It's a yellow jug, and it says
"monoethylene glycol."

01:24:27.024 --> 01:24:28.677
Antifreeze.
But forget the label.

01:24:28.678 --> 01:24:30.244
It's not antifreeze.
It's the cure.

01:24:30.245 --> 01:24:33.290
I keep it in my car,
in the trunk,

01:24:33.291 --> 01:24:36.119
in the antifreeze jug
to hide it.

01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:37.643
For safety.

01:24:40.081 --> 01:24:42.038
<i>If...</i>

01:24:42.039 --> 01:24:44.693
<i>i-if this experiment
is so important,</i>

01:24:44.694 --> 01:24:47.174
<i>why would you allow me
to cancel it? Huh?</i>

01:24:47.175 --> 01:24:49.219
<i>There are multiple experiments</i>

01:24:49.220 --> 01:24:51.092
<i>happening all over the world--
your mother's one of dozens.</i>

01:24:52.397 --> 01:24:53.615
<i>Just trust me.</i>

01:24:53.616 --> 01:24:54.964
I'm chained up here.

01:24:54.965 --> 01:24:57.227
I have no way of escaping.
Why would I lie?

01:25:05.932 --> 01:25:07.324
-  -
- That's for Don,

01:25:07.325 --> 01:25:08.847
you fucking virus.

01:27:43.046 --> 01:27:45.440
It's not antifreeze, Mom.

01:27:46.615 --> 01:27:48.573
Don't worry.

01:28:28.657 --> 01:28:30.876
Wake up, Mom. Wake up.

01:28:33.052 --> 01:28:35.184
Come on. Come on.

01:28:40.712 --> 01:28:42.147
Please, Mom. Please.

01:28:42.148 --> 01:28:44.280
Come on, come on. Wake up.

01:29:10.046 --> 01:29:11.352
Come on.

01:29:48.650 --> 01:29:49.780
Mom?

01:29:49.781 --> 01:29:50.999
Wake up.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.044
You can do it.

01:29:53.045 --> 01:29:54.830
Wake up.

01:30:06.363 --> 01:30:08.583
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

01:30:18.984 --> 01:30:20.463
NURSE [in distance]:
201, now!

01:30:37.655 --> 01:30:39.614
Hey! Hey!

01:30:40.658 --> 01:30:41.963
Hey!

01:31:13.909 --> 01:31:16.650
You fucking monster.

01:31:16.651 --> 01:31:19.174
How many were Andromedans?

01:31:19.175 --> 01:31:21.306
You-you... you lied to me.

01:31:21.307 --> 01:31:24.048
How many were Andromedans?!

01:31:26.008 --> 01:31:28.489
- Two.
- Two?

01:31:31.013 --> 01:31:32.709
You miserable fucking idiot.

01:31:32.710 --> 01:31:34.058
Do you know what you've done?

01:31:34.059 --> 01:31:35.495
You...

01:31:35.496 --> 01:31:36.844
you killed her.

01:31:36.845 --> 01:31:38.149
Quiet.

01:31:39.804 --> 01:31:43.938
And I'll tell you why it is
I resemble a human.

01:31:43.939 --> 01:31:46.680
Our 75th emperor
first discovered the Earth.

01:31:48.944 --> 01:31:51.554
This planet was ruled
by dinosaurs,

01:31:51.555 --> 01:31:55.558
magnificent creatures with
a complex but stable ecosystem.

01:31:55.559 --> 01:31:58.082
Oh.

01:31:58.083 --> 01:32:02.044
But we inadvertently spread
a fatal virus to the planet.

01:32:03.393 --> 01:32:05.568
And the emperor was struck
with guilt,

01:32:05.569 --> 01:32:07.658
watching all of Earth's
creatures perish.

01:32:08.790 --> 01:32:10.791
So he gave new life
to this planet.

01:32:10.792 --> 01:32:14.142
Life resembling us.

01:32:14.143 --> 01:32:16.187
The early test humans
could barely stand,

01:32:16.188 --> 01:32:19.714
but soon they walked
and began to reproduce.

01:32:21.237 --> 01:32:24.282
A civilization was born
in harmony with nature.

01:32:24.283 --> 01:32:26.981
Atlantis.

01:32:26.982 --> 01:32:29.549
We were worshipped as gods.

01:32:29.550 --> 01:32:33.204
But some humans wished
to surpass us,

01:32:33.205 --> 01:32:35.946
so they began creating
their own new,

01:32:35.947 --> 01:32:40.124
lab-grown humans
that were stronger.

01:32:40.125 --> 01:32:41.909
But the new humans were
also more aggressive,

01:32:41.910 --> 01:32:44.215
so a conflict broke out

01:32:44.216 --> 01:32:46.783
that eventually resulted in
a thermonuclear war.

01:32:46.784 --> 01:32:49.830
And in the war's wake, all
of humanity was extinguished,

01:32:49.831 --> 01:32:52.920
save for a select few,
who built an ark

01:32:52.921 --> 01:32:55.226
and traveled the oceans
for a century.

01:32:55.227 --> 01:32:57.838
When it was finally safe
to resurface on dry land,

01:32:57.839 --> 01:32:59.927
the leaders of the ark died,

01:32:59.928 --> 01:33:03.104
leaving behind
only a few mutant specimens

01:33:03.105 --> 01:33:06.368
of degraded semi-humans.

01:33:06.369 --> 01:33:08.110
The apes.

01:33:09.198 --> 01:33:11.373
Evolution resumed
but toward chaos.

01:33:11.374 --> 01:33:14.637
The newly evolved human beings,
your current ancestors,

01:33:14.638 --> 01:33:18.510
fought amongst themselves
in an endless cycle of war,

01:33:18.511 --> 01:33:21.470
genocide,
ecological destruction.

01:33:21.471 --> 01:33:23.515
They brutalized Earth.

01:33:23.516 --> 01:33:25.909
They ruined her waters,
ravaged her climate,

01:33:25.910 --> 01:33:28.782
poisoned themselves
with drugs and technology.

01:33:28.783 --> 01:33:31.349
And even when presented
with irrefutable evidence

01:33:31.350 --> 01:33:37.007
of their own self-destruction,
the humans continued unabated.

01:33:37.008 --> 01:33:40.532
Even I myself became more human,

01:33:40.533 --> 01:33:42.230
more selfish and cruel,

01:33:42.231 --> 01:33:45.538
the longer I stayed here
amongst your kind.

01:33:46.714 --> 01:33:49.150
But humans can't help
the way they are.

01:33:49.151 --> 01:33:51.283
It's in your genes.

01:33:52.415 --> 01:33:54.721
The genes implanted
by your ancestors

01:33:54.722 --> 01:33:56.505
to strengthen themselves.

01:33:56.506 --> 01:34:00.161
It gets reproduced in your
bodies, and it grows stronger.

01:34:00.162 --> 01:34:04.600
We Andromedans are here to
eliminate that suicidal gene.

01:34:04.601 --> 01:34:07.168
To save humanity.

01:34:07.169 --> 01:34:11.041
But also to save Earth
from you and your kind.

01:34:11.042 --> 01:34:12.826
No.

01:34:14.567 --> 01:34:17.221
No, you came here to kill us.

01:34:17.222 --> 01:34:18.658
Y-You came to kill us.

01:34:18.659 --> 01:34:20.529
Well, that's wrong.
That's wrong, Teddy.

01:34:20.530 --> 01:34:22.096
Some of us would have preferred

01:34:22.097 --> 01:34:24.141
to simply eliminate
your species,

01:34:24.142 --> 01:34:25.839
but the emperor believed
there was still hope,

01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:29.190
so the experiments.

01:34:29.191 --> 01:34:30.931
The experiments
your mother was a part of.

01:34:30.932 --> 01:34:33.020
She was chosen
because she was weak.

01:34:33.021 --> 01:34:34.674
Because she was broken.

01:34:34.675 --> 01:34:36.763
If we could correct her,

01:34:36.764 --> 01:34:39.679
perhaps all humans
could be corrected.

01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:42.159
But you... you killed her!

01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:44.118
You killed her.

01:34:44.119 --> 01:34:45.685
I figured you'd be apprehended

01:34:45.686 --> 01:34:47.382
feeding antifreeze
to a coma patient

01:34:47.383 --> 01:34:50.167
and then I'd be freed
and could return to my work.

01:34:50.168 --> 01:34:54.128
But you actually got away
with it, you sick ape.

01:34:54.129 --> 01:34:55.564
I'm not a sick ape.

01:34:55.565 --> 01:34:57.393
You are a sick ape.

01:34:58.611 --> 01:35:00.264
Listen, there are other
test subjects

01:35:00.265 --> 01:35:01.831
who are showing progress,

01:35:01.832 --> 01:35:03.615
and we must show the emperor
the truth.

01:35:03.616 --> 01:35:05.748
Tomorrow.

01:35:05.749 --> 01:35:07.402
During the lunar eclipse.

01:35:07.403 --> 01:35:10.100
Why?

01:35:10.101 --> 01:35:11.928
Teddy, listen, I know, I know.

01:35:11.929 --> 01:35:13.843
You may hate me,

01:35:13.844 --> 01:35:16.890
you may want me dead--
I don't blame you--

01:35:16.891 --> 01:35:19.675
but I have the information
you need to save Earth,

01:35:19.676 --> 01:35:21.329
and you know I do.

01:35:21.330 --> 01:35:23.287
You're a fucking demon.

01:35:23.288 --> 01:35:26.334
This is our destiny, Teddy Gatz.

01:35:26.335 --> 01:35:28.336
Yours and mine.

01:35:28.337 --> 01:35:30.861
And the hour is almost upon us.

01:35:32.428 --> 01:35:34.211
Yay.

01:35:45.658 --> 01:35:47.355
Jesus, Ms. Fuller?

01:35:47.356 --> 01:35:48.617
Hi, Ricky.

01:35:48.618 --> 01:35:50.184
How are you? I'm back.

01:35:50.185 --> 01:35:51.707
Could you buzz me in, please?

01:35:51.708 --> 01:35:53.361
Are you okay?
Are you-you all right?

01:35:53.362 --> 01:35:54.623
Oh, I'm all right.

01:35:54.624 --> 01:35:56.233
Everything's been sorted out.

01:35:56.234 --> 01:35:57.758
Could you just...
could you buzz me in, please?

01:35:58.759 --> 01:36:00.630
Thank you, Ricky.

01:36:25.437 --> 01:36:28.049
Park in your usual spot.

01:36:30.965 --> 01:36:32.749
Don't worry, Don.

01:36:34.098 --> 01:36:36.797
You're coming with me.
I'm taking you with me.

01:36:51.202 --> 01:36:52.594
Hi, Tony.

01:36:52.595 --> 01:36:54.858
There you go.
Have a good evening.

01:37:07.349 --> 01:37:08.828
Hello.

01:37:14.530 --> 01:37:16.314
Doors opening.

01:37:21.232 --> 01:37:23.104
Doors closing.

01:37:28.892 --> 01:37:30.371
Hi.

01:37:30.372 --> 01:37:32.199
Good to see you.

01:37:32.200 --> 01:37:33.636
It's good to be back.

01:37:34.637 --> 01:37:36.204
Hmm.

01:37:37.466 --> 01:37:39.380
Oh, it's-it's 5:35,

01:37:39.381 --> 01:37:41.861
so if any of you need
to go home, just...

01:37:41.862 --> 01:37:43.819
you know, feel free.

01:37:43.820 --> 01:37:45.647
- Hi, Corey.
- Michelle?

01:37:45.648 --> 01:37:49.085
Uh, we have some business
to do, so, um, no disturbances.

01:37:49.086 --> 01:37:50.608
- Okay?
-Okay?

01:37:50.609 --> 01:37:52.350
All right. Thank you.

01:38:00.010 --> 01:38:03.795
Okay, so, uh, he-he meets us
here then? Or...

01:38:03.796 --> 01:38:06.929
Uh, we make remote contact
with the emperor here,

01:38:06.930 --> 01:38:09.410
and then they beam us up.

01:38:09.411 --> 01:38:11.891
Beam us up?

01:38:11.892 --> 01:38:13.981
Or, you know, transport.

01:38:15.156 --> 01:38:16.635
Okay.

01:38:18.942 --> 01:38:21.291
Uh, it sometimes
takes a couple of minutes

01:38:21.292 --> 01:38:24.252
to get the link working, so...

01:38:26.558 --> 01:38:28.081
Okay.

01:38:28.082 --> 01:38:33.564
Uh, and, uh, how exactly
do we make the link?

01:38:33.565 --> 01:38:36.350
Uh, this will sound crazy,
but, um,

01:38:36.351 --> 01:38:39.614
I-I punch in a code here,

01:38:39.615 --> 01:38:44.925
and then, um, it initiates
a link with the ship.

01:38:46.578 --> 01:38:49.319
- On a calculator?
-  Yeah, I know.

01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:51.539
I know. It had to look banal.

01:38:51.540 --> 01:38:53.323
And human.

01:38:53.324 --> 01:38:55.717
And, you know,
inconspicuous, so...

01:38:55.718 --> 01:38:58.546
It's a 58-digit code,
and I have it memorized,

01:38:58.547 --> 01:39:01.070
but it's been a while
since I had to...

01:39:01.071 --> 01:39:03.552
since I had to type it out,
so...

01:39:11.864 --> 01:39:13.648
So, is this,
is this really how it works?

01:39:13.649 --> 01:39:15.867
You know, it's better
if we don't talk, actually.

01:39:15.868 --> 01:39:17.521
Just because I... Sorry.

01:39:17.522 --> 01:39:22.787
It's a... It's this memory,
um, thing that I do,

01:39:22.788 --> 01:39:24.485
like a trick for...

01:39:24.486 --> 01:39:26.400
for remembering.

01:39:26.401 --> 01:39:27.837
Um...

01:39:33.147 --> 01:39:34.496
Um...

01:39:39.675 --> 01:39:41.371
Can they see through here?

01:39:41.372 --> 01:39:42.546
- Oh, no.
- Can they...

01:39:42.547 --> 01:39:44.201
- Can they see in here?
- No.

01:39:45.159 --> 01:39:47.073
Um...

01:39:53.689 --> 01:39:55.516
- Why is it so long?
- It's...

01:39:55.517 --> 01:39:57.257
I have a few, um...

01:39:57.258 --> 01:39:59.215
Just shh-shh for a,
for a second while I think.

01:39:59.216 --> 01:40:01.479
- Oh. Sorry.
- Um...

01:40:08.399 --> 01:40:11.358
Yeah. Okay.

01:40:11.359 --> 01:40:13.360
That's...

01:40:13.361 --> 01:40:15.884
That's it. Um...

01:40:15.885 --> 01:40:17.799
I mean, I just have
to press "enter," mainly.

01:40:17.800 --> 01:40:19.628
So, are you ready?

01:40:20.629 --> 01:40:22.195
Yes, I'm ready.

01:40:22.196 --> 01:40:24.066
Fuck, wait.

01:40:24.067 --> 01:40:26.199
My air tank.

01:40:26.200 --> 01:40:28.157
I'll need oxygen,
and I don't have my air tank.

01:40:28.158 --> 01:40:30.116
Oh, there'll be oxygen, Teddy.

01:40:30.117 --> 01:40:31.813
Okay.

01:40:31.814 --> 01:40:34.381
What about Don?

01:40:34.382 --> 01:40:36.687
Oh, we'll send for Don.

01:40:36.688 --> 01:40:39.604
We may even be able
to revive him.

01:40:41.650 --> 01:40:43.564
Right. So, it's happening. Shit.

01:40:43.565 --> 01:40:44.956
Um...

01:40:44.957 --> 01:40:46.523
No, I'm ready. I'm ready.

01:40:46.524 --> 01:40:48.482
Um...

01:40:48.483 --> 01:40:53.139
you should know that I've
prepared for all eventualities.

01:40:53.140 --> 01:40:55.619
Okay. Prepared how?

01:40:55.620 --> 01:40:56.751
Oh.

01:40:56.752 --> 01:40:59.014
Oh, shit, Teddy.

01:40:59.015 --> 01:41:02.148
I can't take the chance of you
just killing me straightaway.

01:41:02.149 --> 01:41:03.627
No.
That was smart.

01:41:03.628 --> 01:41:05.281
That was very smart,

01:41:05.282 --> 01:41:08.372
and the emperor will admire
your intelligence.

01:41:10.505 --> 01:41:13.463
You're a credit
to your species, Teddy. Truly.

01:41:13.464 --> 01:41:15.988
Well, I'm just trying to help.

01:41:17.903 --> 01:41:20.166
I know, Teddy.

01:41:20.167 --> 01:41:24.866
Um, so this... this closet here
is a teleporter.

01:41:24.867 --> 01:41:26.694
So you'll...
you'll enter the closet,

01:41:26.695 --> 01:41:28.435
and then you'll close
the door behind you.

01:41:28.436 --> 01:41:32.439
And then I'll-I'll count
to three and press "enter."

01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:34.136
And we'll have to go
one after the other

01:41:34.137 --> 01:41:36.356
so that our bodies don't
reconstitute together

01:41:36.357 --> 01:41:38.488
during teleportation.
You understand?

01:41:38.489 --> 01:41:39.968
Uh-huh.

01:41:39.969 --> 01:41:41.623
Yeah, I think so.

01:41:43.538 --> 01:41:46.105
So I just go in the closet?

01:41:46.106 --> 01:41:48.716
- I can go first. I...
- No, no, no, no.

01:41:48.717 --> 01:41:50.457
I'll go first.
I don't want you to escape

01:41:50.458 --> 01:41:51.893
and just leave me here.

01:41:51.894 --> 01:41:54.026
Okay.

01:42:09.259 --> 01:42:10.347
Ready?

01:42:12.828 --> 01:42:14.525
I'm ready.

01:42:15.787 --> 01:42:17.702
I'll see you up there.

01:42:24.448 --> 01:42:26.320
Three.

01:42:28.017 --> 01:42:29.671
Two.

01:42:31.368 --> 01:42:32.890
One.

01:43:15.107 --> 01:43:16.934
You're gonna be fine.

01:43:16.935 --> 01:43:18.675
Yeah, I-I know.

01:43:18.676 --> 01:43:22.810
I mean, obviously
the shock of it all is...

01:43:22.811 --> 01:43:25.204
But you can get plenty of help
for that kind of thing.

01:43:25.205 --> 01:43:26.944
So he's dead then?

01:43:26.945 --> 01:43:29.120
- Yeah, he passed away.
- Okay.

01:43:29.121 --> 01:43:32.907
The bomb must have reacted
to his body heat or friction.

01:43:32.908 --> 01:43:34.604
It happens a lot
with homemade explosives.

01:43:34.605 --> 01:43:36.127
Right.

01:43:36.128 --> 01:43:37.694
Ma'am, please don't
take that off. -Look.

01:43:37.695 --> 01:43:39.305
Ma'am, I'm gonna need you
to lie back down.

01:43:39.306 --> 01:43:40.697
- I'm fine.
- You need to stay here.

01:43:40.698 --> 01:43:42.395
- Can you just stay still?
- I'm good.

01:43:42.396 --> 01:43:43.787
- I'm good. I'm good.
- Ma'am. Please. Hold on. Stop!

01:43:43.788 --> 01:43:45.963
Wait! Hold on!

01:43:45.964 --> 01:43:47.226
Stop.

01:44:49.767 --> 01:44:51.333
Hey, um, you're not...

01:44:51.334 --> 01:44:53.335
Sorry, you're not, uh...

01:44:53.336 --> 01:44:55.032
Oh, I just-- I forgot something.

01:44:55.033 --> 01:44:56.860
Just really quickly. One second.

01:44:56.861 --> 01:44:58.209
- You're not allowed in there.
- Just-just one sec, one sec.

01:44:58.210 --> 01:45:00.430
Don't touch that! Hey! Hey!

01:45:02.432 --> 01:45:04.304
Oh, my God. Jesus.

01:46:09.281 --> 01:46:11.239
Emperor.

01:46:11.240 --> 01:46:14.373
We believed contact would
be made if help was required.

01:46:14.374 --> 01:46:18.159
We could not contact you
without hair.

01:46:18.160 --> 01:46:20.380
Yes, we know.

01:46:20.945 --> 01:46:22.772
We feel remorse.

01:46:22.773 --> 01:46:24.340
There was nothing we could do.

01:46:25.080 --> 01:46:27.081
We all feel remorse.

01:46:27.082 --> 01:46:29.084
That's over now.

01:46:29.998 --> 01:46:31.913
Inform us of the experiments

01:46:33.131 --> 01:46:35.655
on the human subjects.

01:46:35.656 --> 01:46:38.222
The experiments
have nearly all failed.

01:46:38.223 --> 01:46:42.009
There are only two
human subjects remaining

01:46:42.010 --> 01:46:44.099
and the likelihood of success

01:46:44.534 --> 01:46:46.666
is zero.

01:46:46.667 --> 01:46:49.059
Because of who they are.

01:46:49.060 --> 01:46:52.977
A decision needs to be made.

01:47:03.814 --> 01:47:06.250
We believe

01:47:06.251 --> 01:47:08.601
that it is over.

01:47:08.602 --> 01:47:11.212
They have had their time.

01:47:11.213 --> 01:47:14.258
And in their time
they have imperiled

01:47:14.259 --> 01:47:16.653
the life they share.

01:47:17.524 --> 01:47:19.525
And so we have decided

01:47:19.526 --> 01:47:22.093
their time will end.
