Viewer discretion is advised.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.760
If I’d known staying here
would inconvenience them this much,

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.460
I would’ve stayed at the hotel I booked.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.300
I just want to take care of you
as best as I can.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:22.370
That’s all.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.490
You have to follow my orders today.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:26.400
Give me a smile.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.210
When you look at someone you love,
what kind of eyes do you usually give them?

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.790
The eyes I give someone I love?

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:32.299
What’s the meaning of this?

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:33.540
Why is Peach not the photographer?

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:34.730
Did no one tell you?

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.350
Before Wiwid fired me,
he had already signed a new photographer.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.400
You’re the one
who screwed up my life, aren’t you?

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.600
Mr. Thee!

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:44.900
I’m not going to kill him.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.410
Don’t hurt our kids!

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:49.390
Let go of me!

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.629
I’m here. It’s okay.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.400
Does it hurt, Peach?

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:14.650
Don’t be afraid.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.450
I’ll protect you, Lookplub.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.250
But what about you?

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.200
No one can protect you.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.350
I’ve been worried sick about you.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:47.700
Did you stay with me all night?

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.300
Do you realize how long you were asleep?

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.850
If you’d opened your eyes
just one hour later,

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.400
I would've gone into your dream
to pull you out.

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:10.600
Why are you smiling?

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.530
Did I hurt you?

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.900
Wait here. I’ll get you a doctor.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.000
Hey.

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.610
No.

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.150
It doesn’t hurt.

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.940
-You don’t have to.
-But you’re crying.

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:42.000
No.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.950
I can see it with my own eyes.
Why are you denying it?

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.420
You’re with me.
What are you still afraid of?

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.900
You’re the reason.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.270
Is someone like me, who’s willing to
protect you with my life, making you cry?

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.000
Make the most of your days off.

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.250
I can handle things here. Don’t worry.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.520
(But Boss…)

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:39.420
Talk to you later, Mok.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.050
I have to take care of Peach now.

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:42.010
(Yes, Boss.)

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:51.500
How is he?

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.170
The doctor said
there’s nothing to worry about.

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:57.000
Are you sure?

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.200
There’s no internal injury?

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:01.700
What about his brain,

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:03.700
internal organs,

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:05.970
or anything that could become
a chronic problem in the future?

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.900
Is there anything like that?

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.700
I think you should listen to the nurse.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.010
Earlier, the doctor did a full check.

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:14.200
What about his hands?

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.700
Can he still hold a camera like usual?

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.400
There’s nothing to worry about, right?

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.100
All the test results came back good.

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.700
You can leave.

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.330
I need some private time.

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.230
Let’s finish settling this.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:37.550
What is this about?

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.700
If someone had to make you cry,

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.000
can I be the last person on earth
to do that?

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.150
Kian’s right-hand man
is still as good as ever.

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:28.500
Please keep your distance.

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:31.600
How far do you want?

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:36.400
A normal distance between
a boss and an employee.

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:40.730
You’re so cold.

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:46.000
Please don’t do that again, Mr. Kritdanai.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:49.140
You know I don’t like it.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.010
But I like it.

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:50.820
Ouch!

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:01.850
Wow.

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:04.070
Your heart is beating pretty fast.

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.100
How’s it going in the love department?

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:20.650
Single.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:24.500
I’m asking about Kian.

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:29.060
I’m talking about Mr. Thee too.

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:31.050
Amazing.

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:32.300
How’s that amazing?

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:36.780
You two used to wish each other
would find good love.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.200
What I think is amazing…

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:40.900
is you.

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:09.550
Why didn’t you call me?

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.700
At that moment,
it was hard to even run away.

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:19.940
I mean before that.

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:21.650
Why didn’t you call to tell me
you didn’t have a car?

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.750
Can I really call you
about something that small?

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.200
Hundreds and thousands of people
want my number.

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:30.040
You have my number, but won’t call me.

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:33.299
I didn’t know you’d allow me to do that.

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:40.200
I was the one who saved my number
on your phone.

00:08:42.299 --> 00:08:44.100
That means I gave you permission
to call me

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:47.350
about anything at any time.

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:49.500
Or as often as you want.

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:10.150
Don’t bite your lips.

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:11.950
They could crack.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.670
I can’t stand seeing you hurt
any more than you already are, Peach.

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:39.250
You look like you’re going to cry again.

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:42.630
Am I hurting you?

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:44.550
Do you want me to leave?

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:25.900
You’re making me feel like a little kid.

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:33.070
It’d be great if you were little.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.750
I’d carry you in my pocket everywhere.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.500
I won’t let anyone hurt you again.

00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:45.610
Mr. Thee.

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:54.400
You’re mine.

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:58.300
No one has the right to mess with
the one I call mine.

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:26.330
Reasons humans cry.

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:29.860
(Humans cry for many reasons.)

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:32.290
(They can be physical or mental.)

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.980
(Humans cry because of
overwhelming feelings.)

00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:38.500
(Sadness, happiness, pain,
or even stress.)

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.420
(Tears are a form of release.)

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:46.380
I’m sorry I cried to you.

00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:48.670
You’re probably surprised.

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:52.830
I didn’t cry because
you did something bad,

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:55.370
but because you did something good.

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:04.100
If I did something good,
then you should be smiling.

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:09.300
You might know a bit about my background.

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:12.040
Did Mok tell on me?

00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:16.450
You might already know that
my sister and I only have each other.

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:25.240
I had to grow up quickly to become
a father, a mother, and a brother to Plub.

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:30.850
It’s like I’m forced
to never show weakness.

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:36.750
I actually don’t even remember
the last time I cried.

00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:41.450
If I had to cry,
I’d have to do it alone in secret.

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:47.300
With you earlier, I felt like a kid again.

00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:03.100
I just realized how good
being taken care of by someone feels.

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:11.820
(If you want to take care of someone
for the rest of your life,)

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:16.100
(the best way is to get married
and constantly give each other love.)

00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:20.640
(But before you get there,
don’t forget to win their heart first.)

00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:22.400
(I’m rooting for you.)

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:45.620
Yes, I’m sorry.

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:48.500
I didn’t text you back because
I fell asleep.

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:51.350
(I called you so many times,
but you wouldn’t pick up.)

00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:54.190
(I was worried sick.
I almost went to see you at home.)

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:55.300
Huh? Did you come?

00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:57.740
(You sound weird,
like you didn’t come home last night.)

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:01.300
Of course, I came home.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.700
Where else would I have stayed?

00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:05.700
I promise it won’t happen again.

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:08.180
Come on. Let me open it for you.

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:09.300
(Whose voice is that?)

00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:26.000
Whose voice? No one.

00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:40.970
(Send me a selfie.)

00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:41.480
Huh?

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:42.950
(Send me a selfie.)

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:44.780
Oh, okay.

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:46.050
Give me a second.

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:48.660
Let me take one inside the house.

00:14:58.960 --> 00:14:59.450
Hello?

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:02.140
I’ll send it in a bit.

00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:10.470
Sent.

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:14.250
(Whose shadow is that in the mirror?)

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:15.700
Huh? Who?

00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:17.900
Was it the light?

00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:19.900
Don’t say stuff like that, Plub.
You’re scaring me.

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:32.370
Plub! Are you pranking me?

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:35.140
(Don’t let me find out
you’re secretly dating)

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:36.400
(and that’s why you didn’t come home.)

00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:39.130
I’m an adult. Why would I date in secret?

00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:41.230
(If you want to confess,
just tell me when to meet up.)

00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:42.530
(Don’t make me find out on my own.)

00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:44.570
What are you doing, by the way?

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.300
Are you at the office?
What time do you get off?

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:49.600
(I’m at the outpost.)

00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:50.500
Huh?

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:52.000
You’re at the guard post?

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:55.900
Hey, hide!

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:57.150
My sister is almost here!

00:15:57.810 --> 00:15:58.820
Right here. Hide yourself.

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:00.250
-Are you sure this is a good idea?
-Get inside.

00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:01.620
But you have a lot of stuff in here.

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:02.600
Try to get in.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:04.400
I’m trying.

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:07.200
Alright, come out.

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:07.970
Come out.

00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:09.010
Go hide under the table.

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:11.360
Duck down.

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:12.500
Under the table.

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:13.250
Hide your head too.

00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:17.300
Your sister must be blind

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:18.510
if she doesn’t see me.

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:22.910
Come here.

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:25.020
Go over there. Go!

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:31.200
(Help me push the bottom lane.
They’re in our outpost.)

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:32.500
(Freaking pay attention!)

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:40.250
Which post are you at, Plub?

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:42.190
(I gotta go, Peach.
My base is getting destroyed.)

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:44.580
Is it down yet?

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:50.200
Almost.

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:52.370
Hey. Crush! Crush! Crush!

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:53.690
The outpost?

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:55.930
Oh, it’s my head
that’s about to get crushed.

00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:58.870
Let’s get to work.

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:02.700
Protect the outpost!

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:04.660
Don’t let it get destroyed.

00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:10.010
Come on!

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:27.250
Come here.

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:29.000
Hmm?

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:31.550
Lie down properly.

00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:33.660
What are you doing?

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:35.500
Come on.

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:44.300
Close your eyes.

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:45.250
Hmm?

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:46.900
I said, close your eyes.

00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:55.850
Let’s apply this.

00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:58.550
You’ve been crying a lot.
Your eyes could get really swollen.

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:00.550
If we don’t do this, it’ll get worse.

00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:02.200
Oh, wow.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:03.900
You’re so good at this.

00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:05.650
You must do it
for other people all the time.

00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:09.730
I got it from soap operas.

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:13.570
You really are obsessed
with soap operas, aren’t you?

00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:18.850
So, is it true that you don’t have anyone?

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:20.150
Hmm?

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:23.230
Your sister asked if you had a partner.

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:24.410
Please.

00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:26.820
Where would I find the time to get one?

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:33.600
But recently,

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:37.400
someone’s made your heart
flutter and waver.

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:39.250
Am I right?

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:42.700
Hmm? No.

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:50.500
Not even a little?

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:53.900
Where would I find the time
to catch feelings for anyone?

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:55.180
I’m only spending time
with you these days.

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:05.900
Mr. Thee.

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:07.750
Ouch!

00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:08.600
Hey.

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:09.810
Hey!

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:10.560
Hey!

00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:12.040
Get a grip, Mr. Thee!

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:16.600
Half of my face almost went numb.

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:31.100
Can I try that instrument?

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:25.370
I’ve never seen you this interested
in anything.

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:26.500
Are you sure?

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:38.250
I want to try playing it.

00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:55.250
You’d better take off your ring.

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:16.040
Take it easy.

00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:18.550
These things take time.

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:19.740
But I want to be able to do it.

00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:21.650
Why do you suddenly want to play it?

00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:23.060
Are you interested in music?

00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:24.050
I’m interested in you.

00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:28.370
I want to get to know what you like.

00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:38.000
Why did you ask me
to come take photos here with you?

00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:42.370
You want to learn about what I like,
don’t you?

00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:44.550
A handpan might be a bit too difficult.

00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:46.900
Let’s start with photography.

00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:50.940
Besides, I love taking photos
more than playing the instrument.

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:52.850
Just a little.

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:56.650
Give me a smile.

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:00.750
I only know how to make this face.

00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:04.700
Happy or sad, it’s the same face.

00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:08.800
You want to smile so badly,
but you have to act cool.

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:10.030
That’s why you’re stuck with that face.

00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:21.600
See? You can make more than one face.

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:23.500
How many millions
could this photo sell for?

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:25.300
The ARSENI president with his sweet smile.

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:29.100
Sweet smile?

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:30.700
You have a beautiful smile.

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:32.800
You should smile often.

00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:35.850
Smile at you.

00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:00.750
Teach me how to take photos.

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:12.040
Let’s try something easy first.

00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:13.290
Let it do that automatically.

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:14.210
Okay.

00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:18.400
Put something interesting here.

00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:21.600
See? The sharpness changes.

00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:25.480
Try taking one here.

00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:28.460
Not bad.

00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:29.780
Well done.

00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:31.290
Try this.

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:42.300
What’s wrong?

00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:48.900
That photo looks great.

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:50.330
It’s tilted, and you can see it.

00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:52.800
You don’t have to comfort me.

00:23:54.450 --> 00:24:00.000
If it’s tilted,
next time just check this line.

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:02.350
It’s the cut of the nine-box grid.

00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:05.030
Cut what?

00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:06.630
Why?

00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:09.380
It's the Rule of Thirds.

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:13.570
It’s used to check
the symmetry of a photo.

00:24:14.370 --> 00:24:16.000
This one is a bit blown out.

00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:17.300
How should I adjust it?

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:19.700
Press here and look here.

00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:21.700
This is called a histogram.

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:27.560
It’s all like an alien language.

00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:31.200
Did you have to study all that?

00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:33.500
You’re really good at this.

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:37.900
We all have things we’re good at
and things we’re not.

00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:41.200
Managing a business like you do?

00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:43.000
That’s something I can’t do.

00:24:46.330 --> 00:24:49.900
My job is just pressing the shutter.

00:24:50.170 --> 00:24:51.600
I can take ten or a hundred shots,
just in case.

00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:54.370
But your work?

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:57.050
Just one wrong decision,

00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:59.700
and you’re responsible for
the whole of ARSENI.

00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:03.240
Not to mention your employees’ families.

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:14.470
You’re doing amazing.

00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:20.150
Am I doing okay?

00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:25.060
Hey.

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:26.700
No one’s ever told me I’m amazing.

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:30.500
Once I manage to do something,
I have to do better.

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:34.100
No matter how much I do,
it’s never enough.

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:44.000
What you’re doing is more than
any one person can handle.

00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:50.700
Take a break and be lazy sometimes.

00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:58.200
Add some silly things to your life.

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:10.950
Hey.

00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:13.150
Hey.

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:15.820
Do you get what I’m saying?

00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:28.700
Come on.

00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:30.200
Let’s take some photos together.

00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:36.300
For what occasion?

00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:39.650
Why would we need one?

00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:45.770
It’s just to add something silly
to your life.

00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:48.250
Come on. Get in the frame.

00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:51.700
Two amazing people.

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:53.660
Cheese.

00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:09.280
Hey.

00:27:10.690 --> 00:27:12.500
You still haven’t called your men
to pick you up?

00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:15.700
And what are all these things
hanging in front of my house?

00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:17.950
I don’t want to leave you alone just yet.

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:20.450
But it’s late.

00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:22.580
You haven’t slept since yesterday.

00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:25.580
I’m fine now. I can be on my own.

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:29.180
Can you stop being used to being
on your own

00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:31.450
and just let me into your world?

00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:41.700
I’m going out of my way
to offer myself to you.

00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:43.650
If you reject me,

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:45.800
you might regret it
for the rest of your life.

00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:51.300
What soap opera did he get that from now?

00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:54.700
(I’ve sent the team to pick you up, Boss.)

00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:56.140
What about the other thing
I asked you to take care of?

00:27:56.530 --> 00:27:57.400
Is it done?

00:27:58.130 --> 00:27:58.850
(Yes.)

00:27:59.370 --> 00:27:59.900
Good.

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:02.500
If we’re going to strike a snake,
we have to finish it off.

00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:17.550
Is that about Wiwid?

00:28:23.470 --> 00:28:25.400
I didn’t think he’d go so far.

00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:27.630
I’ve had my people watching him

00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:31.300
since the day you asked me to let him go.

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:34.200
And look what happened.

00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:38.400
He eventually showed the stupidity
he mistook for cleverness.

00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:42.850
I won’t even let an ant bite
the tip of my finger.

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:46.140
How dare he mess with my man?

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:52.200
I think what I’m about to ask
will upset you.

00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:57.600
No matter how displeased
your question makes me,

00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:00.200
I’d never hurt you.

00:29:03.410 --> 00:29:05.100
You’re my exception in everything.

00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:07.340
How’s Wiwid?

00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:11.500
Don’t tell me he’s dead.

00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:15.740
Why would I do that and make you mad?

00:29:17.910 --> 00:29:19.250
Then how is he?

00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:25.150
You’re really upsetting me
with your question.

00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:28.970
Hey.

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:29.600
No.

00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:31.850
Don’t shoot.

00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:35.300
I’m not going to kill him,

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:37.800
but he needs to hurt more than you do.

00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:39.700
Many times more.

00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:43.700
I’m sorry, Mr. Thee!

00:29:43.770 --> 00:29:44.600
I won’t do this again!

00:29:48.270 --> 00:29:48.750
Hey.

00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:54.900
You’re the reason he’s still alive.

00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:56.330
Ouch!

00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:02.200
You were the one who saved him
from being slaughtered.

00:30:03.150 --> 00:30:03.900
Did you forget?

00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:05.530
I only asked for his life to be spared.

00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:07.400
You sound like
you’re talking about an animal.

00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:13.620
You should stop talking about him
and try to make up with me already.

00:30:13.890 --> 00:30:15.400
If he’s not dead, then how is he?

00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:23.200
He’s still alive somewhere in this world.

00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:25.050
What do you mean?

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:26.900
Shouldn’t it be enough for you
that he’s alive?

00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:32.200
Do you have any idea
how shattered I felt when I saw you hurt?

00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:46.230
Honestly, when I saw that you were
the one saving me in that moment,

00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:48.500
I kinda felt good.

00:30:52.010 --> 00:30:54.450
I knew I was safe with you.

00:30:56.820 --> 00:30:58.200
People are usually afraid of me.

00:31:00.290 --> 00:31:01.880
Once again, you’re the first
to think otherwise.

00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:03.830
Thank you.

00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:06.980
Without you, things would’ve been
worse for me.

00:31:07.010 --> 00:31:07.850
But you have me.

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:18.000
Your men probably arrived.

00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:21.180
Let’s hurry up and eat. It’s late.

00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:22.150
You have to leave soon.

00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:25.250
No.

00:31:27.530 --> 00:31:28.580
Well…

00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:37.970
Can I walk you up and see you to bed?

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:39.250
Huh?

00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:09.200
What’s the meaning of this?

00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:13.400
What are you talking about?

00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:14.350
This!

00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:29.250
You’ve crushed my heart into pieces.

00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:32.530
You’ve done it, Peachayarat.

00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:35.600
I’m hurting to the point of dying.

00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:42.250
Huh?

00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:48.000
I keep repeating it to you
from morning to night

00:32:48.490 --> 00:32:50.700
that you will be safe under my care!

00:32:51.210 --> 00:32:52.670
And you still think of
running away from me?

00:32:53.130 --> 00:32:54.150
Hear me out.

00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:55.460
Remember this!

00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:58.400
Not even death can take you away from me!

00:32:58.970 --> 00:33:01.700
If Hell or Heaven has anyone
from the Lee family there,

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:05.980
I’ll have my ancestors lock you away
until the day I die and fall after you!

00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:08.450
Die and fall?

00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:10.040
You’re not planning on going to Heaven?

00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:10.790
Keep it coming!

00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:13.200
Come up with more cruel words.

00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:14.900
Keep stabbing my heart with them!

00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:15.800
Go on!

00:33:16.390 --> 00:33:17.540
Get a grip.

00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:20.400
I phrase every word carefully
before I speak.

00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:21.420
I do not act on impulse!

00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:25.000
And I’m reasonable enough not to run away!

00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:28.600
I’m just going on vacation.

00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:36.740
What did you say?

00:33:36.770 --> 00:33:39.570
If you’d kept it together
and read it carefully,

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:42.140
you would’ve seen that
it’s a domestic ticket

00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:44.350
with a return flight.

00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:51.060
A return flight?

00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:02.100
In that case,
can I buy you a private plane

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.050
to make it up to you?

00:34:08.199 --> 00:34:09.400
You won’t have to sit cramped
next to anyone.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.300
Or a private jet.

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:20.590
I can just hire one,
so it’ll be a bit cheaper.

00:34:25.610 --> 00:34:28.060
Or a private beach with a land deed!

00:34:28.830 --> 00:34:29.900
How about a private island?

00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:31.800
Oh, Peach!

00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:33.699
I can’t think of anything
simpler than these!

00:34:39.989 --> 00:34:40.600
Are you sick?

00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:41.750
No.

00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:43.550
Maybe someone’s missing you.

00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:46.300
It’s probably just dust.

00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:12.670
You’re probably right

00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:16.700
because I haven’t started missing you yet.

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:49.600
I have three months off from ARSENI,

00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:51.500
so I just thought I’d go on vacation.

00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:53.650
I’m not going to Hell.

00:35:57.240 --> 00:35:58.200
I’ve asked you this before,

00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:00.350
but I’ll ask again.

00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:05.750
If you want to keep working
on the project,

00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:07.600
you know I can make it happen, right?

00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:08.400
Of course.

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:11.860
Is there anything
Theerakit Kian Lee can’t do?

00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:14.670
I’ll say it again.

00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:17.510
Thank you, but I’m fine.

00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:20.270
I don’t want to cause trouble for anyone.

00:36:21.490 --> 00:36:23.200
But it’s been your project from the start.

00:36:23.530 --> 00:36:25.450
It’s everyone’s project.

00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:29.300
Even without me, it can go on as usual.

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:33.200
I believe everyone will work hard
as usual—

00:36:34.050 --> 00:36:36.900
Nuch, Plub, Note,

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:38.000
and Aran.

00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:40.300
Especially him. You don’t have to worry.

00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:42.350
-He’s professional.
-I’m not worried about Aran or anyone else.

00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:49.230
I’m only worried about you.

00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:53.900
I’m about to go on vacation happily.

00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:55.770
Why do you need to worry about me?

00:37:00.010 --> 00:37:01.250
The day after tomorrow, I have a meeting

00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:03.860
and dinner with my younger brother.

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:04.960
And?

00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:06.160
I can’t go with you.

00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:10.060
When did I invite you?

00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:15.700
Your words are hurting my feelings again.

00:37:17.690 --> 00:37:18.670
I’m sorry.

00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:24.600
I actually don’t want to trouble you.

00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:28.950
I travel alone all the time.

00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:31.700
I stop to take photos along the way

00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:35.340
and sell them online for pocket money.

00:37:37.950 --> 00:37:39.200
You’re squandering your days away.

00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:43.950
Can you be nicer with your words?

00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:47.000
If Thai is so difficult for you,

00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:50.300
you don’t have to use difficult words.

00:37:54.970 --> 00:37:56.150
I have a hotel in that area.

00:37:57.540 --> 00:37:59.200
It has the best views in the city.

00:37:59.250 --> 00:38:00.140
I don’t want to—

00:38:00.190 --> 00:38:01.650
If I can’t go to take care of you
in person,

00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:08.400
can you at least be under my watch?

00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:16.830
Alright.

00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:23.800
I won’t let you be in danger again.

00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:26.150
Even to the farthest edge of the sky,

00:38:27.530 --> 00:38:28.930
I will chase you down and save you.

00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:32.380
Rest assured, Peach.

00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:35.800
Your words are…

00:38:38.170 --> 00:38:39.020
so cheesy.

00:38:40.730 --> 00:38:41.900
But I’m starting to get used to them.

00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:47.150
Is my Thai really that bad?

00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:49.000
Honestly?

00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:49.950
Yes.

00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:53.760
This time, it’s weird too.

00:39:01.290 --> 00:39:02.600
I thought you said you were
getting used to them.

00:39:04.290 --> 00:39:05.140
Why is it still weird?

00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:10.860
This time, it’s not your words
that are weird.

00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:15.030
It’s more about the feelings.

00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:21.600
Hearing your cheesy words makes me…

00:39:23.050 --> 00:39:24.900
feel safe somehow.

00:39:30.570 --> 00:39:31.300
Thank you.

00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:49.000
You’re welcome.

00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:53.470
Mm.

00:40:08.590 --> 00:40:09.100
Kian!

00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:11.180
Kian!

00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:18.360
When did you get back?

00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:19.350
What a weird question.

00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:21.300
Weren’t you the one who chose my flight?

00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:24.550
And the one you sent to pick me up?

00:40:25.310 --> 00:40:26.600
You really know me.

00:40:34.090 --> 00:40:38.100
Or was it not you?

00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:40.900
If I had to do everything myself,

00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:43.210
what would I need an assistant for?

00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:48.600
Ah, no wonder everything was
exactly how I like it.

00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:52.500
Even the food on the plane
was all my favorites.

00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:55.010
Let go of me. I’m going to take a bath.

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:55.950
Kian!

00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:57.990
Come have some fruit first.

00:40:58.180 --> 00:40:59.710
I peeled it myself.

00:41:00.770 --> 00:41:01.550
Pretty please.

00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:14.050
(Auntie Oon, I made the flower garland
tighter than usual today,)

00:41:14.170 --> 00:41:15.600
(so you won’t scold me.)

00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:17.700
(Well done, Miss Kaew.)

00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:20.020
(You’re amazing.)

00:41:20.130 --> 00:41:23.160
This is the first and only drama
where I played the female lead.

00:41:23.870 --> 00:41:25.350
(I learned from the best.)

00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:29.400
I can’t believe you still ask them
to rerun this.

00:41:29.490 --> 00:41:31.030
(So tight.)

00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:35.100
This one is the closest to your real life.

00:41:39.970 --> 00:41:44.600
When I watch it,
it feels like I’m close to you.

00:41:48.990 --> 00:41:50.870
We’re together now.

00:41:52.580 --> 00:41:53.650
Are you happy?

00:41:54.130 --> 00:41:55.400
If you miss her, just fly to see her.

00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:56.700
Hong Kong is only a short flight away.

00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:01.140
You can bring your partner too.

00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:05.890
You talk like
things have changed over there.

00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:08.450
You haven’t been back for so long.

00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:10.100
A lot has changed.

00:42:10.690 --> 00:42:11.950
If things really had changed,

00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:15.850
you wouldn’t have had to fly here
to celebrate your birthday in secret.

00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:22.950
Don’t lie to yourself.

00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:25.000
Nothing can change.

00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:30.380
ARSENI’s enemies
will never cease to exist.

00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:42.550
Please excuse me, Mom.

00:42:50.170 --> 00:42:53.840
Why were you and Dad able to get married,

00:42:55.410 --> 00:42:56.600
but Kian and I

00:42:58.570 --> 00:43:00.000
are forbidden to love?

00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:13.800
Don’t you think that’s unfair to us?

00:43:19.090 --> 00:43:22.400
It’s a rule that you both must accept.

00:43:28.330 --> 00:43:33.850
You have no idea how much Kian and I
have always tried to break this rule.

00:43:35.730 --> 00:43:37.200
You cheeky thing!

00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:40.700
Time to sleep and stop
letting your mind wander.

00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:43.730
Sweet dreams, son.

00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:44.550
Yeah.

00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:46.900
Good night.

00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:47.650
Good night, Mom.

00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:56.000
Take care of him, Mok.

00:43:57.740 --> 00:43:58.270
I will.

00:44:06.350 --> 00:44:07.450
Let me turn off the light for you.

00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:09.800
No need.

00:44:11.930 --> 00:44:13.700
Will you stay here until I fall asleep?

00:44:41.090 --> 00:44:42.450
(You haven’t replied to my messages.)

00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:43.670
Sorry.

00:44:44.210 --> 00:44:46.600
I’m on vacation, so I turned
my notifications off.

00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:48.700
(Alright. When will you come back?)

00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:50.060
(It’s been three days already.)

00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:50.930
Are you crazy?

00:44:51.150 --> 00:44:52.150
What do you mean, three days?

00:44:53.950 --> 00:44:55.400
Not even three hours have passed.

00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:13.290
LET’S EXCHANGE SELFIES.
I WANT TO SEE YOUR FACE NOW.

00:45:19.770 --> 00:45:21.550
Sorry. I couldn’t stop him in time.

00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:23.300
I saw that.

00:45:23.570 --> 00:45:24.500
You were smiling just now.

00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:27.850
What’s your business?

00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:30.780
Tomorrow, Mom’s not free anymore.

00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:31.900
The plan is off.

00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:35.050
What? Your birthday dinner is off?

00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:37.900
But she’s the host.

00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:39.980
Why are you so slow with things like this?

00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:45.010
Why beat around the bush?

00:45:45.830 --> 00:45:46.900
Just say what you want to say.

00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:52.080
I want to spend time alone with him.

00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:54.200
You’re free to go wherever you want, Kian.

00:45:55.170 --> 00:45:56.100
Dinner tomorrow is canceled.

00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:56.850
What did you say?

00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:57.600
You heard me.

00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:04.420
Oh.

00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:06.930
It’d be great

00:46:07.390 --> 00:46:09.050
if you could give me your secretary
as my birthday present.

00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:11.100
In your dreams.

00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:15.650
So mean.

00:46:16.890 --> 00:46:17.800
Both the boss

00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:19.980
and the employee.

00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:35.370
Hang in there, Mok.

00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:37.600
Yes, Boss.

00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:42.110
Mok.

00:46:43.870 --> 00:46:45.030
I need your help with something.

00:46:52.850 --> 00:46:53.800
Here’s some coconut water.

00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:14.540
Damn.

00:47:16.190 --> 00:47:17.200
Hurry!

00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:18.270
Hurry, guys!

00:47:18.690 --> 00:47:19.200
Get into position.

00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:49.700
HOPE YOU ENJOY THIS PEACEFUL REST.

00:47:49.930 --> 00:47:52.530
(Hope you enjoy this peaceful rest.)

00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:56.600
(Hope you enjoy this peaceful rest.)

00:47:57.870 --> 00:48:00.500
(Hope you enjoy this peaceful rest.)

00:48:03.150 --> 00:48:04.600
It’s not so peaceful anymore
because of you.

00:48:05.420 --> 00:48:08.050
(Hope you enjoy this peaceful rest.)

00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:11.420
(Hope you enjoy this peaceful rest.)

00:48:26.330 --> 00:48:27.900
Panachakorn from
the Art department, right?

00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:29.700
Yes.

00:48:30.450 --> 00:48:32.300
Why has the work gotten so bad?

00:48:36.770 --> 00:48:39.460
Well, this is just the first draft.

00:48:39.540 --> 00:48:44.700
We included the references we found,
so it might be a bit rough.

00:48:44.850 --> 00:48:47.250
We apologize, President.

00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:48.980
We’ll fix it right away.

00:48:49.090 --> 00:48:50.020
Fix the whole thing.

00:48:52.470 --> 00:48:54.100
I don’t like anything about this work.

00:48:55.260 --> 00:48:58.420
Not even the model’s strand of hair.

00:49:01.100 --> 00:49:02.800
If this had been done by your brother,

00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:06.100
it would've gotten approved more easily.

00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:10.150
You mean Peach?

00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:15.200
Our photographer is still very new.

00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:18.790
The team is still adjusting, President.

00:49:20.650 --> 00:49:22.780
I didn’t realize ARSENI was
a training school.

00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:24.800
I’ll improve myself right away.

00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:29.000
I’ll also learn more about the job
and ask for Peach’s advice.

00:49:31.100 --> 00:49:31.800
You know each other?

00:49:33.170 --> 00:49:34.100
When did you become close?

00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:37.700
Everyone in my field of work
knows who Peach is.

00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:39.870
He’s one of the top photographers
in the country.

00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:43.800
I think this is a great opportunity
for me to get to know him.

00:49:44.850 --> 00:49:46.140
I’m excited just thinking about it.

00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:47.900
You must be so excited, huh?

00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:52.130
If you don’t have
anything better to present,

00:49:53.340 --> 00:49:54.630
don’t show your face to me again.

00:50:15.020 --> 00:50:15.500
Yes?

00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:17.100
Mr. Peachayarat.

00:50:18.180 --> 00:50:19.050
Please call me Peach.

00:50:19.460 --> 00:50:22.110
Alright, what would you like
for dinner, Mr. Peach?

00:50:27.310 --> 00:50:29.900
That man didn’t already
prepare something for me?

00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:37.650
I’ll have stir-fried beef
with basil, then.

00:50:38.310 --> 00:50:38.860
Of course.

00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:44.650
Stir-fried beef with basil and rice,
served with seven levels of fried eggs.

00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:47.500
Okay.

00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:56.350
(Save your smile for my eyes.)

00:50:56.770 --> 00:50:59.100
(Don’t make me jealous of
this piece of paper.)

00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:01.700
I’m not smiling.

00:51:15.250 --> 00:51:17.900
(I hope you feel good
every ‘thee’ you think of me.)

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:33.340
Hmm?

00:51:33.630 --> 00:51:35.570
OISHI GREEN THEE

00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:36.600
Seriously?

00:51:47.830 --> 00:51:51.460
(What? Just seeing my name
makes you smile that much?)

00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:53.200
Is he crazy?

00:51:57.020 --> 00:51:58.600
(You sound so cheerful.)

00:51:59.030 --> 00:52:02.100
(I bet you’re fully rested, unlike me,
who just got scolded by the boss.)

00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:06.000
Really? Which boss?

00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:07.900
Why are your bosses so strict?

00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:10.500
(Mr. Theerakit, of course.)

00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:11.650
Huh?

00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:15.600
I thought you said if you’re not
senior management,

00:52:15.620 --> 00:52:16.700
you don’t get to see him.

00:52:16.990 --> 00:52:19.100
Why did he suddenly
look at your work himself?

00:52:19.510 --> 00:52:24.300
(I don’t know. Since Wiwid disappeared,
he's been overseeing the work himself.)

00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:28.100
(Note, Nuch, and I
are still jumping out of our skin.)

00:52:28.540 --> 00:52:31.100
There, there. Let me handle it.

00:52:31.370 --> 00:52:33.000
(How are you going to handle it?)

00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:36.900
Oh.

00:52:37.780 --> 00:52:39.700
I’m going to curse him.

00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:42.200
What else can I do?

00:52:42.540 --> 00:52:43.600
That’s the only thing I can do.

00:52:44.370 --> 00:52:47.600
I don’t dare do anything
to Mr. Theerakit Kian Lee.

00:52:48.820 --> 00:52:54.500
(Anyway, Mr. Thee said in the meeting
that he liked your work.)

00:52:56.160 --> 00:53:00.700
(Oh, Trend, the new photographer
wants your contact.)

00:53:00.870 --> 00:53:03.400
(I think he wants to ask you about work.
Can I give it to him?)

00:53:03.870 --> 00:53:04.500
Sure.

00:53:05.450 --> 00:53:06.500
(Enjoy your vacation.)

00:53:06.990 --> 00:53:08.100
(I need to get back to work.)

00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:09.090
Okay.

00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:10.650
Take care of yourself, Plub.

00:53:11.110 --> 00:53:13.200
(You’re the one who should
take care of yourself, Peach.)

00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:26.290
HI, PEACH.
I’M TREND. :)

00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:21.740
Hey.

00:54:22.370 --> 00:54:22.930
Shit.

00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:26.300
Shit!

00:54:28.750 --> 00:54:29.400
Mr. Thee!

00:54:39.150 --> 00:54:40.670
What are you doing here?

00:54:41.060 --> 00:54:42.400
And why did you swim from the shore?

00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:45.600
My plan today got canceled,

00:54:46.460 --> 00:54:47.550
so I flew to see you.

00:54:48.270 --> 00:54:49.150
In your private jet?

00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:51.070
No.

00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:53.350
I researched carefully and learned that

00:54:54.020 --> 00:54:56.900
a private jet creates 10 times
more pollution than a regular plane.

00:54:58.210 --> 00:55:00.500
Now I understand why you don’t like it.

00:55:03.990 --> 00:55:04.800
Very good.

00:55:06.350 --> 00:55:07.100
Sit back and relax.

00:55:08.660 --> 00:55:10.900
Let me take you on a tour.

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:33.720
It’s pretty nice being
in the middle of the sea.

00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:36.220
It’s humbling.

00:55:38.910 --> 00:55:39.850
You like the sea?

00:55:41.810 --> 00:55:43.530
Actually, I like anywhere that’s peaceful.

00:55:44.140 --> 00:55:44.890
Including the sea.

00:55:49.220 --> 00:55:52.400
In that case, you can come here anytime.

00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:55.500
Bring your sister or anyone you want.

00:55:57.020 --> 00:55:58.000
This place is yours.

00:56:00.190 --> 00:56:01.760
You’re unbelievable.

00:56:02.510 --> 00:56:04.700
Stop randomly giving people things.

00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:07.200
If you were my son,
I’d smack some sense into you.

00:56:10.420 --> 00:56:11.400
I don’t want to be your son.

00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:20.420
The sea here is really beautiful, though.

00:56:24.620 --> 00:56:26.900
Wherever I look, it stretches
as far as the eye can see.

00:56:30.290 --> 00:56:31.500
No wonder people call the ocean mighty.

00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:35.900
It’s really beautiful.

00:56:37.170 --> 00:56:37.650
Hmm?

00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:42.750
Especially the ocean
reflected in your eyes.

00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:46.530
It’s so beautiful,
I really can’t look away.

00:56:54.990 --> 00:56:55.940
Is this too close?

00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:03.970
Besides the words “Thank you” and “Sorry”,
do you remember what else

00:57:05.660 --> 00:57:07.200
you’ve taught me, Peachayarat?

00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:10.200
When have I taught you anything?

00:57:14.820 --> 00:57:16.000
If I kissed you right now,

00:57:19.140 --> 00:57:20.600
would that be taking liberties with you?

00:57:22.410 --> 00:57:25.450
People don’t just grab someone’s hand
and do that without their consent.

00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:28.700
But you’re Peach, not just anyone.

00:57:28.900 --> 00:57:31.300
But even people who know each other
wouldn’t do that. It’s weird!

00:57:32.050 --> 00:57:34.600
Some would even think
you’re taking liberties with them.

00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:39.850
If you get consent from the person,

00:57:41.830 --> 00:57:42.650
then it’s not taking liberties.

00:57:44.340 --> 00:57:45.050
In that case,

00:57:49.990 --> 00:57:54.100
may I take liberties with you?

00:58:47.220 --> 00:58:48.600
How could you let him go out there alone?

00:58:48.700 --> 00:58:49.800
Where’s the boat? Is it ready yet?

00:58:50.700 --> 00:58:51.660
It’s coming, Boss.

00:58:57.980 --> 00:58:58.900
I can’t wait any longer.

00:59:04.130 --> 00:59:05.600
The boat is here, Boss!

00:59:06.050 --> 00:59:06.540
Boss!

00:59:13.250 --> 00:59:13.870
Boss!

00:59:15.570 --> 00:59:16.420
Boss!

00:59:16.490 --> 00:59:17.130
Boss!

00:59:19.400 --> 00:59:20.630
Boss!

00:59:23.870 --> 00:59:24.310
Shit!

00:59:26.690 --> 00:59:27.250
Mr. Thee!

00:59:29.500 --> 00:59:30.220
I’m Rome.

00:59:30.460 --> 00:59:31.560
Kian’s younger brother.

00:59:31.710 --> 00:59:32.750
Is it Mr. Rome’s birthday today?

00:59:32.770 --> 00:59:33.300
Yes.

00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:34.620
Then we must find a cake.

00:59:34.700 --> 00:59:37.400
Mr. Thee and Mr. Krit
are not allowed to celebrate.

00:59:37.560 --> 00:59:38.200
It’s a rule.

00:59:38.440 --> 00:59:39.500
Get ready.

00:59:39.570 --> 00:59:42.770
Starting tomorrow,
I’m going full force in chasing you.

00:59:42.940 --> 00:59:44.020
It really suits you.

00:59:44.340 --> 00:59:46.860
I thought you were taking a break
from matters of the heart.

00:59:47.700 --> 00:59:50.200
What would you say if I told you…

00:59:50.430 --> 00:59:52.090
I’ve accidentally caught feelings
for someone?
