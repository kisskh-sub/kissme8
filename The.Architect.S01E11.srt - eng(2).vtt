00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:11.560
Where is she?

00:00:16.879 --> 00:00:17.679
It's you?

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.039
Your Lordship, are you shocked

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.920
that the drug you gave me
wasn't strong enough?

00:00:23.411 --> 00:00:24.160
Drug?

00:00:24.879 --> 00:00:26.320
If you intend to help Li Wan'er,

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.039
why did you act before me?

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.200
What's going on?

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:39.119
The servants of the residence told me
that you gave me a box.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.359
I passed out after I opened it.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:42.560
Then, I was brought here.

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:46.000
I never asked my servants
to do such a thing.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.075
Regardless of whether you did it or not,

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.240
I've let you have a taste
of your own medicine

00:00:56.712 --> 00:00:58.079
and knocked out Li Wan'er.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.920
When is the auction going to start?

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.079
What's the rush?

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.520
It will begin soon.

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:04.370
I've been waiting for half a day.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.200
If I didn't wake up in time,

00:01:09.239 --> 00:01:10.879
I would be the one being appraised.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:12.719
Come back with me.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.480
I'll give you an explanation.

Get your money ready.

We will begin soon.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.000
The auction begins.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.960
I bid 2,000 taels!

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:18.800
2,000 taels!

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.960
I bid 5,000 taels!

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:20.680
5,000 taels!

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.800
Any higher bids?

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:22.599
7,000 taels!

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:24.520
7,000 taels! Any higher bids?

This young master bids 10,000 taels!

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:32.560
Any higher bids?

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.639
12,000 taels!

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.800
You have good taste, Sir!

Tonight's top courtesan

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.120
belongs to you, Master Liu.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.390
If you want to leave,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.690
I will bring you
out of this place safely.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.400
What do you mean, Your Lordship?

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:02.199
Is someone going to stop me?

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:08.599
Master Liu, you are lucky.

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:11.879
Congratulations, Official Liu.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:17.639
Master Liu,

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:19.719
I guarantee it's worth what you paid.

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.599
Come.

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:22.319
Raise the curtain

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.439
and let Master Liu appraise the goods.

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:31.039
How dare you!

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.120
I am the current princess,

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.639
and the emperor's foster daughter!

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:37.199
How dare you treat me rudely!

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:38.280
Seriously?

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:40.159
Princess?

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:41.639
Calm down, Miss.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.280
If you serve Master Liu,

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.439
I'm sure your life

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:45.879
will be better than a princess's.

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:46.840
Just follow Master Liu

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.319
and you can enjoy all things in life!

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.199
Isn't it better
than your current situation?

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:51.360
Master Liu is rich!

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.960
Yes!

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.599
Exactly!

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:55.360
I will gouge all your eyes

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:56.919
and cut all your tongues!

00:03:56.919 --> 00:03:57.730
She's a feisty one.

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:59.159
How interesting.

00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:00.680
I like her.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.680
Pretty,

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.319
I'm coming for you.

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:14.039
What are you doing?

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:19.639
This...

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:20.759
Who is this?

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:25.959
I said

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.240
I'd gouge all your eyes

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:29.879
and cut all your tongues!

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.879
How can I go back on my word?

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.360
Your Highness!

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.639
Your Highness, please spare me!

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.360
Your Highness, spare me!

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.879
If I knew you were the princess,

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:40.519
I'd never do it
no matter how brave I am.

00:04:40.519 --> 00:04:41.639
Your Highness, I beg you.

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:42.279
Spare me.

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:42.879
Do it!

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:44.720
Your Highness, spare me!

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.160
You didn't even blink
when you tried to harm me.

00:04:52.079 --> 00:04:53.879
Why are you trying to kill others

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.250
when you are the one
being viewed and appraised now?

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.360
Wretch.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.199
Who do you think you are?

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.600
Not only am I going to kill you today,

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.839
but I want everyone here

00:05:05.287 --> 00:05:06.480
to die with you.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.759
Your Highness, spare me!

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:12.079
You've been humiliated

00:05:12.399 --> 00:05:13.680
yet you still don't hold back.

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:16.040
You only want
to take other people's lives.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.637
Not only does the Princess of Daliang

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.040
not contribute to the kingdom,

00:05:21.625 --> 00:05:24.160
but she also wants
the people's blood on her hands.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.600
How dare you call yourself
a member of Daliang's royalty?

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:29.439
Preposterous!

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.839
You are just a courtesan in a brothel.

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:37.800
How dare you reprimand me?

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:39.600
Today,

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.120
I will cut off all your tongues!

00:05:41.959 --> 00:05:43.720
I want all of you to reincarnate

00:05:44.079 --> 00:05:45.000
as mutes.

00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:46.800
Li Wan'er.

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:49.079
You can kill us,

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.790
but you can't stop the people
from saying what they want.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.279
Even if everyone here is dead,

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.160
your evil deeds today

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.120
will be spread around the world.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.079
Kill them!

00:06:08.959 --> 00:06:10.120
Who dares kill her?

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:11.519
Yu.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:17.720
Yu.

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:19.079
Don't look at me.

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:20.920
When I'm around,

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:22.600
anyone who acts recklessly

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.990
will be punished for the crime
of harming the common people.

00:06:30.519 --> 00:06:31.360
Li Wan'er,

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.240
you are no longer

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.560
the princess I know.

00:06:50.839 --> 00:06:52.199
You came back for them.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.240
Aren't you afraid of exposing yourself
before Li Wan'er?

00:06:55.639 --> 00:06:57.240
No one knows the feeling

00:06:57.741 --> 00:06:58.720
of being trampled on

00:06:59.519 --> 00:07:01.519
with no right to explain
more than I do.

00:07:04.399 --> 00:07:05.040
However,

00:07:06.319 --> 00:07:07.279
as the princess,

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:09.950
I'm sure
she won't just give up so easily.

00:07:11.325 --> 00:07:13.044
She will probably
complain to the emperor.

00:07:14.519 --> 00:07:16.360
Are you worried
that you might get me involved?

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.240
With you protecting me,

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.040
we will rise

00:07:29.759 --> 00:07:30.800
and fall together.

00:07:33.639 --> 00:07:34.680
Nanny, harder.

00:07:34.879 --> 00:07:35.839
Wipe it off.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:37.279
(Ugly)
Sure.

00:07:38.375 --> 00:07:38.912
(Ugly)

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.120
How dare a lowly courtesan

00:07:40.439 --> 00:07:42.759
do such a thing to the princess?

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.439
She can't atone for her crime
even if she dies 100 times.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:51.120
You...

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:52.040
How dare you

00:07:52.279 --> 00:07:54.000
trespass on
the Mistress's room at night?

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:54.839
Your Highness.

00:07:55.319 --> 00:07:58.680
The Governor orders me to remove
all of Your Highness' belongings

00:07:58.839 --> 00:08:00.319
from the Governor's Residence.

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:02.879
You...

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:04.560
How dare you!

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:07.510
The emperor granted the marriage
between the Governor and me.

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:08.639
I'll see who dares do that!

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.639
Your Highness
received the royal family's grace

00:08:11.079 --> 00:08:12.360
yet you can't endure others.

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:15.000
You've tried to harm the women
of this residence multiple times

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:16.782
and caused chaos
at the Governor's Residence.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.900
The Governor asked me
to inform Your Highness

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.390
that the residence cannot afford
to handle the princess.

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:23.120
Move.

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:23.720
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:26.480
Nanny!

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:29.759
Your Highness.

00:08:30.279 --> 00:08:31.000
It's all right.

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:37.240
I...

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.360
I was rude.

00:08:58.430 --> 00:08:59.879
I shouldn't argue with the princess.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.600
With Her Highness' status as a royalty,

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.879
she is the most suitable candidate

00:09:05.279 --> 00:09:06.600
to be Your Lordship's wife.

00:09:10.399 --> 00:09:12.759
When will you face me
with your true identity?

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.279
I wonder what you mean?

00:09:21.639 --> 00:09:23.960
You always seek revenge
and use all possible tricks.

00:09:24.679 --> 00:09:27.120
You didn't even care
about the Governor's Residence's Madam.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:30.679
Why do you pretend to be a concubine

00:09:30.679 --> 00:09:31.919
who only flatters me?

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.240
Regardless of your identity,

00:09:37.559 --> 00:09:38.360
you can tell me

00:09:38.879 --> 00:09:40.360
any request you have.

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:43.293
As long as I can give it to you,
I won't be stingy about it.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:45.519
Can you give me anything?

00:09:46.879 --> 00:09:47.799
Anything.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:49.600
Does it include your life?

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.120
Come and take it anytime.

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:55.440
Your Lordship,
there's no need to flatter me.

00:09:57.279 --> 00:09:58.639
One day, you will believe

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.080
that you won't have to

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.600
put on a facade
to protect yourself before me.

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.080
One day,

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:12.100
Your Lordship will also understand

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.440
that there is something

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:16.400
that I can't afford to ask for

00:10:16.925 --> 00:10:17.840
because I can't take it

00:10:18.919 --> 00:10:19.879
and it isn't necessary.

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:23.040
For the sake
of the Governor's Residence,

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:25.190
Your Lordship should think of a way
to resolve this.

I grant Wan'er to you

Lord Pei,

00:12:10.679 --> 00:12:11.879
are you feeling reluctant?

She's just a concubine.

00:12:30.279 --> 00:12:31.600
Why would I feel reluctant?

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:39.759
Your Lordship.

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:43.680
You got arrogant because I spoiled you
and went against the princess.
