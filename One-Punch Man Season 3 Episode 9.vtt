00:14.620 --> 00:18.000
Why didn't you stay and
fight that guy with your robot?

00:18.290 --> 00:19.750
It looked like you could win.

00:20.170 --> 00:21.630
That monster is strong.

00:22.040 --> 00:24.130
Fighting it would take time
and besides

00:24.170 --> 00:25.630
winning isn't what's important.

00:25.920 --> 00:29.340
Why not? Taking down monsters
is a hero's job!

00:29.470 --> 00:30.630
Daddy said so!

00:31.010 --> 00:33.350
That's right, but...

00:33.760 --> 00:37.930
Getting you to the surface
is my mission.

00:39.100 --> 00:40.940
Now is not the time to fight.

00:41.270 --> 00:42.730
Fine...

00:42.940 --> 00:45.520
I'm exhausted!
But let's rest a little bit.

00:46.030 --> 00:47.740
My legs are totally worn out.

00:48.740 --> 00:50.780
Eeek! A monster?!

00:51.610 --> 00:54.410
Don't worry.
That's a monster I killed earlier.

00:55.240 --> 00:58.620
Hey, that looks like Donkan Bird!

01:00.920 --> 01:03.670
Come to think of it,
he did mention an animal costume.

01:04.420 --> 01:06.170
Is that a famous character?

01:06.750 --> 01:11.050
It's the mascot from the comedy show 
 "Animal Empire" that aired a while back.

01:11.720 --> 01:15.720
Donkan Bird is thick-headed and stupid,
so he always dies.

01:16.430 --> 01:17.770
Always dies?

01:18.470 --> 01:20.600
Yeah! But he's really thick-headed.

01:21.270 --> 01:24.770
So he always comes back to life in
the next episode as if nothing happened.

01:25.860 --> 01:27.320
Comes back to life...

01:27.860 --> 01:30.440
Well...it was just a TV show.

01:31.400 --> 01:33.910
<i>Monster behavior is unpredictable.</i>

01:34.030 --> 01:37.280
<i>We don't even know what triggers them</i>
<i>or what their origins really are.</i>

01:38.120 --> 01:40.370
<i>What if the man who became</i>
<i>a monster by wearing a costume</i>

01:40.500 --> 01:43.370
<i>had continued living</i>
<i>as the character itself?</i>

01:50.590 --> 01:52.260
Gyoro-Gyoro said...

01:53.470 --> 01:56.510
You must overcome a hell
that pushes you to death's edge.

01:57.510 --> 02:01.850
That is the secret to
a monster's explosive growth.

02:06.230 --> 02:10.900
{\an8}THREAT LEVEL: DRAGON
{\an8}RESURRECTED PHOENIX MAN

03:48.460 --> 03:49.750
Birdlime Shotgun!

03:54.760 --> 03:55.670
A heat blast?!

03:55.800 --> 03:56.630
Get down!

04:04.060 --> 04:05.350
Stay here and don't move.

04:07.020 --> 04:09.440
What are you gonna do?
Don't leave me!

04:10.150 --> 04:14.020
<i>I'm all out of Underdog Men,</i>
<i>so I'll have to fight it myself.</i>

04:20.070 --> 04:23.740
{\an8}BRAVE CHILD

04:21.529 --> 04:24.200
I'll defeat this creep one more time!

04:33.210 --> 04:35.130
Transparent film again?

04:35.550 --> 04:37.090
I'll find out...

04:37.210 --> 04:39.880
by using Beak Attack again!

04:40.430 --> 04:43.180
You've got a lot of confidence
for someone who just lost.

04:43.600 --> 04:44.430
<i>Come on.</i>

04:44.760 --> 04:48.350
Phoenix Explosion Beak Attack!

04:52.100 --> 04:54.360
<i>He penetrated all of them?</i>
<i>That's crazy. </i>

05:00.150 --> 05:01.110
Child Emperor?

05:02.110 --> 05:04.030
Indeed. I am stronger.

05:04.740 --> 05:06.370
This feeling of omnipotence.

05:06.540 --> 05:09.580
Now everything I see appears
to glow.

05:09.910 --> 05:13.880
At this very moment, it appears
that I am the mightiest of them all.

05:14.250 --> 05:15.210
I am...

05:15.380 --> 05:19.630
I am number one among
all living things.

05:23.590 --> 05:24.510
Don't cry.

05:24.510 --> 05:28.180
This time, I'll kill you
before you have time to feel fear.

05:28.560 --> 05:31.100
I'm not crying because I'm scared.

05:31.230 --> 05:33.850
I'm furious at my own weakness.

05:34.770 --> 05:38.230
You're not even a top ranker
and you surpassed my expectations...

05:39.400 --> 05:41.700
This wasn't supposed to happen...

05:42.030 --> 05:43.530
Not here...

05:45.490 --> 05:49.410
I can't believe I already have
to use my ultimate weapon.

05:52.330 --> 05:54.500
Come on! Brave Giant!

06:07.350 --> 06:08.220
Here I come!

06:21.860 --> 06:23.650
Just in case something
like this happened

06:23.780 --> 06:26.780
I planted parts underground
ahead of time.

06:27.410 --> 06:28.740
What the heck?

06:28.870 --> 06:31.370
If you had that, you shoulda
used it from the start!

06:33.120 --> 06:34.160
He has a point...

06:34.460 --> 06:36.830
Once you rescued the hostage
the smartest move would've been

06:36.830 --> 06:40.340
to summon that thing
and escape immediately.

06:40.880 --> 06:42.920
But the fact that you didn't
means it must have

06:42.970 --> 06:46.050
some major limitations on
when it can be used?

06:47.260 --> 06:48.390
<i>There's no time!</i>

06:48.510 --> 06:50.510
<i>I need to finish this</i>
<i>once and for all.</i>

06:56.350 --> 06:57.650
Divider Shield.

07:08.700 --> 07:10.120
Homing Missiles!

07:12.450 --> 07:14.000
Phoenix Flares!

07:15.910 --> 07:18.420
Damn it! Delta Scale Saber!

07:21.210 --> 07:24.880
I don't know how that costume works,
but it's got decent speed.

07:25.090 --> 07:27.050
But...
You're out of sync.

07:27.470 --> 07:32.640
Behold the ensemble I weave
in perfect sync with Donkan Bird!

07:33.020 --> 07:35.770
Phoenix Fire Falcon Mode.

07:38.650 --> 07:39.980
Did he just speed up?!

07:42.320 --> 07:44.860
Phoenix Heat Up Talons Attack!

07:45.320 --> 07:46.570
Take that!

07:47.700 --> 07:48.570
What's the matter?

07:48.700 --> 07:52.160
You'll never make it as a first-class
costume actor if you keep that up!

07:52.700 --> 07:55.660
Shut up! Go!! Little Braves!!

07:55.700 --> 07:56.910
Mobiii!

07:59.630 --> 08:01.040
All Range Attack!

08:04.590 --> 08:07.720
Phoenix Prominence Hawk Mode!

08:12.300 --> 08:13.810
No way! He absorbed it?

08:14.470 --> 08:15.470
Here's your payback!

08:20.600 --> 08:22.270
Super Vibration Blade!

08:25.530 --> 08:27.860
<i>I have to hurry...</i>
<i>I have to finish him quickly.</i>

08:28.200 --> 08:30.660
<i>After three minutes,</i>
<i>I'll lose control of its energy...</i>

08:31.110 --> 08:32.909
<i>He's in a rush to settle this.</i>

08:33.120 --> 08:36.330
<i>Just as I thought, it's a weapon</i>
<i>that can't stay active long.</i>

08:38.080 --> 08:39.750
Then take this!

08:40.330 --> 08:43.380
Phoenix Homing Wing Attack!

08:46.960 --> 08:47.880
Oh no!

08:51.180 --> 08:52.510
Child Emperor!

08:58.480 --> 09:01.810
<i>Heh, I'll force him to use</i>
<i>his precious trump card right here.</i>

09:02.020 --> 09:04.150
<i>I'll keep firing homing missiles</i>
<i>while staying hidden</i>

09:04.150 --> 09:05.520
<i>until his time limit runs out.</i>

09:07.030 --> 09:07.900
Found you.

09:10.110 --> 09:10.950
What?

09:11.240 --> 09:12.490
I knew you'd try that.

09:12.610 --> 09:15.950
This Irritating Electromagnetic Shield is
100 times stronger than my usual one.

09:16.200 --> 09:17.620
I can't break free!!

09:18.580 --> 09:19.580
This is the end!

09:19.790 --> 09:21.870
Giant Fist Strike!

09:22.250 --> 09:23.420
You cocky little brat!

09:26.630 --> 09:27.590
He took the punch?!

09:30.840 --> 09:33.430
<i>Output limit.</i>
<i>Cooling system damaged.</i>

09:38.100 --> 09:41.520
Over-booster enabled.
Output restriction lifted.

09:51.110 --> 09:53.740
<i>Hyper Degenerate Battery</i>
<i>nearing explosion.</i>

09:54.320 --> 09:55.870
<i>Evacuate immediately...</i>

09:56.530 --> 09:59.160
<i>He grows stronger by the second.</i>

09:59.450 --> 10:02.750
<i>If I don't take him down for good,</i>
<i>I won't be able to protect Waganma!</i>

10:04.460 --> 10:06.000
<i>That incredible speed is most likely...</i>

10:07.090 --> 10:08.380
<i>This is my last chance.</i>

10:08.630 --> 10:11.010
<i>I'll link up with him so we can</i>
<i>take this guy down together!</i>

10:17.430 --> 10:19.720
Crap. I knew it. He resurrects, after all.

10:20.680 --> 10:21.730
The signal is close.

10:22.770 --> 10:24.940
Flash! Where are you?!

10:37.530 --> 10:38.530
What...?!

10:40.830 --> 10:42.040
What is this place?!

10:42.620 --> 10:44.330
Why is the transmitter here?

10:44.920 --> 10:46.790
Don't tell me they took down Flash?!

10:50.750 --> 10:52.420
I have to thank you,
Child Emperor.

10:55.010 --> 10:57.640
You may be just a kid,
but you're still a Class-S hero.

10:57.800 --> 11:02.220
An ordinary opponent could never
have pushed me to evolve this far.

11:02.850 --> 11:04.690
H-He's still...

11:05.140 --> 11:07.310
Child Emperor, we should escape
while we still can!

11:07.310 --> 11:08.270
Come on!

11:08.360 --> 11:11.650
No, if he's still trying to raise
his threat level

11:11.780 --> 11:13.150
we need to end this now!

11:16.530 --> 11:18.320
<i>Even after the show was cancelled</i>

11:18.370 --> 11:21.910
<i>Donkan Bird wouldn’t</i>
<i>let me take off the costume.</i>

11:22.450 --> 11:25.120
<i>Day by day,</i>
<i>I felt myself becoming less human.</i>

11:25.540 --> 11:27.500
<i>The costume began</i>
<i>communicating with me.</i>

11:28.170 --> 11:30.420
Beam Engraver!

11:31.250 --> 11:34.630
<i>Freed from all restraints,</i>
<i>I will become an eternal being.</i>

11:35.720 --> 11:39.260
<i>It is now our turn to take</i>
<i>center stage in this world.</i>

11:39.720 --> 11:42.720
<i>My costume and I were killed</i>
<i>over and over again...</i>

11:43.850 --> 11:45.980
But this is our victory
born of pure determination!

11:46.890 --> 11:49.860
Phoenix Brilliant Eagle Mode!

11:50.270 --> 11:51.270
He took the attack?!

11:54.650 --> 11:56.490
I'm taking back the hostage.

11:59.820 --> 12:01.530
<i>C-Crap.</i>

12:01.780 --> 12:05.410
<i>Water leakage detected.</i>
<i>Injecting rubber into damaged areas.</i>

12:05.910 --> 12:07.370
You lost.

12:07.660 --> 12:11.080
I'm sure you became a hero
to get praised...

12:11.080 --> 12:12.040
but give it up.

12:12.250 --> 12:13.750
We're not even in the same league.

12:13.840 --> 12:16.340
I told you we should've escaped!

12:16.670 --> 12:18.720
Don't lump me in with you!

12:19.220 --> 12:21.970
I'm not a hero just for show.

12:22.430 --> 12:25.060
I'm way more tenacious
than some phoenix!

12:25.850 --> 12:30.190
Oh, I thought you'd simply give up
the fight if your chances were zero.

12:30.560 --> 12:31.940
You're still wet behind the ears.

12:32.440 --> 12:34.520
Sorry, but I'm not gonna waste
my time for a fight

12:34.520 --> 12:35.900
if I have no chance of winning.

12:36.230 --> 12:37.570
Putting on a brave face, huh?

12:38.150 --> 12:41.030
<i>Armor, attack power and mobility...</i>

12:41.570 --> 12:44.200
<i>This isn't some joke monster</i>
<i>that got stuck in a suit.</i>

12:44.200 --> 12:45.490
<i>He's got incredible specs.</i>

12:46.160 --> 12:48.910
<i>He's even figured out that</i>
<i>my robot has almost reached its limit. </i>

12:49.870 --> 12:52.080
<i>But I'm not out of options yet.</i>

12:52.750 --> 12:56.000
Hm? Corpses of the previous inhabitants?

12:56.300 --> 12:57.210
That's perfect.

12:57.550 --> 12:59.420
To thank you for helping me evolve

12:59.420 --> 13:02.090
I'll show you the new abilities
of this mode.

13:05.350 --> 13:07.270
What is that? A ray gun?

13:07.890 --> 13:09.600
Eeek! It's blinding!

13:10.140 --> 13:11.190
I call it...

13:11.190 --> 13:13.190
"The Light of the New King's Awakening."

13:17.440 --> 13:18.360
Awakening...?

13:24.030 --> 13:26.080
Z-Z-Zombies?!

13:26.370 --> 13:28.200
Is this some kind of superpower?

13:30.210 --> 13:32.710
This is the immortal phoenix,
living up to its name.

13:33.080 --> 13:35.380
According to what the costume
has whispered to me

13:35.500 --> 13:38.960
if I push my life energy to its limits,
and radiate it outwards

13:38.960 --> 13:42.220
it can somehow trigger
pseudo-life activity!

13:42.720 --> 13:44.220
I don't really get it myself.

13:44.470 --> 13:45.720
What the hell?

14:00.530 --> 14:02.400
Oh! Nice moves.

14:02.610 --> 14:04.490
Feels like the fit has improved,
hasn't it?

14:05.070 --> 14:07.490
Good. I feel it, I feel it!

14:08.160 --> 14:10.540
Hatred, regret, helplessness...

14:10.910 --> 14:12.830
Let them build up inside me!

14:15.250 --> 14:19.420
<i>I said, you're fired.</i>
<i>You got that, Donkan?</i>

14:20.210 --> 14:22.470
In that case,
you may not be able

14:22.880 --> 14:24.630
to take that thing off either.

14:25.140 --> 14:27.300
Child Emperor!

14:27.720 --> 14:29.350
Hang on, Waganma!

14:29.720 --> 14:31.270
I'm coming for you now.

14:33.100 --> 14:36.400
Now then, I'll just watch
from the sidelines.

14:36.560 --> 14:37.440
Oh, wait.

14:43.530 --> 14:45.280
<i>I feel like a god.</i>

14:45.450 --> 14:48.740
<i>Not even Gyoro-Gyoro nor the Monster King</i>
<i>could ever possess such power!</i>

14:51.120 --> 14:52.040
Just in time!

14:53.160 --> 14:56.000
Mere insects, huh?
What powerful support.

14:56.330 --> 14:57.250
Transform!

14:57.380 --> 14:58.710
Underground Mole Mode!

15:09.680 --> 15:11.390
Soccer Shoot!

15:11.850 --> 15:12.680
All right!

15:14.390 --> 15:15.770
Your petty tricks.

15:16.350 --> 15:17.350
Ten more seconds.

15:17.730 --> 15:18.650
<i>Warning!</i>

15:19.230 --> 15:22.070
<i>Focusing energy</i>
<i>on this attack will place</i>

15:22.190 --> 15:23.940
<i>excessive strain on all systems.</i>

15:24.030 --> 15:25.570
Focus only on the arms and thrusters.

15:25.570 --> 15:27.070
Forget about maintaining the body.

15:27.240 --> 15:28.320
I just need five seconds.

15:28.780 --> 15:29.910
Maximum power!!

15:30.030 --> 15:32.580
Break down the enemy forces
on the unit's surface!

15:36.290 --> 15:38.420
Giga Volt Smash!

15:51.760 --> 15:54.180
Combine! Side-Arm Mode!

16:00.230 --> 16:01.110
An Arm...

16:04.070 --> 16:05.110
Now I can shoot...!!

16:07.820 --> 16:10.320
Millennium Emperor Nova!!

16:11.490 --> 16:14.200
You insolent brat!
I'll absorb it all!

16:14.330 --> 16:16.500
Let's see if you can!

16:19.250 --> 16:21.840
You can do it!
Hold on, Giant!

16:29.930 --> 16:31.090
What the heck is that?

16:31.680 --> 16:33.890
Did a huge excavator
pass through or something?

16:34.060 --> 16:34.890
Hm?

16:54.870 --> 16:57.410
<i>Body damage at 96%.</i>

16:58.330 --> 17:00.040
<i>Shutting down all systems.</i>

17:05.300 --> 17:06.170
What...?

17:06.420 --> 17:08.089
Wait, what? The water...

17:08.380 --> 17:10.800
C-Child Emperor, are you alive?!

17:11.680 --> 17:14.510
<i>I greatly underestimated</i>
<i>the enemy's strength.</i>

17:14.970 --> 17:18.349
<i>I bet Flash didn't even have time</i>
<i>to send a distress signal.</i>

17:19.980 --> 17:21.599
<i>Is everyone really all right?</i>

17:21.640 --> 17:22.690
This is great.

17:22.849 --> 17:25.980
I was starting to get fed up
with this damp and dark place.

17:26.609 --> 17:30.200
It seems even the heavens
are blessing me as the new king.

17:30.990 --> 17:33.280
You did good for a kid.

17:33.990 --> 17:37.490
Look what you've done
to my beloved costume.

17:37.700 --> 17:39.660
That is why I hate kids.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.420
Is it time for me to give up?

17:42.580 --> 17:44.670
Seeing how that didn't work...

17:45.170 --> 17:46.960
You saw Metal Knight, right?

17:47.210 --> 17:51.630
The Monster Association's tech team
will now take you and your toy apart

17:51.630 --> 17:53.640
and study them thoroughly.

17:53.930 --> 17:56.010
Don't test my patience.

17:56.260 --> 17:59.470
If you come out quietly,
I'll make your death quick and easy.

17:59.890 --> 18:01.600
On second thought, forget it.

18:01.850 --> 18:03.560
I won't forgive you, after all.

18:03.810 --> 18:08.070
Bleh! Fine, backup is coming,
so I’m holing up in here.

18:08.320 --> 18:10.990
This protective shell is my masterpiece!

18:13.990 --> 18:15.660
You know about woodpeckers, right?

18:15.780 --> 18:17.490
They peck holes in the body...

18:18.030 --> 18:20.450
and yank out the guts from there.

18:26.750 --> 18:27.670
What the...?

18:35.260 --> 18:36.680
Oh no! Child Emperor!

18:36.890 --> 18:40.180
Did you think hiding in
the robot would do the trick?

18:42.310 --> 18:44.190
Talk about pure desperation.

18:44.560 --> 18:47.190
And now,
it's time for your punishment...

18:51.690 --> 18:53.030
There's something inside...?!

18:53.070 --> 18:56.070
I can't...take...it off!

18:57.780 --> 18:59.370
W-What's wrong with him?

18:59.530 --> 19:01.540
It's Tickle Bug No. 1.

19:01.700 --> 19:03.250
When I trapped him

19:03.290 --> 19:06.620
I slipped it into his costume
through the gap around his face.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.920
It'll crawl inside your clothes and

19:10.040 --> 19:13.420
keep tickling you
until you suffocate and die.

19:13.720 --> 19:15.760
Even I think it's a devilish weapon.

19:16.630 --> 19:20.810
Donkan Bird may be thick-headed,
but he's super sensitive on the inside.

19:21.510 --> 19:23.640
Why you...!

19:24.770 --> 19:25.690
Just as I thought.

19:26.100 --> 19:30.150
I figured you'd be able to tear
that costume off yourself.

19:30.400 --> 19:32.440
Well, I'm glad
you were able to take it off.

19:32.780 --> 19:35.780
<i>Oh no...</i>
<i>The costume is getting weaker...</i>

19:37.320 --> 19:39.200
Gem Buster Attachment!

19:39.740 --> 19:40.990
Child's Play.

19:43.290 --> 19:46.290
Now! I'll rip it away from
where it's come undone.

19:46.750 --> 19:48.250
W-Wait!

19:51.840 --> 19:54.420
Oww... W-What happened?

19:59.800 --> 20:00.720
-Huh?
-Huh?

20:05.810 --> 20:08.140
First, the rumbling, and now a leak?

20:08.230 --> 20:10.270
This better not be sewage.

20:10.730 --> 20:11.560
Hm?

20:12.900 --> 20:14.320
What's going on?

20:14.530 --> 20:17.320
We were fighting Flash
and now, we're naked?

20:17.400 --> 20:19.160
Where did that bastard go?

20:19.280 --> 20:22.580
How dare he humiliate us?
I'll tear him apart.

20:22.780 --> 20:23.790
-Huh?
-Huh?

20:24.040 --> 20:26.410
Who's that? A hero?

20:30.580 --> 20:33.420
What's the big idea?
We just met, right?

20:34.000 --> 20:36.590
Great. Another freak shows up.

20:38.090 --> 20:41.970
You read our moves.
Unforgivable.

20:42.180 --> 20:45.010
Normally,
we wouldn't let you live, but...

20:45.470 --> 20:47.430
But we have a prior engagement
to kill somebody.

20:47.480 --> 20:48.940
We'll save you for later.

20:49.060 --> 20:49.940
We won't forget...

20:49.940 --> 20:50.940
-your face.
-your face.

20:52.730 --> 20:54.520
Why are there
perverts underground?

21:00.660 --> 21:01.740
Did you get him?

21:01.780 --> 21:05.410
Yes... The costume's power
should be gone now.

21:05.580 --> 21:06.830
He won't reincarnate.

21:07.580 --> 21:09.910
You were having a hard time
for a Class-S hero.

21:10.040 --> 21:11.580
I was getting scared.

21:12.080 --> 21:13.790
Come on, get it together.

21:14.380 --> 21:15.550
Yeah...

21:15.840 --> 21:18.510
The enemy was stronger
than I expected, so I panicked a little.

21:18.670 --> 21:21.220
Y-You'd better not lose
till you get me home safe.

21:25.470 --> 21:26.640
This is Child Emperor.

21:26.810 --> 21:29.430
I've secured Waganma and
we're heading to the surface.

21:29.680 --> 21:32.230
Everyone, lure the enemy away,
as planned.

21:33.060 --> 21:35.110
Don't be overeager in pursuing them.

21:35.320 --> 21:36.480
The enemy is dangerous...

21:48.910 --> 21:50.250
<i>This is Zombieman.</i>

21:51.120 --> 21:54.130
<i>Thanks. We couldn't</i>
<i>have done it without you.</i>

21:54.500 --> 21:56.380
<i>Let me thank you</i>
<i>on everyone's behalf.</i>

21:58.250 --> 22:01.380
Thank you.
Be careful, Zombieman.

22:04.720 --> 22:07.600
Oh... I forgot to ask you...

22:08.140 --> 22:12.770
Were you the only one
held captive here?

22:12.980 --> 22:13.810
Uh...

22:15.230 --> 22:16.940
Yeah. I think so...

22:17.400 --> 22:19.110
Then let's go.

22:19.570 --> 22:21.530
I'll protect you
until we get to the exit.

23:56.000 --> 24:00.840
{\an8}IMMORTAL BLOODBATH
