00:38.791 --> 00:40.625
Hard to know where to start.

00:41.833 --> 00:45.250
I guess to tell the story
of the Good Friday murder through my eyes,

00:45.333 --> 00:46.958
I got to start here.

00:47.625 --> 00:51.750
Nine months ago, when this asshole deacon
said something way out of line,

00:51.833 --> 00:53.041
and I did this.

00:58.333 --> 00:59.958
Oh, shit.

01:00.750 --> 01:03.083
So, you're a fighter, then?

01:03.583 --> 01:05.708
Uh, no, Father, absolutely not.

01:05.791 --> 01:09.041
Well, we have a deacon who would say
otherwise if his jaw wasn't broken.

01:09.125 --> 01:11.750
In my previous life, yes, I was a boxer,

01:12.250 --> 01:14.833
and I lived on the streets.
I did some other things.

01:14.916 --> 01:18.708
We need fighters today,
but to fight the world,

01:19.458 --> 01:21.083
not ourselves.

01:21.166 --> 01:24.625
A priest is a shepherd.
The world is a wolf.

01:24.708 --> 01:25.833
No.

01:29.250 --> 01:33.625
I… I don't believe that,
Father, respectfully.

01:33.708 --> 01:36.500
You start fighting wolves,
and before you know it,

01:36.583 --> 01:38.291
everyone you don't understand is a wolf.

01:39.333 --> 01:42.333
I still got that fighting instinct,
and I gave into it today,

01:42.416 --> 01:44.833
but Christ came to heal the world,
not fight it.

01:44.916 --> 01:46.208
I believe that.

01:46.291 --> 01:49.583
It's this, not this, you know?

01:50.833 --> 01:52.666
I just want to be a good priest.

01:53.625 --> 01:56.916
Show broken people like me
the forgiveness and love of Christ.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
The world needs that so bad.

02:01.708 --> 02:04.583
You give me one more shot,
and I promise I'll do that.

02:16.958 --> 02:18.125
Your Excellency,

02:18.833 --> 02:21.041
you stuck your neck out for me
so many times.

02:21.125 --> 02:23.625
-I let you down, and whatever the--
-All right.

02:23.708 --> 02:24.791
Listen…

02:25.291 --> 02:28.250
Deacon Clark is famously a dick.

02:28.333 --> 02:30.791
Nobody's actually that upset
that you clocked him.

02:30.875 --> 02:32.375
In fact, kind of the opposite.

02:32.458 --> 02:35.041
But we do need to do something about it.

02:36.041 --> 02:39.250
We're sending you
to a small parish in Chimney Rock.

02:39.333 --> 02:42.375
It's just one priest there now.

02:43.666 --> 02:45.000
Assistant pastor?

02:45.083 --> 02:47.250
Yeah, well, curb your enthusiasm.

02:47.333 --> 02:48.166
What?

02:48.666 --> 02:53.416
You're going
to Our Lady of Perpetual Fortitude,

02:53.500 --> 02:56.583
led by Monsignor Jefferson Wicks.
Have you heard of Jefferson Wicks?

02:57.458 --> 03:00.958
Okay, look, Wicks has his supporters here.
I'm not one of them.

03:01.041 --> 03:02.125
Between you and me,

03:02.208 --> 03:05.166
I think he's a few beads shy of
a full rosary and a real son of a bitch.

03:06.166 --> 03:10.833
But what's undeniable is that his flock
is shrinking and even calcifying.

03:11.791 --> 03:15.333
It could use some of what
you said in there. You understand?

03:15.958 --> 03:18.291
Not at all, but yes.

03:18.375 --> 03:20.458
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

03:20.541 --> 03:23.416
-Spirit's got me. Let me at him.
-Hey. Hey, hey.

03:23.500 --> 03:27.041
This, not this, right? Mm?

03:31.166 --> 03:32.375
Good luck, kid.

03:38.166 --> 03:40.791
So, that's how I came to Chimney Rock.

03:43.333 --> 03:45.166
Daniel in the lion's den.

03:45.250 --> 03:47.000
David facing off Goliath.

03:47.500 --> 03:49.916
Young, dumb, and full of Christ.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.750
Ready for anything.

04:23.791 --> 04:24.875
Father Jefferson?

04:25.791 --> 04:28.083
Hello. Jud Duplenticy from Albany?

04:28.166 --> 04:30.875
Lord be with you,
Jud Duplenticy from Albany.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.125
You here to take my church away from me?

04:37.458 --> 04:39.250
Oh. No.

04:39.833 --> 04:40.708
Good.

04:41.583 --> 04:44.000
Okay, call me Monsignor Wicks.

04:44.916 --> 04:46.208
I see you've met Martha.

04:47.083 --> 04:48.333
Martha? No.

04:48.416 --> 04:49.916
-Monsignor Wicks.
-Jesus!

04:50.000 --> 04:52.500
I woke up early to polish the silver.

04:52.583 --> 04:53.875
It was a bit blotchy.

04:53.958 --> 04:55.500
That'll be fine, Martha.

04:55.583 --> 04:57.791
Father… Jud.

04:59.083 --> 05:00.375
You are welcome here.

05:00.875 --> 05:02.500
-Thank you, Martha.
-Mm.

05:02.583 --> 05:05.208
I was actually
just saying to Father Wicks…

05:05.291 --> 05:06.875
Monsignor Wicks.

05:07.708 --> 05:09.583
Monsignor, right. Sorry.

05:10.083 --> 05:11.708
And sorry for saying "Jesus".

05:13.500 --> 05:15.666
Hoo. This is going great, I think.

05:15.750 --> 05:18.291
-Bishop Langstrom sent you, huh?
-Mm-hmm.

05:19.166 --> 05:20.250
Langstrom.

05:20.750 --> 05:22.416
I know him well.

05:22.500 --> 05:24.708
He handpicked you, sent you here.

05:25.500 --> 05:27.000
It says something to me.

05:29.583 --> 05:30.791
Tells me a lot.

05:31.916 --> 05:34.708
Well, I… I know
you're used to flying solo, but, um…

05:35.291 --> 05:36.916
I'm… I'm here to serve.

05:38.416 --> 05:39.625
Take my confession.

05:41.291 --> 05:43.083
All right.

05:43.791 --> 05:45.083
Mm.

05:47.166 --> 05:49.708
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

05:49.791 --> 05:51.000
It's been, uh,

05:51.875 --> 05:54.291
six weeks since my last confession.

05:58.708 --> 06:01.250
I've envied the material wealth of others.

06:02.125 --> 06:06.750
I saw this luxury car commercial.
Sam had it on his TV. Lexus.

06:07.416 --> 06:08.625
And I thought,

06:09.125 --> 06:11.875
"Ah! That is a good-looking car."

06:11.958 --> 06:13.458
The coupe.

06:14.583 --> 06:17.958
Uh… I've envied the power of great men.

06:19.375 --> 06:22.750
Envied my grandfather's power as a priest.
I wanted that.

06:22.833 --> 06:24.041
Always did.

06:25.791 --> 06:26.791
Uh…

06:27.541 --> 06:28.958
I've masturbated,

06:30.166 --> 06:33.708
um, four times this week.

06:33.791 --> 06:36.625
Four or five, generally, in…
What'd I say, six weeks?

06:36.708 --> 06:39.791
Well, let's say 30 times, masturbated.

06:40.833 --> 06:44.458
Uh, this week, in my bed,
in the morning once.

06:44.958 --> 06:49.041
Once in the shower, standing up,
which was convenient.

06:49.125 --> 06:51.250
Just use a bath gel.

06:52.333 --> 06:55.541
Oh, once in the middle of the night,
after a dream about--

06:55.625 --> 06:58.208
-That's all right.
-About one of those Japanese cat cafés.

06:58.291 --> 07:00.625
-Okay.
-You know, I read this article,

07:00.708 --> 07:05.916
but the cats were girls,
and, you know, so…

07:06.583 --> 07:08.000
And I hadn't prepared,

07:08.083 --> 07:12.125
so I had to finish into a copy
of Catholic Chronicle magazine,

07:12.833 --> 07:16.916
just what was on the end table,
which is probably its own kind of sin.

07:17.416 --> 07:20.416
I don't know, maybe not, but… Not good.

07:21.541 --> 07:23.833
At the time,
I thought this was just weird.

07:24.833 --> 07:26.916
But looking back now, I know.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.333
This was Wicks' first punch.

07:29.416 --> 07:31.458
Five Hail Marys and one Glory Be.

07:33.166 --> 07:34.458
Thank you, Father.

07:40.041 --> 07:41.541
It wouldn't be his last.

07:41.625 --> 07:42.875
Oh, and welcome

07:43.666 --> 07:45.083
to my church.

07:48.750 --> 07:51.208
Over the next few weeks, I settled in

07:51.291 --> 07:53.500
at Our Lady of Perpetual Fortitude.

07:59.166 --> 08:03.791
The only other full-time employee
was the groundskeeper, Samson.

08:04.500 --> 08:05.583
Sam.

08:11.125 --> 08:12.833
It's Monsignor Wicks

08:12.916 --> 08:17.000
who gives me the strength every day
to not go back to the bottle.

08:17.916 --> 08:19.041
He used to drink too.

08:20.125 --> 08:24.083
But he said to me once,
"If I can stave off that demon, you can."

08:25.375 --> 08:27.291
And every day, it is a struggle.

08:28.166 --> 08:29.250
But I have.

08:30.541 --> 08:34.041
I credit him and… my sweet Martha.

08:34.125 --> 08:36.625
Your… your sweet Martha?

08:36.708 --> 08:38.333
I'd do anything for her.

08:39.708 --> 08:42.083
My angel on Earth.

08:42.166 --> 08:45.458
As far as the church goes,
Martha does it all.

08:45.541 --> 08:48.750
She keeps the books,
manages donations, files everything.

08:48.833 --> 08:49.958
File that.

08:50.541 --> 08:52.958
She launders the vestments,
stocks the supplies,

08:53.041 --> 08:55.166
feeds Wicks, plays the organ.

08:58.875 --> 09:00.791
She knew where the bodies were buried.

09:01.583 --> 09:03.666
-So this is the crypt?
-Yep.

09:03.750 --> 09:06.708
It's a damn shame.
Gotta put up a security camera.

09:07.208 --> 09:09.333
-Is there an entrance?
-There is.

09:10.500 --> 09:11.708
This right here,

09:12.208 --> 09:13.333
it's a Lazarus door.

09:14.041 --> 09:16.916
Takes construction equipment
to open from the outside.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.875
But cantilevered as such that one push

09:20.458 --> 09:22.875
will send it tumbling
to the ground from inside.

09:24.125 --> 09:25.458
Who's in there then?

09:25.541 --> 09:26.541
Prentice.

09:27.166 --> 09:30.625
Wicks' grandfather,
the founder of this church.

09:31.500 --> 09:33.000
Was like a father to me.

09:33.666 --> 09:35.666
Makes me sick.

09:35.750 --> 09:40.000
These kids painting rocket ships
all over his sacred resting place.

09:46.708 --> 09:49.416
-What are you doing?
-Oh, uh…

09:50.208 --> 09:52.125
Well, I do a little wood-working,

09:52.208 --> 09:55.708
so thought I could borrow
some of Sam's tools, make a proper--

09:55.791 --> 09:57.000
No, we leave that.

09:57.083 --> 09:59.958
A reminder of the shameful sin
of the harlot whore.

10:01.500 --> 10:02.916
Take my confession.

10:04.875 --> 10:06.625
Yes, the harlot whore.

10:08.125 --> 10:09.625
That was Wicks' mother.

10:09.708 --> 10:12.333
Okay, so what's the deal with that?

10:12.416 --> 10:14.625
She was a harlot and a whore.

10:15.458 --> 10:16.291
Okay.

10:16.375 --> 10:19.583
When Prentice entered the priesthood
and founded this church,

10:19.666 --> 10:21.833
he was widowed with a daughter.

10:22.958 --> 10:24.541
Grace was her name.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.750
Always a bad seed.

10:26.833 --> 10:32.166
She loved revealing clothes
and her fancy brands.

10:32.250 --> 10:33.875
Fancy brands… Oof.

10:33.958 --> 10:35.041
-Mm.
-Yeah.

10:35.125 --> 10:37.958
As a teenager, she slutted around bars,

10:38.041 --> 10:40.250
was soon pregnant by a drifter.

10:41.250 --> 10:45.291
Prentice had
a vast family fortune in the bank.

10:45.375 --> 10:48.416
To protect his grandson, Wicks,

10:48.500 --> 10:53.083
he promised that
if Grace stayed under his roof,

10:53.791 --> 10:56.916
the fortune would be willed to her.

10:57.916 --> 11:01.750
And so the whore
waited for her father to die.

11:02.666 --> 11:05.083
Oh, it weighed on him heavily.

11:05.166 --> 11:06.666
Martha, remember this.

11:07.833 --> 11:10.666
Wealth and the power that comes with it,

11:11.416 --> 11:12.666
is Eve's Apple.

11:13.916 --> 11:16.041
Temptation that leads to the fall.

11:17.291 --> 11:21.125
I must protect our loved ones
from its corrupting influence,

11:22.208 --> 11:23.625
at all costs.

11:24.375 --> 11:26.208
His day came at last.

11:26.291 --> 11:27.541
I was there.

11:28.625 --> 11:31.833
I saw Prentice take his final communion

11:31.916 --> 11:34.666
and die on the holy altar.

11:34.750 --> 11:36.166
At peace.

11:36.958 --> 11:40.458
The harlot whore
went straight to Prentice's attorney.

11:41.041 --> 11:44.125
"Give me my money," she said.

11:45.375 --> 11:46.833
And do you know what he said?

11:47.958 --> 11:52.458
"Yes, you are heir
to every single penny Prentice had."

11:53.250 --> 11:54.875
And in his accounts,

11:56.166 --> 11:59.166
not one hot dime.

11:59.875 --> 12:02.041
Mm, what did he do with the fortune?

12:02.125 --> 12:04.041
Gave it to the poor, say some.

12:04.666 --> 12:07.541
Threw it in the ocean, say others.
No one knows.

12:08.416 --> 12:09.416
It was gone.

12:10.375 --> 12:14.208
That holy man's final act of grace

12:15.333 --> 12:19.625
was to keep the corrupting evil
out of wicked hands.

12:20.666 --> 12:22.500
All that he left her…

12:25.541 --> 12:26.541
was this.

12:27.166 --> 12:29.208
"What is this?" she said.

12:30.291 --> 12:31.708
But I knew.

12:32.416 --> 12:34.250
Look not for Eve's Apple.

12:34.916 --> 12:38.333
Your inheritance is now Christ.

12:44.208 --> 12:46.833
That night, she had her revenge.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
In a demonic rage,

12:52.083 --> 12:56.166
she defiled this holy place.

13:11.416 --> 13:13.833
Blasphemy, desecration.

13:15.416 --> 13:18.416
Evil incarnate.

13:54.083 --> 13:56.458
I said, "Sister Grace,

13:56.541 --> 14:01.458
God, your Father,
will forgive you in His love."

14:18.041 --> 14:19.541
She died,

14:20.083 --> 14:22.375
throwing herself against Prentice's tomb.

14:25.541 --> 14:27.541
Brain aneurysm, they said.

14:28.750 --> 14:30.666
Struck down, I say,

14:31.541 --> 14:34.875
by God in His mercy.

14:35.958 --> 14:37.500
Holy shit.

14:39.666 --> 14:40.666
Sorry, sorry.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.333
The darkness of that story
was the bedrock of this place.

14:46.416 --> 14:48.666
You could feel it.

14:48.750 --> 14:50.083
And he asked, "Who told you…"

14:50.166 --> 14:54.500
So what would draw someone
to make this their spiritual home?

14:55.083 --> 14:58.083
The core group of regulars
all had their reasons.

14:58.166 --> 15:00.125
And these will be our suspects.

15:00.208 --> 15:01.833
So I should introduce them.

15:02.500 --> 15:06.208
Vera Draven, local attorney.
She was loyal and devoted.

15:08.625 --> 15:11.958
My dad was
Wicks' attorney and drinking buddy.

15:12.041 --> 15:14.166
The boys.

15:14.250 --> 15:18.625
And so you became a lawyer so you could
take over his family practice?

15:18.708 --> 15:21.791
I became a lawyer because
I wanted to do great things in the world.

15:23.125 --> 15:25.958
But this place is my dad's legacy.

15:26.708 --> 15:27.750
And he wanted me to…

15:27.833 --> 15:30.208
-Thank you.
-…keep it going after he passed.

15:30.291 --> 15:32.708
So here I am.

15:32.791 --> 15:34.625
Yo, yo. Hey, Vera.

15:34.708 --> 15:37.041
-Hi. Oh. Thank you.
-Would you fill this up?

15:37.125 --> 15:39.625
Her adopted son, Cy, just moved back home

15:39.708 --> 15:42.416
after trying and failing
to get a foothold in politics.

15:42.500 --> 15:43.416
Hi.

15:43.500 --> 15:44.458
Hey.

15:44.541 --> 15:45.625
Okay.

15:46.666 --> 15:48.208
It's nice having him back?

15:51.416 --> 15:54.416
When Vera was young,
just out of law school,

15:54.500 --> 15:58.250
her dad came home
with ten-year-old Cy, out of the blue,

15:58.333 --> 16:00.666
and told Vera she was gonna raise him.

16:00.750 --> 16:02.166
No questions asked.

16:03.750 --> 16:07.416
The whole town knew he was
obviously her illegitimate brother.

16:08.083 --> 16:09.500
But Vera accepted it.

16:10.458 --> 16:11.750
She did it.

16:11.833 --> 16:14.416
I've given up a lot to…

16:14.500 --> 16:19.041
…be loyal to my dad
and to Cy and to Wicks.

16:20.375 --> 16:21.708
So I think that

16:21.791 --> 16:25.208
when my dad
is looking down on me from heaven,

16:25.291 --> 16:28.708
I think he is very…

16:28.791 --> 16:30.500
…pleased with me.

16:32.875 --> 16:34.291
So I guess that's nice.

16:34.958 --> 16:36.041
I came this close.

16:36.125 --> 16:38.666
I was the GOP golden boy, the great hope.

16:38.750 --> 16:41.291
I've got connections and ins and outs.

16:41.375 --> 16:43.500
I was on the cusp,
but I just couldn't engage voters.

16:43.583 --> 16:47.500
I didn't… have that
cult of personality thing, I guess.

16:47.583 --> 16:50.416
It's hard connecting with people
in a genuine way.

16:50.500 --> 16:52.208
-I know.
-Mm-hmm.

16:52.291 --> 16:54.708
I tried everything. Believe me,
I hammered the race thing.

16:54.791 --> 16:57.000
I hammered the gender thing,
the trans thing,

16:57.083 --> 16:59.208
the border thing, the homeless thing,

16:59.291 --> 17:03.125
the war thing, the election thing,
the abortion thing, the climate thing.

17:03.916 --> 17:07.916
Thing about induction stoves,
Israel, library books, vaccines,

17:08.000 --> 17:11.083
pronouns, AK-47s, socialism, BLM,

17:11.166 --> 17:15.000
CRT, the CDC, DEI, 5G, everything.

17:15.708 --> 17:19.708
All of it I did. Nobody, just nothing.

17:20.458 --> 17:22.666
People are just numb these days.
I don't know why.

17:22.750 --> 17:25.625
Maybe we need to get back
to fundamentals, you know,

17:25.708 --> 17:29.166
basic building blocks
on how to genuinely inspire people.

17:29.250 --> 17:31.291
The basics,
like, show them something they hate

17:31.375 --> 17:34.041
and then make them afraid it's gonna
take away something they love?

17:35.833 --> 17:37.125
Well, no.

17:37.208 --> 17:38.541
Vera.

17:38.625 --> 17:41.333
Nat Sharp, the town's local doctor.

17:41.416 --> 17:43.625
His life revolved around his wife, Darla.

17:44.291 --> 17:45.958
She was his everything.

17:46.041 --> 17:47.875
Darla left me last week.

17:47.958 --> 17:49.625
Oh, I'm sorry.

17:50.125 --> 17:53.000
Took the kids, moved to Tucson

17:54.166 --> 17:56.791
with some guy that she met
on a Phish message board.

18:00.416 --> 18:01.625
Phish the band?

18:01.708 --> 18:03.125
I had no idea.

18:03.958 --> 18:06.875
Dr. Nat was spinning out.

18:06.958 --> 18:10.791
He wasn't successful enough,
rich enough, good enough for her.

18:10.875 --> 18:13.000
He would do anything to get her back.

18:17.208 --> 18:19.833
The closest thing we have
to a local celebrity,

18:19.916 --> 18:22.041
the sci-fi writer Lee Ross.

18:23.125 --> 18:25.041
You probably know
at least some of his books.

18:25.666 --> 18:28.083
The Crescent Limbo series,
Ice Pick of Time,

18:28.166 --> 18:29.500
The Crystaline Juncture.

18:30.291 --> 18:32.791
Ten years ago,
Lee moved here from New York,

18:32.875 --> 18:35.875
connected with Wicks and the church,
and as he puts it…

18:35.958 --> 18:37.458
Unplugged my brain, you know,

18:37.541 --> 18:41.958
from the… liberal hive mind
and… come here and…

18:42.875 --> 18:46.833
His book sales and popular standing
have been in slow decline ever since.

18:47.958 --> 18:51.375
But he'd spent the last year
writing a massive book about Wicks.

18:51.458 --> 18:52.958
His teachings, my reflections,

18:53.041 --> 18:56.458
essays and recollections
of an acolyte at the feet of a prophet.

18:56.541 --> 18:58.708
The Holy Man and the Troubadour.

18:58.791 --> 19:02.416
I found it a tough read,
but he pinned all of his hopes on it.

19:02.500 --> 19:05.875
This is my last chance ticket
out of Substack hell.

19:05.958 --> 19:08.625
I can't take it anymore.
My readers these days…

19:09.125 --> 19:11.541
I mean, they are survivalist freaks.

19:11.625 --> 19:14.250
They all look like John Goodman
in The Big Lebowski.

19:18.208 --> 19:21.291
This little shitwick, Cy.

19:22.041 --> 19:25.250
He's got his little influencer fangs
in the Monsignor lately.

19:25.333 --> 19:28.000
We don't like him. We're all like,
"Wicks. Be careful,

19:28.083 --> 19:32.166
you gotta shake him off.
He's bad news. Opportunistic poetaster."

19:33.166 --> 19:36.791
We're gonna have to protect Wicks
from these leeching millennials.

19:36.875 --> 19:39.666
Simone was new to town,
and new to the church.

19:39.750 --> 19:43.291
She'd been a world-class cellist.

19:46.500 --> 19:49.583
Forced to retire five years ago
for health reasons.

19:49.666 --> 19:52.500
Chronic pain. Some mysterious nerve thing

19:52.583 --> 19:54.833
-that doctors cannot diagnose.
-Sorry.

19:54.916 --> 19:57.083
I believed they could heal me.

19:57.166 --> 19:58.791
Suckered.

19:59.291 --> 20:00.708
Dipshit moi.

20:02.250 --> 20:04.500
I mean, to take someone's faith

20:04.583 --> 20:06.208
and exploit it for money

20:08.083 --> 20:09.500
is the ultimate evil.

20:11.750 --> 20:13.166
Don't you think it is?

20:13.250 --> 20:15.375
Yeah. Yeah, it's bad.

20:16.791 --> 20:18.916
But I understand wanting to believe.

20:20.958 --> 20:22.583
This feels different, though.

20:24.416 --> 20:26.833
Faith in God to heal me.

20:29.041 --> 20:30.250
This is different.

20:33.625 --> 20:36.250
I feel hopeful now.

20:38.125 --> 20:40.416
Like a miracle could happen.

20:43.500 --> 20:45.916
That's how Monsignor Wicks makes me feel.

20:56.791 --> 20:59.708
The Spirit really moved him today, huh?

21:00.958 --> 21:02.166
Monsignor!

21:03.083 --> 21:04.333
Ah, my warrior.

21:04.916 --> 21:08.000
Wicks kept his core group tight.

21:08.083 --> 21:11.583
And the seductive power
of his charisma was undeniable.

21:13.666 --> 21:14.875
But his method…

21:15.875 --> 21:17.916
Every week, he would pick someone out,

21:18.000 --> 21:20.958
a newcomer usually, and he would attack.

21:21.041 --> 21:24.125
The world wants us all to be okay.

21:25.958 --> 21:29.791
Any of your choices.
Make your choices. They're your choices.

21:30.291 --> 21:31.500
Don't feel bad.

21:32.208 --> 21:33.500
Have that affair.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.208
Tell that lie.

21:35.291 --> 21:37.625
Have that child out of wedlock.

21:37.708 --> 21:40.500
Satisfy your selfish heart.

21:41.125 --> 21:42.541
Selfish.

21:42.625 --> 21:43.666
Yes.

21:44.208 --> 21:47.333
Depriving that child of a family.

21:48.250 --> 21:49.583
Of a father.

21:50.083 --> 21:52.291
An assault on our castle.

21:52.375 --> 21:54.375
The institution of manhood.

21:54.458 --> 21:56.916
My own mother made
that selfish choice with me.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.125
And I curse her selfish heart for it.

21:59.208 --> 22:01.625
Every day of my life.

22:01.708 --> 22:05.875
Putting her needs and wants
before the family God intended.

22:05.958 --> 22:07.166
I am enough!

22:07.750 --> 22:10.416
Me!

22:10.500 --> 22:14.416
Selfish, harlot heart, you are not.

22:15.208 --> 22:16.708
Might as well beat that child.

22:16.791 --> 22:19.458
Yes, might as well starve that child.

22:19.541 --> 22:22.375
Defy the family that the Lord intended.

22:22.458 --> 22:26.291
And watch your child
burn beneath that burden.

22:29.208 --> 22:31.333
This is not the true church.

22:32.291 --> 22:35.375
You ask even the most hardcore
of those in the pews,

22:35.458 --> 22:38.125
they'll say, no,
of course this is not what they believe.

22:38.208 --> 22:40.958
It's Wicks being Wicks,
pushing it too far.

22:41.041 --> 22:44.958
And what he's pushing for
every time is a walkout.

22:46.458 --> 22:47.875
Why does he do this?

22:48.458 --> 22:51.458
Because when that person walks out,
everyone watches.

22:52.041 --> 22:54.791
And even if in the light of day
it's indefensible,

22:54.875 --> 22:58.041
deep down in the dark,
it scratches an itch.

23:02.250 --> 23:05.666
And by staying put in that pew,
a side is taken.

23:06.916 --> 23:08.625
Wicks' side.

23:08.708 --> 23:11.708
Testing tolerances,
tapping deep poisoned wells,

23:11.791 --> 23:13.791
hardening, binding with complicity.

23:13.875 --> 23:17.333
…for a two-run homer
and that brings the Cubs…

23:17.416 --> 23:18.916
Mm.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.583
So I try to offer a counterbalance.

23:22.666 --> 23:26.041
Okay, welcome to our first
Father Jud prayer group.

23:26.125 --> 23:28.583
Um, thank you all for being here.

23:29.250 --> 23:32.041
And this is all about breaking down walls

23:32.125 --> 23:34.541
between us and Christ,

23:35.250 --> 23:38.083
us and each other, us and the world.

23:39.333 --> 23:40.958
When I was 17,

23:41.458 --> 23:43.000
I was a boxer

23:43.083 --> 23:45.583
and I… I… killed a man in the ring.

23:47.458 --> 23:49.375
I built up so many walls of…

23:50.041 --> 23:52.833
of anger, addiction, violence.

23:54.333 --> 23:56.541
It was only when I felt safe enough to…

23:57.125 --> 24:00.958
to put my dukes down, open my arms,

24:01.041 --> 24:03.125
um, confess my deepest sin.

24:03.791 --> 24:06.208
That was the day
that Christ saved my life.

24:06.958 --> 24:09.583
It… He didn't… He didn't transform me.

24:09.666 --> 24:12.375
He sustains me every day.

24:13.958 --> 24:15.458
That's daily bread, right?

24:16.958 --> 24:19.083
I think that's what the church should be.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.416
That's what I want
this church to be, for me

24:23.083 --> 24:24.500
and for all of you.

24:29.166 --> 24:30.458
So…

24:33.625 --> 24:36.041
Monsignor Wicks isn't coming?

24:38.041 --> 24:39.666
No, but…

24:40.458 --> 24:41.458
No.

24:41.541 --> 24:44.625
So, I thought we could just talk
and start sharing and--

24:44.708 --> 24:46.333
But he knows that we're doing these?

24:46.416 --> 24:48.583
Sure, of course. Of course, I'll tell him.

24:48.666 --> 24:50.833
I just… I wanted us to connect and, uh…

24:50.916 --> 24:53.125
You'll tell him? You'll… You'll tell him?

24:53.208 --> 24:56.625
Contraction of the simple future tense
meaning you haven't yet

24:57.250 --> 24:58.458
told him?

24:59.416 --> 25:00.833
Why wouldn't you tell him?

25:00.916 --> 25:02.875
-This feels kind of weird.
-Okay, guys.

25:03.458 --> 25:06.541
This is a prayer meeting.
It's… it's not a secret or anything.

25:06.625 --> 25:08.791
-Well, it's a secret prayer meeting.
-No.

25:08.875 --> 25:10.583
That's literally what it is.

25:10.666 --> 25:11.833
I just texted the Monsignor.

25:11.916 --> 25:14.333
Great, so… it isn't a secret anymore.

25:14.416 --> 25:17.625
Now, if we could get back to breaking
down those walls through Christ's love--

25:18.750 --> 25:21.166
-He says, "What the holy heck?"
-Oh.

25:21.250 --> 25:23.458
-Jeez.
-I'm… I'm sorry. Father,

25:23.541 --> 25:27.541
I came because I thought
this was an official church function.

25:27.625 --> 25:29.833
Only he didn't use the word "heck".

25:29.916 --> 25:31.458
Okay, thank you, Martha.

25:31.541 --> 25:32.875
This is a church function, Vera.

25:32.958 --> 25:34.791
It's at a church.
It's with me. It's official.

25:34.875 --> 25:36.166
-Um…
-Or "holy".

25:36.250 --> 25:38.458
-Show… Can I see that?
-I think I should go.

25:38.541 --> 25:39.541
-Okay.
-Bye.

25:39.625 --> 25:41.500
-Thank you. Uh, Cyrus?
-Yeah.

25:41.583 --> 25:42.458
Oh, wow.

25:42.541 --> 25:44.875
Yeah, sorry, Father.
I don't want to piss him off.

25:45.583 --> 25:47.083
Nice try, guy.

25:47.166 --> 25:48.125
Thanks, Doc.

25:48.208 --> 25:50.625
I'm probably gonna post this tomorrow.
Can I tag you?

25:50.708 --> 25:51.875
I'd prefer you didn't.

25:51.958 --> 25:53.041
I probably will anyway.

25:53.125 --> 25:54.166
I know.

25:56.625 --> 26:00.375
I'm so sorry your little coup failed
this afternoon, Father.

26:00.458 --> 26:02.041
My coup? Martha, really?

26:02.125 --> 26:05.541
If we want to pray
or need to confess something,

26:05.625 --> 26:08.000
we can do it with Monsignor Wicks.

26:08.083 --> 26:10.916
Can you? 'Cause you all seem
scared to death of the guy.

26:11.000 --> 26:14.000
Could you walk into that church
of your own free will

26:14.083 --> 26:17.291
and confess your deepest sin to Wicks,
Martha, without fear?

26:17.375 --> 26:20.750
'Cause… 'cause if not,
this whole place is a whitewashed tomb.

26:20.833 --> 26:23.250
Yes, I could.

26:23.333 --> 26:24.416
Well,

26:25.625 --> 26:27.041
good!

26:59.583 --> 27:03.416
Holy Week, the week
of special services leading up to Easter.

27:04.375 --> 27:07.208
It was on Palm Sunday
that I finally broke.

27:07.291 --> 27:10.500
And then, uh…
twice in the shower this week

27:11.333 --> 27:14.791
doing that thing I told you about
where I hold my hand upside down?

27:16.041 --> 27:18.458
Five Our Fathers, five Hail Marys.

27:19.791 --> 27:22.250
Well, we're at nine months now, Jud.

27:23.791 --> 27:28.583
How are you enjoying it here?
Are you breaking down some… walls?

27:32.250 --> 27:36.125
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
It's been a week since my last confession.

27:40.208 --> 27:42.833
I betrayed a fellow priest's privacy.

27:44.041 --> 27:47.458
I know that Martha keeps
her medical bills filed in the office, so…

27:48.416 --> 27:49.625
I went through them.

27:50.666 --> 27:53.375
And I learned you had
a radical prostatectomy five years ago,

27:53.458 --> 27:56.708
making you physically incapable
of an erection.

27:59.166 --> 28:01.583
I can handle whatever this is.

28:02.125 --> 28:05.708
For the past nine months,
I've seen the way you tend this flock,

28:05.791 --> 28:07.125
and I don't like it.

28:07.208 --> 28:08.291
You don't like it?

28:08.375 --> 28:10.208
No, Monsignor, I don't.

28:10.291 --> 28:11.500
Nat Sharp.

28:11.583 --> 28:14.791
Man needs to forgive
and start living his life.

28:14.875 --> 28:17.791
And Christ's love should be
a launching pad for that, and instead,

28:17.875 --> 28:19.583
he's just, every day,

28:19.666 --> 28:22.875
getting more and more angry
and bitter against his ex-wife,

28:22.958 --> 28:23.958
against women.

28:24.916 --> 28:28.250
It's bad. And Lee, he's a storyteller.

28:28.333 --> 28:31.833
And it's like his superpower
has been turned against him.

28:31.916 --> 28:34.791
The only story he tells is,
"The world is out to get me."

28:34.875 --> 28:38.125
He was brilliant funny,
and smart and respected,

28:38.208 --> 28:43.791
and now he's just spinning out
and angry all the time, paranoid.

28:43.875 --> 28:46.916
Did you know he literally
built a moat around his house?

28:47.500 --> 28:48.333
Really?

28:49.500 --> 28:52.333
I mean, it's mostly symbolic, but yeah.

28:53.125 --> 28:55.125
And Simone, I'm sorry, Monsignor,

28:55.208 --> 28:57.416
but I'm afraid
you've taken advantage of her.

28:57.500 --> 28:59.333
I've seen the donation numbers.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.125
I know how much she's giving,
and the past few months,

29:02.208 --> 29:03.916
she's basically supporting this place.

29:04.000 --> 29:07.708
And yes, I believe in the possibility
of miracles through Christ,

29:07.791 --> 29:09.791
but what you're giving her is not that.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.208
It's transactional, through you,

29:13.291 --> 29:15.625
and God help you,
it makes her feel betrayed again.

29:16.208 --> 29:17.875
God help me. Anything else?

29:17.958 --> 29:20.208
Yeah, why not? Cy Draven.

29:20.291 --> 29:23.666
Doesn't this new YouTube stuff
he's doing worry you?

29:23.750 --> 29:26.166
Every week now, he takes clips
from what you say in Mass

29:26.250 --> 29:30.750
and plugs them into his political rants.
He's co-opting, and honestly,

29:30.833 --> 29:33.416
I think misrepresenting the church
in a dangerous way.

29:34.666 --> 29:38.333
When was the last time
a new person lasted more than one Sunday?

29:38.958 --> 29:40.333
Word's gotten out.

29:40.916 --> 29:42.916
Every week now, it's just this…

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
this hardened cyst of regulars,

29:45.083 --> 29:49.375
and it seems like you're intentionally
keeping them angry and afraid.

29:50.333 --> 29:52.041
Is that how Christ led his flock?

29:52.125 --> 29:54.250
Is that what we're supposed to do?

30:02.791 --> 30:06.458
Right now, you're angry. You should be.

30:06.541 --> 30:08.875
It'd be dangerous if you weren't.
I'd see you're helpless,

30:08.958 --> 30:11.000
and I'd do it again and again.

30:11.791 --> 30:14.166
I'm the world. You're the church.

30:14.250 --> 30:17.125
Stay there. Stay there. Stay.

30:18.500 --> 30:21.958
Aha. Good. Right. Yes.

30:22.541 --> 30:26.625
Anger. Anger lets us fight back,
take back the ground we've lost.

30:27.208 --> 30:29.375
And we've lost so much ground.

30:29.958 --> 30:31.083
And now you're afraid.

30:31.166 --> 30:34.041
Look at those bare-knuckle instincts
coming back. Good!

30:34.875 --> 30:37.333
You're afraid I'm gonna come at you again.

30:37.416 --> 30:40.750
But you're protecting yourself.

30:43.125 --> 30:46.541
Because the world wants to destroy us.

30:47.500 --> 30:51.333
Your version of love
and forgiveness is a sop.

30:51.416 --> 30:54.416
It's going along
to get along with modernity,

30:54.500 --> 30:56.708
not wanting to offend this garbage world.

30:56.791 --> 31:00.041
Meanwhile, they destroy us.

31:00.708 --> 31:05.125
Feminist Marxist whores.
Bit by bit, they do.

31:07.208 --> 31:10.416
But I carry my burden. I hold the line.

31:12.458 --> 31:13.541
And you?

31:14.750 --> 31:17.166
You simpering child from Albany?

31:19.666 --> 31:21.291
Are you gonna get angry

31:22.375 --> 31:23.750
and fight?

31:32.083 --> 31:34.083
You're poisoning this church.

31:35.250 --> 31:37.666
And I'll do whatever it takes to save it.

31:39.458 --> 31:41.291
To cut you out like a cancer.

31:44.500 --> 31:46.916
Five Our Fathers, five Hail Marys.

32:07.583 --> 32:09.583
Christ, you didn't give up on me.

32:10.166 --> 32:12.416
I'm not giving up on this church.

32:14.916 --> 32:16.833
But he was one step ahead of me.

32:17.666 --> 32:20.083
Father Jud's prayer meeting?

32:20.791 --> 32:22.291
I have kept this church.

32:22.375 --> 32:24.083
I have fortified it with the truth of God.

32:24.166 --> 32:27.458
And now the betrayal to find my authority

32:27.541 --> 32:30.666
and faith and life itself challenged,

32:30.750 --> 32:32.833
and from inside my own sanctuary.

32:35.333 --> 32:36.416
Get out!

32:40.166 --> 32:41.791
Wicks' final move.

32:41.875 --> 32:43.708
Open war against me.

32:46.500 --> 32:48.166
I got pretty toasty.

32:48.750 --> 32:51.583
The world's a wolf. You devil.

32:51.666 --> 32:53.291
You devil wolf.

32:53.791 --> 32:55.208
You're a devil wolf.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.208
Shit.

32:57.708 --> 33:01.250
-Oh! Nikolai, I'm sorry. I broke that…
-No, no, no. Don't worry about it.

33:01.333 --> 33:03.750
-…with my hand.
-They're junk lamps. They're junk lamps.

33:03.833 --> 33:05.583
-Come on. Hey, are you good to drive?
-Yeah.

33:05.666 --> 33:06.500
Are you sure?

33:22.708 --> 33:23.833
Hey!

33:26.625 --> 33:27.833
Who's there?

33:27.916 --> 33:28.875
Oh, shit.

33:30.333 --> 33:32.458
And that brings us to Good Friday.

33:34.625 --> 33:36.000
Here we go.

33:36.083 --> 33:38.208
It was a 3:00 p.m. service.

33:39.125 --> 33:40.375
Just the regulars.

33:41.208 --> 33:43.000
There was a strange tension in the air.

33:43.708 --> 33:46.000
I can't recall the homily,
but it felt different.

33:47.500 --> 33:49.875
The anger felt less calculated.

33:50.875 --> 33:51.791
More unhinged.

33:57.708 --> 34:01.375
As always, after the homily,
Wicks was spent,

34:01.458 --> 34:04.666
emotionally and physically,
and needed some time to recover.

34:06.708 --> 34:09.041
He would duck into
the small storage closet

34:09.125 --> 34:12.000
just to the side of the sanctuary
so he'd be out of sight.

34:13.208 --> 34:16.291
He'd fortify himself,
and I would continue the service

34:16.375 --> 34:19.541
until he felt strong enough
to rejoin and take over.

34:19.625 --> 34:22.458
Behold the wood of the cross

34:22.541 --> 34:25.625
On which hung
The salvation of the world

34:34.458 --> 34:35.708
Monsignor?

34:50.166 --> 34:51.250
What's wrong?

34:53.083 --> 34:54.125
Jefferson?

35:16.583 --> 35:17.500
Jud.

35:20.625 --> 35:21.833
There's something in his back.

35:22.416 --> 35:23.583
Wait. Don't touch it.

35:24.500 --> 35:25.916
Don't… don't touch anything.

35:44.458 --> 35:46.583
Satan! Satan struck him down!

35:46.666 --> 35:48.166
-The devil… Satan…
-Martha.

35:48.250 --> 35:49.833
-…struck him down!
-Oh, no.

35:49.916 --> 35:52.708
Martha! Please.

36:29.500 --> 36:32.083
The ambulance took
just five minutes to arrive.

36:34.458 --> 36:36.583
Wicks was pronounced dead on the scene.

36:37.291 --> 36:40.916
When I joined the others outside,
the police were just arriving.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.833
The devil will not take that man.

36:43.916 --> 36:46.750
He will rise again
in the glory of the Lord.

36:47.750 --> 36:50.583
This was an insane event for a tiny town,

36:50.666 --> 36:54.666
and poor Geraldine, the local chief,
was thrown in headlong.

36:54.750 --> 36:56.166
Christ.

36:57.375 --> 37:00.583
Hours of questioning
all through the day Saturday

37:01.250 --> 37:03.958
-until finally…
-You're the only one on stage

37:04.041 --> 37:06.291
with the Monsignor
at the time of his killing.

37:07.041 --> 37:09.166
And you had prior possession
of the wolf-head figurine

37:09.250 --> 37:10.666
attached to the murder weapon.

37:12.500 --> 37:14.958
And you're the only one
at that church who hated his guts.

37:15.041 --> 37:16.875
I… I don't hate any guts.

37:16.958 --> 37:22.166
But it's literally impossible for anyone
to have done this, so I don't…

37:23.750 --> 37:26.833
Oh, I don't know what this is.

37:31.250 --> 37:34.250
All right. Father,
why don't you go get some rest?

37:34.333 --> 37:37.208
But I should warn you before
you walk out of here, the town is talking.

37:37.833 --> 37:40.333
Cy Draven put this up
on his YouTube this morning.

37:40.416 --> 37:42.541
…poisoning this church.

37:42.625 --> 37:44.750
And I'll do whatever it takes to save it.

37:45.291 --> 37:49.125
To cut you out like a cancer.

37:50.958 --> 37:53.333
It's been reposted.

37:54.833 --> 37:56.041
Quite a bit.

38:31.208 --> 38:35.625
I turned on my phone
for two minutes, and that was a mistake.

38:36.166 --> 38:39.666
A flood of messages to the killer priest.

38:41.875 --> 38:45.541
But I wasn't thinking about
getting arrested or defrocked.

38:46.083 --> 38:49.916
I was thinking Wicks had won.

38:51.125 --> 38:54.041
Because in the part of my soul
that cannot lie to Christ,

38:54.125 --> 38:56.958
or myself, or you…

39:00.333 --> 39:03.416
…I was happy the old man was dead.

39:11.791 --> 39:12.875
Jesus.

39:13.708 --> 39:16.291
Help me.

39:17.333 --> 39:19.750
Show me the way through this, please.

39:24.166 --> 39:25.666
Hello?

39:29.416 --> 39:31.041
Oh, I'm sorry. Um…

39:32.500 --> 39:33.916
Are you open?

39:35.041 --> 39:36.125
Always.

39:36.708 --> 39:37.916
You all right?

39:39.000 --> 39:41.500
Yeah. Uh-huh. Sorry.

39:42.875 --> 39:47.791
-Uh, there's no Easter Mass. I'm sorry.
-Oh, I'm…

39:47.875 --> 39:51.541
-You're welcome. Come in. Come in.
-Thank you. Thank you.

39:51.625 --> 39:56.041
I don't want to take you away
from your priestly duties now, do I?

39:58.416 --> 40:01.166
Well… Isn't this something?

40:01.250 --> 40:02.083
Right?

40:02.166 --> 40:06.375
It's… hard to be in here
and not feel His presence.

40:07.000 --> 40:08.083
Whose?

40:09.041 --> 40:12.083
Oh. God… Oh. Yeah.

40:12.166 --> 40:13.750
-Yeah.
-You're not a Catholic.

40:13.833 --> 40:16.000
No, very much not, no.

40:16.875 --> 40:18.291
Proud heretic.

40:19.250 --> 40:21.458
I kneel at the altar of the rational.

40:21.541 --> 40:24.500
Uh-huh. You weren't raised in the faith?

40:25.250 --> 40:27.958
My mother is… was, uh,

40:28.041 --> 40:30.875
very, very religious, you know.

40:32.583 --> 40:34.416
-Were you close with her?
-No.

40:35.250 --> 40:39.125
When I was a boy, we, um… But it's…

40:39.208 --> 40:41.208
-Complicated. Family.
-It's complicated.

40:41.291 --> 40:42.708
Yeah. That's right.

40:47.791 --> 40:49.500
How does all this make you feel?

40:52.791 --> 40:54.625
How does it make me feel?

40:59.208 --> 41:00.041
Truthfully?

41:00.125 --> 41:01.208
Sure.

41:03.541 --> 41:05.375
Well, the architecture, that interests me.

41:06.375 --> 41:09.583
I feel the grandeur, the… the mystery,

41:09.666 --> 41:13.375
the intended emotional effect. It's…

41:15.750 --> 41:20.958
And it's like someone has shone
a story at me that I do not believe.

41:21.833 --> 41:25.500
It's built upon the empty promise
of a child's fairy tale

41:25.583 --> 41:30.250
filled with malevolence
and misogyny and homophobia

41:30.333 --> 41:34.500
and its justified
untold acts of violence and cruelty

41:34.583 --> 41:36.583
while all the while, and still,

41:36.666 --> 41:39.500
hiding its own shameful acts.

41:39.583 --> 41:41.708
So like an ornery mule kicking back,

41:41.791 --> 41:45.000
I want to pick it apart
and pop its perfidious bubble of belief

41:45.083 --> 41:50.291
and get to a truth
I can swallow without choking.

41:57.708 --> 42:02.833
The rafter details
are very fine, though. It's…

42:04.500 --> 42:07.333
Listen… you want to kick me out,
you go right ahead.

42:07.416 --> 42:08.500
No, no.

42:09.958 --> 42:11.625
You're being honest, it's good.

42:11.708 --> 42:15.166
Telling the truth can be a belly rub.

42:15.250 --> 42:19.000
Now, I suspect you can't always
be honest with your parishioners.

42:19.083 --> 42:22.250
You can always be honest
by not saying the unhonest part.

42:23.000 --> 42:24.875
Yeah.

42:26.125 --> 42:28.125
You're right. It's storytelling.

42:29.416 --> 42:32.958
And this church, it's… it's not medieval.
We're in New York.

42:33.708 --> 42:35.833
It's neo-Gothic 19th century.

42:35.916 --> 42:38.458
It has more in common
with Disneyland than Notre-Dame…

42:38.541 --> 42:40.750
…and the rites and rituals

42:42.000 --> 42:43.625
and costumes, all of it.

42:44.458 --> 42:45.875
It's storytelling.

42:47.333 --> 42:48.416
You're right.

42:51.291 --> 42:52.916
I guess the question is

42:54.625 --> 42:56.750
do these stories convince us of a lie?

42:58.625 --> 43:02.708
Or do they resonate with something
deep inside us that's profoundly true?

43:05.458 --> 43:08.125
That we can't express any other way…

43:10.416 --> 43:11.833
except storytelling.

43:15.125 --> 43:17.333
Touché. Padre.

43:25.833 --> 43:27.250
-Son.
-I'm sorry.

43:28.416 --> 43:29.625
I just…

43:30.875 --> 43:33.291
I just felt like a priest again,

43:33.916 --> 43:36.041
and now I'm gonna lose that and…

43:37.000 --> 43:39.541
and lose my purpose and I'm frightened, I…

43:39.625 --> 43:42.125
I don't know how I'll live.

43:42.208 --> 43:43.291
Blanc!

43:44.041 --> 43:46.666
Hey! You found him! Is he…

43:55.208 --> 43:56.208
Who are you?

43:56.291 --> 43:57.916
I probably should have led with this.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.083
My name is Benoit Blanc. I'm a detective.

44:00.166 --> 44:03.583
I've taken an interest
in the murder of Jefferson Wicks.

44:04.958 --> 44:06.791
You're a detective,
so you're with the police?

44:06.875 --> 44:09.083
No, no. I work in a private capacity.

44:09.166 --> 44:12.250
Everyone thinks I did it. I didn't do it.

44:12.833 --> 44:14.875
But in my heart maybe I did,

44:14.958 --> 44:17.458
and the way it happened
was some kind of miracle.

44:17.541 --> 44:18.541
And…

44:19.041 --> 44:21.541
I don't know. I'm lost. I don't know.

44:22.708 --> 44:24.708
Would you allow me to help you?

44:27.041 --> 44:28.125
What?

44:28.208 --> 44:30.958
Your lips are cracked with dehydration.

44:31.041 --> 44:32.458
You haven't slept all night.

44:33.041 --> 44:34.416
You spent it out of doors,

44:34.500 --> 44:37.333
by the state of your pant legs,
on your knees in prayer.

44:38.083 --> 44:41.500
What I see is not a guilty man in torment,

44:42.250 --> 44:45.458
but an innocent man tormented by guilt.

44:47.083 --> 44:48.291
Let me help you.

44:48.833 --> 44:49.708
How?

44:49.791 --> 44:51.708
This was dressed as a miracle.

44:52.208 --> 44:55.625
It's just a murder and I solve murders.

44:57.500 --> 44:59.666
Wait… Were you

45:00.500 --> 45:03.666
the Kentucky Derby thing with the murder
and the guy that they caught

45:03.750 --> 45:05.250
-with the photo-finish camera?
-Yeah.

45:05.333 --> 45:06.416
So you're…

45:07.250 --> 45:08.458
You were on The View.

45:08.541 --> 45:10.166
-Yeah.
-What are you doing here?

45:10.250 --> 45:14.000
I need to come up to speed rapidly
on the events of that Good Friday service

45:14.083 --> 45:17.041
and the goings-on here
at Our Lady of Perpetual Fortitude.

45:17.708 --> 45:20.583
Geraldine has graciously
allowed me access.

45:20.666 --> 45:24.750
If you can spare the day
and accompany me on my investigation,

45:25.375 --> 45:28.541
view the body, trace the murder weapon,
inspect the crime scene,

45:28.625 --> 45:32.125
you are in a unique position to assist me.

45:33.791 --> 45:35.000
The body?

45:40.916 --> 45:43.625
Yeah, I've changed my mind.
I don't think I should be here.

45:44.708 --> 45:47.333
Blanc, I'm trusting your process,
but I agree with him.

45:47.416 --> 45:51.500
No, no, no. I want you to get a clear
clinical picture of what happened here.

45:51.583 --> 45:55.666
To see Wicks as he is, a corpse.
Just an empty vessel.

45:55.750 --> 45:59.208
Not the mythologized monster in your mind,
but merely flesh and blood.

45:59.291 --> 46:01.708
Dead from a knife wound we can analyze.

46:01.791 --> 46:04.541
Just… flesh and blood.

46:05.208 --> 46:06.500
Flesh and blood, yeah.

46:06.583 --> 46:09.250
Yes, that's our wiggly wiggly.

46:09.833 --> 46:12.041
-Yeah. Look at that.
-Please stop doing that.

46:13.125 --> 46:15.791
-Tammy. Would you mind flipping the meat?
-Mm.

46:15.875 --> 46:17.416
-Pancake him. Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

46:21.958 --> 46:23.583
One, two, three.

46:29.500 --> 46:32.625
-Hey! Hey.
-No, no, no. I don't belong here.

46:32.708 --> 46:35.083
I can't be in here,
I don't know why you brought me.

46:35.166 --> 46:36.208
-I can't--
-Hey!

46:37.416 --> 46:38.833
If you want absolution,

46:38.916 --> 46:42.375
you want ever to be a priest again,
then you need to go through this with me.

46:42.458 --> 46:46.125
The real killer is out there.
We've got to find him, nail him, I…

46:46.208 --> 46:47.041
I'm sorry.

46:47.125 --> 46:50.041
I mean, catch him and get your life back.

46:50.125 --> 46:51.333
Father.

46:52.083 --> 46:54.416
I need to know
you understand the situation.

46:54.500 --> 46:57.833
We are not all buddies
running around trying to solve a case.

46:57.916 --> 46:59.541
You are still a suspect.

46:59.625 --> 47:03.708
The point is, you do not need to be here
without a lawyer, do you understand that?

47:05.583 --> 47:08.333
I didn't do this.

47:09.583 --> 47:11.250
If I can help find out who did,

47:11.916 --> 47:14.458
then I'm in, yeah, let's do it, yeah.

47:14.541 --> 47:15.750
Okay.

47:16.625 --> 47:17.833
The body.

47:17.916 --> 47:19.500
Next the murder weapon.

47:19.583 --> 47:20.666
Then the crime scene.

47:21.958 --> 47:23.375
Stick with me.

47:30.125 --> 47:32.750
I'll tell you something,
I don't even like the devil.

47:32.833 --> 47:36.916
You know, Il Diavolo, it sounds classy,
Italian, that's fine, you know,

47:37.000 --> 47:39.125
then my wife, she buys a devil sign,

47:39.208 --> 47:41.125
then she buys the devil lamps

47:41.208 --> 47:44.791
and then people start, "Oh, hey, get him
a devil thing for the bar, he loves it."

47:44.875 --> 47:48.500
And then, you know, uh,
devil, devil, devil, bang, I don't know.

47:48.583 --> 47:50.958
-But that… But that's it, right?
-Yeah.

47:51.041 --> 47:52.166
Oh, yeah.

47:52.250 --> 47:55.125
But, uh…

47:55.208 --> 47:58.708
But you know, it wasn't red though,
it's red now, it's paint.

47:58.791 --> 48:01.166
-Yes, yes, freshly painted.
-I hope. Hmm.

48:01.750 --> 48:05.375
They filled it with some kind of plaster
and stuck the blade in that way.

48:05.458 --> 48:07.833
I'll do whatever it takes to save it.

48:07.916 --> 48:11.125
To cut you out like a cancer.

48:11.208 --> 48:14.458
Hey, hey, hey. Come on, ixnay.
That's not cool. Come on.

48:14.541 --> 48:16.833
The red devil head thing,
that ended up where?

48:16.916 --> 48:21.500
In the church, I threw it at the church
and it broke a window, I don't know why.

48:23.083 --> 48:25.291
And then after the Chrism Mass on Monday,

48:25.375 --> 48:27.708
Martha said she found
a small broken window.

48:27.791 --> 48:28.791
Kids.

48:28.875 --> 48:30.291
But nothing else.

48:30.375 --> 48:33.166
I know what's wrong I don't confuse it

48:34.541 --> 48:36.750
All I'm really trying to say is

48:36.833 --> 48:39.250
Why should the devil have
All the good music?

48:39.916 --> 48:42.333
I feel good every day

48:44.166 --> 48:47.583
Because Jesus is the rock
And he rolled my blues away

48:48.666 --> 48:49.958
Do you see that?

48:50.041 --> 48:52.708
They say to cut my hair
They're driving me insane…

48:53.583 --> 48:54.500
Hmm.

48:56.083 --> 48:56.958
Yeah.

48:58.625 --> 48:59.708
Yeah.

49:03.375 --> 49:05.375
Oh. That is, uh…

49:07.708 --> 49:08.916
Dr. Nat.

49:10.291 --> 49:11.500
Oh, f…

49:13.791 --> 49:15.875
Hey.

49:17.791 --> 49:19.208
Just having some lunch.

49:25.750 --> 49:29.375
Nat, I… I can come over later
if… if you want to talk.

49:29.458 --> 49:31.583
I don't think… Yeah, I… Yeah.

49:31.666 --> 49:33.583
I don't think I'd prefer that.

49:33.666 --> 49:35.083
I'd prefer not that.

49:35.833 --> 49:39.083
Ah, there it is.
Here's what you did it with. Huh?

49:39.625 --> 49:41.791
-Come on, Nat.
-"Cut him out like a cancer."

49:41.875 --> 49:43.666
You son of a bitch.

49:43.750 --> 49:45.375
-You tell him, Nat.
-Yeah.

49:46.583 --> 49:49.708
Son of a bitch! Killer priest!

50:22.166 --> 50:23.083
First off,

50:23.166 --> 50:26.125
I owe Detective Elliott a fruit basket
for giving me your number.

50:26.208 --> 50:28.041
I'm just glad to be of service.

50:28.125 --> 50:29.958
Geraldine, you had the foresight

50:30.041 --> 50:32.625
to see that this goes
way beyond normal police work,

50:32.708 --> 50:36.958
this is something
even I have not experienced.

50:37.041 --> 50:41.125
A textbook example
of a perfectly impossible crime.

50:41.958 --> 50:43.583
The stuff of detective fiction.

50:43.666 --> 50:47.000
This should not exist in our real world.

50:48.041 --> 50:49.458
And yet here it is.

50:50.000 --> 50:51.416
The holy grail.

50:52.500 --> 50:53.750
I love the passion.

50:53.833 --> 50:56.333
I just need to feel confident
you know this case is solvable.

50:56.416 --> 50:58.708
I'm incapable of not solving a crime.

50:59.458 --> 51:01.083
That moment of checkmate

51:01.958 --> 51:05.375
when I take the stage
and unravel my opponent's web…

51:07.125 --> 51:08.416
Oh, you'll see. It's fun!

51:09.000 --> 51:11.166
-Great, how do we get there?
-The source,

51:12.000 --> 51:14.583
John Dickson Carr's The Hollow Man.

51:15.375 --> 51:17.625
A Golden Age detective novel

51:17.708 --> 51:19.833
and a veritable primer
on the locked-door mystery,

51:19.916 --> 51:21.208
the impossible crime.

51:22.958 --> 51:24.041
Hold up.

51:32.375 --> 51:35.875
Father Jud, once again, earning your keep.

51:37.541 --> 51:40.166
Whose Body?
The Murders in the Rue Morgue.

51:40.250 --> 51:42.666
Roger Ackroyd.
The Murder at the Vicarage.

51:42.750 --> 51:47.958
My God, this is practically
a syllabus for how to commit this crime.

51:48.458 --> 51:50.375
And the whole flock is in this group?

51:54.000 --> 51:55.625
Who chose these books?

51:56.291 --> 51:57.125
Oprah.

51:58.333 --> 51:59.333
Oprah.

51:59.833 --> 52:01.916
Martha pulls a theme list
from Oprah's site.

52:02.000 --> 52:03.833
Well, this confirms my theory.

52:04.416 --> 52:06.333
The killer certainly imitated

52:06.416 --> 52:09.166
the traditional methods
of a locked-door mystery story.

52:09.708 --> 52:11.916
Which makes things simple.

52:12.000 --> 52:13.208
Book club time.

52:13.750 --> 52:15.166
Come on, kids.

52:21.833 --> 52:24.166
In The Hollow Man,
the detective Gideon Fell

52:24.250 --> 52:29.166
gives a rundown of all possible methods of
a locked-door killing.

52:29.250 --> 52:31.375
So let's line them up and knock them down.

52:31.458 --> 52:33.583
Possibility number one,

52:33.666 --> 52:37.083
Wicks was stabbed with the knife

52:37.708 --> 52:40.041
before entering the closet.

52:40.625 --> 52:44.041
Father Jud, would you take your place
right where you were?

52:47.208 --> 52:49.333
Wicks completes his sermon.

52:51.083 --> 52:52.750
Any device behind him

52:52.833 --> 52:57.833
capable of propelling
a heavy unbalanced dagger into his back…

53:00.791 --> 53:04.875
would have been hidden from the camera
and the witnesses in the nave,

53:05.500 --> 53:09.000
but certainly would have been
witnessed by Father Jud.

53:10.625 --> 53:13.666
No, I didn't see
a knife-shooting robot behind him.

53:13.750 --> 53:16.291
No. Possibility one, nixed.

53:16.375 --> 53:18.208
Possibility two…

53:20.083 --> 53:21.500
He was killed

53:22.000 --> 53:23.833
while inside the closet

53:23.916 --> 53:27.541
by someone or something that was

53:28.291 --> 53:30.125
outside the closet.

53:30.833 --> 53:34.416
Like, something shot the knife
into the closet from out here?

53:34.500 --> 53:35.916
No, that's nuts.

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
Nuts and impossible on several fronts.

53:38.083 --> 53:41.083
Possibility two, nixed. Progress!

53:41.166 --> 53:43.250
How many more possibilities are there?

53:43.333 --> 53:45.333
Not many. Three…

53:46.166 --> 53:49.041
He was killed while inside the closet

53:49.125 --> 53:51.750
by a device that was also

53:53.041 --> 53:54.541
inside the closet.

53:54.625 --> 53:56.833
So something was placed beforehand and,

53:56.916 --> 53:58.541
what, triggered with a remote?

53:58.625 --> 54:00.625
Well, these walls are thick,

54:00.708 --> 54:04.125
but a very strong RF signal
could blast through 'em.

54:04.875 --> 54:07.083
So where would one hide…

54:07.625 --> 54:12.041
…a fully functional
remote-controlled knife-propelling device

54:12.583 --> 54:14.333
in an empty box, mm?

54:15.125 --> 54:16.875
Wicks fell on his stomach.

54:16.958 --> 54:19.666
I remember that clangy thud.

54:21.583 --> 54:24.083
And his face was towards the door,

54:24.166 --> 54:26.125
so he was standing at the back facing out,

54:27.166 --> 54:30.583
so the knife must have
somehow come through the back wall.

54:31.083 --> 54:33.500
Clangy thud. Very good.

54:34.041 --> 54:35.250
However,

54:36.250 --> 54:38.125
Rock of Gibraltar.

54:38.958 --> 54:40.041
What about…

54:40.541 --> 54:43.125
What about a false wall
that was removed later?

54:43.208 --> 54:45.166
Go to town, Father Brown.

54:45.250 --> 54:46.708
What? No, no.

54:46.791 --> 54:48.875
My boys would have noticed a fake wall.

54:52.750 --> 54:56.583
Yeah. And removing it later
would have been no small task.

54:58.416 --> 55:01.166
Nothing else was found
on the floor of this space, yes?

55:01.833 --> 55:04.458
Nope. No, just the red thread.

55:06.500 --> 55:07.916
Wait, what? The…

55:08.000 --> 55:09.708
The red thread?

55:11.666 --> 55:15.291
Two strings of thick red thread
about three inches long, found there

55:15.375 --> 55:17.375
over by the body next to the hip.

55:19.333 --> 55:20.916
So, what's possibility four?

55:26.125 --> 55:27.208
Martha?

55:28.166 --> 55:30.375
-Throw them out.
-Martha?

55:30.458 --> 55:31.750
Throw them out!

55:31.833 --> 55:35.083
To walk this holy place

55:35.166 --> 55:38.500
like some crime scene. Like some

55:38.583 --> 55:42.208
tawdry police show talking of robots!

55:42.791 --> 55:46.291
It's not right, Father,
it isn't, it's not right!

55:48.916 --> 55:51.541
Martha, you should go home, get some rest.

55:52.083 --> 55:53.208
Can I do anything for you?

55:54.041 --> 55:55.083
Leave.

55:55.791 --> 55:57.625
No one wants you here anymore.

55:58.125 --> 56:03.000
You've always hated the Monsignor
and you have nothing but contempt for us.

56:03.083 --> 56:05.500
-That's not true.
-Murder in your heart…

56:05.583 --> 56:07.208
-No.
-…blood on your hands

56:07.291 --> 56:09.291
just like the harlot whore.

56:09.375 --> 56:12.583
Your original sin has stained this place.

56:13.333 --> 56:15.083
False priest!

56:17.958 --> 56:19.541
Sorry.

56:20.375 --> 56:22.541
But, yeah,
if finding the facts with that detective

56:22.625 --> 56:24.791
puts me against you
and this flock then so be it.

56:27.583 --> 56:28.666
Sorry.

56:39.541 --> 56:41.291
Can I use your bag?

56:42.791 --> 56:44.416
Sure. Go ahead.

56:47.958 --> 56:49.375
Are you okay?

56:50.000 --> 56:53.375
A fog was clearing.
This was a puzzle that was solvable.

56:53.458 --> 56:56.083
The body, the weapon,
the crime scene, robot-knife guns,

56:56.166 --> 56:59.208
and angles of view
and stone walls and remote controls.

57:01.666 --> 57:02.958
And remote controls.

57:03.041 --> 57:06.500
But it's a new day… The Cubs…

57:06.583 --> 57:09.333
who would have been the hero in that game…

57:09.416 --> 57:11.708
But we saw how that went…

57:11.791 --> 57:14.208
You didn't listen to the game
during Friday's service.

57:14.875 --> 57:16.416
On your radio.

57:16.500 --> 57:20.083
I would not. Martha doesn't approve.

57:21.875 --> 57:23.291
So you taped it.

57:23.958 --> 57:25.041
Yep.

57:26.708 --> 57:30.791
Okay. I've overlaid a time stamp
taking into account the broadcast delay.

57:30.875 --> 57:35.125
Dr. Sharp's call to the hospital
happened at 3:47 p.m.

57:35.208 --> 57:37.625
and 90 seconds before that…

57:43.625 --> 57:46.166
So, several things
could have caused that glitch,

57:46.250 --> 57:47.625
but to answer your question, yes,

57:47.708 --> 57:51.208
it is consistent
with a strong burst of RF interference

57:51.291 --> 57:53.833
that you might get
from a souped-up remote control.

57:53.916 --> 57:55.500
Damn.

57:55.583 --> 57:56.500
This is it, right?

57:56.583 --> 57:58.458
This triggered the knife robot.

57:58.541 --> 58:01.333
This has got to be it.
You can… You can solve it now, right?

58:01.416 --> 58:03.833
Did you, um…
Did you sync this up with Cy's footage?

58:03.916 --> 58:07.666
I did, yeah. The iPhone video
has a time stamp. It's very precise.

58:07.750 --> 58:09.750
-Okay. Can you show us please?
-Yeah.

58:09.833 --> 58:10.875
Show us what?

58:10.958 --> 58:13.833
On which hung The salvation of the world

58:16.875 --> 58:17.958
Monsignor?

58:29.333 --> 58:30.791
Oh.

58:30.875 --> 58:33.000
So when the RF burst happened,

58:33.083 --> 58:35.916
he was already on the ground
with a knife in his back

58:36.541 --> 58:38.875
and Father Jud was staring right at him.

58:39.375 --> 58:41.166
How does that work?

58:41.250 --> 58:43.958
Well, for the knife robot, it doesn't.

58:44.041 --> 58:46.625
So… this was nothing?

58:46.708 --> 58:47.625
No, no.

58:47.708 --> 58:51.041
This was very much something.

58:51.125 --> 58:53.958
We have all the pieces
laid out before us now.

58:54.041 --> 58:55.166
-We do?
-Yeah.

58:55.250 --> 58:58.458
Consider the origin
of the devil's head, the red thread,

58:58.541 --> 59:01.958
the clangy clunk,
the timing of the RF remote.

59:02.958 --> 59:04.375
It all lines up.

59:05.500 --> 59:07.708
So give us the answer.

59:08.916 --> 59:10.208
I can't.

59:11.666 --> 59:15.208
You said if you had all the pieces,
you would have an answer.

59:15.291 --> 59:16.541
I know. And yet,

59:16.625 --> 59:18.708
with all the pieces on the table,

59:18.791 --> 59:21.958
this crime still truly appears

59:22.750 --> 59:23.958
impossible.

59:24.791 --> 59:26.500
You told me you could solve this.

59:28.541 --> 59:30.041
That's what you do.

59:31.083 --> 59:33.666
I put my faith in you.

59:33.750 --> 59:37.250
Oh, God. Oh, God.

59:37.333 --> 59:41.375
You haven't slept in 36 hours.
I think it's bedtime.

59:41.458 --> 59:42.541
Yeah.

59:43.166 --> 59:45.875
It's been a hell of a day.
Good night, Father Jud.

59:45.958 --> 59:47.500
Come on. I'll drive you back.

59:56.833 --> 59:59.375
You know, you're right.

59:59.458 --> 01:00:02.083
This can't be impossible.

01:00:03.333 --> 01:00:05.166
There must be a piece missing.

01:00:06.458 --> 01:00:08.458
And I think I know where to find it.

01:00:09.041 --> 01:00:11.791
See, I think there's something in there,
in your head,

01:00:11.875 --> 01:00:14.291
that I need to solve this case.

01:00:14.958 --> 01:00:17.791
And if I can't shake it loose, I'm sorry,

01:00:18.333 --> 01:00:20.750
but I'm gonna have to
go in there and get it.

01:00:23.250 --> 01:00:25.166
Okay, you're freaking me out now.

01:00:27.250 --> 01:00:29.500
I don't… I don't understand.

01:00:29.583 --> 01:00:32.541
I don't get how this will help.
You want me to write the story?

01:00:32.625 --> 01:00:34.833
Yes, the story.

01:00:34.916 --> 01:00:37.625
The story of the Reverend Wicks' murder.

01:00:37.708 --> 01:00:38.791
Monsignor Wicks.

01:00:38.875 --> 01:00:40.708
Monsignor Jalapeño. I don't care.

01:00:40.791 --> 01:00:44.208
I need to see his murder and the events
leading up to it through your eyes.

01:00:44.291 --> 01:00:45.166
Starting where?

01:00:45.250 --> 01:00:46.333
Oh, wherever you like.

01:00:46.416 --> 01:00:49.625
Just keep it interesting,
keep it moving and spare no detail.

01:00:49.708 --> 01:00:51.000
Blanc, I'm not a writer.

01:00:51.083 --> 01:00:53.083
Take your time. Oh.

01:00:53.625 --> 01:00:56.375
I'll be quite comfortable.

01:01:04.041 --> 01:01:07.041
So I've spent the past hour
doing exactly that

01:01:07.541 --> 01:01:10.750
and now I'll put down this pen
and hand it to you

01:01:11.250 --> 01:01:12.458
and I guess, wait

01:01:12.541 --> 01:01:14.458
while you read my story

01:01:14.541 --> 01:01:17.500
of the murder
of Monsignor Jefferson Wicks.

01:01:44.083 --> 01:01:45.291
Why'd you do it?

01:01:48.625 --> 01:01:50.125
Better question is,

01:01:50.708 --> 01:01:53.416
why'd I think I could lie to you
and get away with it?

01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:56.125
Oh, no, you didn't lie.
I knew you wouldn't.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.375
You just didn't say
the dishonest part out loud.

01:02:03.125 --> 01:02:07.625
"When I joined the others outside,
the police were just arriving."

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.625
"Joined the others outside."

01:02:12.125 --> 01:02:14.125
So you stayed inside.

01:02:14.208 --> 01:02:17.041
So you were the only person
with unobserved access

01:02:17.125 --> 01:02:21.500
to the utility closet after the murder,
but before the police searched it.

01:02:23.541 --> 01:02:25.041
Why? I mean…

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.291
Why protect him?

01:02:29.375 --> 01:02:31.375
I didn't do it to protect Wicks.

01:02:33.041 --> 01:02:35.375
I did it to save the people
who believe in him

01:02:35.458 --> 01:02:36.875
just a little disillusionment.

01:02:36.958 --> 01:02:39.791
Well, surely everyone knew.

01:02:39.875 --> 01:02:43.375
I mean, it would have been
on his breath after every Mass.

01:02:43.458 --> 01:02:46.416
"Fortified himself."
Oh, clever wording there.

01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:48.666
But everyone must have known.

01:02:48.750 --> 01:02:50.875
The spirit really moved him today, huh?

01:02:51.541 --> 01:02:52.958
No, not everyone.

01:02:53.458 --> 01:02:54.541
Sam.

01:02:55.333 --> 01:02:57.541
The one good person in this whole place.

01:02:57.625 --> 01:02:59.625
Getting sober saved his life.

01:03:01.041 --> 01:03:04.875
I knew the press and police were there.
Why let that be part of the story?

01:03:07.375 --> 01:03:09.791
Wicks had been stabbed.

01:03:09.875 --> 01:03:13.625
I don't know how or by who,
but I… but I knew he'd been stabbed.

01:03:13.708 --> 01:03:15.708
So this had nothing to do with it.

01:03:15.791 --> 01:03:17.916
It was an impulse.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.541
A little storytelling to protect my flock.

01:03:20.625 --> 01:03:22.250
Oh, bullshit!

01:03:22.333 --> 01:03:26.416
And in protecting their bubble of belief,
you have shielded a killer!

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.625
Where is that flask?

01:03:31.916 --> 01:03:34.833
Shit!

01:03:37.458 --> 01:03:39.666
Shit. It's not here.

01:03:40.833 --> 01:03:41.916
Blanc.

01:03:42.875 --> 01:03:44.083
I'm sorry.

01:03:44.708 --> 01:03:46.708
He was stabbed, so I didn't think--

01:03:46.791 --> 01:03:48.916
No. You did not think.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.291
But we're into the woods now,
so you better start.

01:03:53.291 --> 01:03:55.125
Someone broke into my room.

01:03:56.125 --> 01:03:57.416
It's just hitting me.

01:03:57.958 --> 01:04:00.791
This is devious,
it's calculated against me.

01:04:00.875 --> 01:04:03.208
And now you see
the enemy we're up against.

01:04:05.125 --> 01:04:08.000
You have listened to this flock's stories
with empathy and grace,

01:04:08.083 --> 01:04:09.833
but we're done with that now.

01:04:09.916 --> 01:04:11.541
We've wasted enough time.

01:04:11.625 --> 01:04:14.041
Tomorrow we use
the gathering at the burial

01:04:14.125 --> 01:04:15.750
to question them all together.

01:04:15.833 --> 01:04:18.666
We must discover what happened that night.

01:04:19.750 --> 01:04:23.833
And what this flock
of wicked wolves is hiding.

01:04:29.041 --> 01:04:29.916
Mm.

01:04:40.916 --> 01:04:42.333
Betrayed.

01:04:43.333 --> 01:04:44.541
Beaten.

01:04:46.666 --> 01:04:47.875
Mocked.

01:04:48.916 --> 01:04:50.125
Pierced.

01:04:52.291 --> 01:04:53.375
Murdered.

01:04:57.375 --> 01:05:00.000
And left in a hole to rot.

01:05:00.916 --> 01:05:02.000
To be forgotten.

01:05:03.208 --> 01:05:06.041
As with our Savior, so with the church.

01:05:06.708 --> 01:05:10.208
Our church is assailed
by wicked modernity,

01:05:10.291 --> 01:05:12.500
by the enemies of God.

01:05:12.583 --> 01:05:14.583
The harlot whores,

01:05:14.666 --> 01:05:18.000
the vermin who would oppress and silence

01:05:18.083 --> 01:05:20.500
and bar us from our rightful place

01:05:20.583 --> 01:05:23.208
as the rulers
of a Christian nation of faith.

01:05:23.708 --> 01:05:26.791
And even as I stand before you
as a warrior of Christ,

01:05:26.875 --> 01:05:30.708
in the armor of God ready to fight
the world to my last breath,

01:05:30.791 --> 01:05:33.333
you shall not pass!

01:05:36.041 --> 01:05:39.125
As our Lord was, I am betrayed by Judas.

01:05:39.666 --> 01:05:41.500
Gentlemen, may I have a moment?

01:05:42.250 --> 01:05:44.250
Judas in many forms.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.833
Always the true threat comes from within.

01:05:50.291 --> 01:05:52.125
Remember my words.

01:05:53.583 --> 01:05:56.958
On this Good Friday,
remember what's to come.

01:05:57.041 --> 01:05:59.041
Remember, all of you.

01:06:00.666 --> 01:06:02.958
You will rise again.

01:06:04.125 --> 01:06:05.541
It will be okay.

01:06:06.041 --> 01:06:07.666
You will rise again.

01:06:08.291 --> 01:06:09.500
You will rise.

01:06:09.583 --> 01:06:12.958
The hour approaches.
The hour I have warned you about.

01:06:14.541 --> 01:06:17.541
Remember what I have promised you all,
come Easter Sunday.

01:06:17.625 --> 01:06:21.458
For I will make good
on that promise, yes, I will.

01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:25.708
For behold, though He is struck down,

01:06:25.791 --> 01:06:29.125
the righteous Son of God will rise again.

01:06:29.666 --> 01:06:32.083
Eve's Apple restored to the tree

01:06:32.166 --> 01:06:35.833
and the wealth of His kingdom
and His rising reign.

01:06:36.458 --> 01:06:39.291
And as you gnash your teeth
in the darkness,

01:06:39.375 --> 01:06:41.000
you unfaithful devils,

01:06:41.083 --> 01:06:45.500
as you lie cold and forgotten and alone,

01:06:45.583 --> 01:06:50.000
He will rise again to reclaim what is His.

01:06:50.666 --> 01:06:52.291
And strike down the wicked

01:06:53.041 --> 01:06:56.083
and raise His true Son
to the throne of this nation!

01:06:56.166 --> 01:06:59.375
Yes, He will rise! Yes, He will rise!

01:06:59.458 --> 01:07:02.083
Yes, tremble in fear,

01:07:02.166 --> 01:07:07.666
for He will rise again in glory
and vengeance and power!

01:07:17.541 --> 01:07:20.791
Sorry about your loss, Father.
Here, sign on the bottom.

01:07:21.666 --> 01:07:23.041
Listen, between you and me,

01:07:23.125 --> 01:07:26.458
I don't care what the Internet says.
I think there's a chance you didn't do it.

01:07:29.666 --> 01:07:31.875
All right, everyone. Listen up.

01:07:31.958 --> 01:07:34.208
Oh, would you look who it is.
It's Judas Jud.

01:07:34.291 --> 01:07:37.166
Father, you are not welcome here.

01:07:37.250 --> 01:07:38.458
All right, stop!

01:07:38.541 --> 01:07:39.750
Here's what's gonna happen.

01:07:39.833 --> 01:07:42.416
Benoit fricken' Blanc and I are
gonna ask you all some questions,

01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:45.666
you'll answer them and we'll get to
the bottom of who killed Monsignor Wicks

01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:48.000
and why and then…

01:07:48.791 --> 01:07:50.208
That's it!

01:07:50.291 --> 01:07:53.125
Okay? Okay, so…

01:07:54.916 --> 01:07:57.041
Thank you, Father Jud, that was

01:07:57.125 --> 01:07:58.291
very good. Um,

01:07:58.375 --> 01:08:00.000
and we're gonna start…

01:08:00.083 --> 01:08:04.166
…with what happened that night
right here in this very room.

01:08:04.250 --> 01:08:07.291
You mean the time Jud admitted
to all of us that he killed a man.

01:08:07.375 --> 01:08:10.416
Okay, no, that was…
That was the boxing thing, I was--

01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:13.458
And now he's covering his ass
by attacking us. He's a PINO.

01:08:13.541 --> 01:08:14.500
A… a PINO?

01:08:14.583 --> 01:08:16.166
Priest in name only.

01:08:16.250 --> 01:08:20.375
Helping Benoit Blanc
crack the mystery of the evil, evil church

01:08:20.458 --> 01:08:23.708
and then some libtard
will make a podcast about all of this

01:08:23.791 --> 01:08:27.708
and before you know it, the idiot versions
of all of us will end up on Netflix.

01:08:27.791 --> 01:08:30.500
Oh, the idiot versions. God forbid.

01:08:31.916 --> 01:08:33.291
Jesus!

01:08:33.375 --> 01:08:34.791
It's a miracle!

01:08:36.041 --> 01:08:38.916
-I can walk, Martha. It just hurts.
-Oh.

01:08:39.958 --> 01:08:41.875
-Oh.
-And I say, good.

01:08:42.541 --> 01:08:43.750
Expose it all.

01:08:44.291 --> 01:08:46.041
Wicks was a con man.

01:08:46.791 --> 01:08:50.208
Miracles and supernatural
power of God bullshit.

01:08:50.791 --> 01:08:53.000
I really believed.

01:08:54.875 --> 01:08:56.500
I still wanna believe.

01:08:56.583 --> 01:08:58.291
How sick is that?

01:08:58.791 --> 01:09:03.041
Well, actually, I was inquiring
not about Jud's prayer group,

01:09:03.125 --> 01:09:05.541
but about the shadowy meeting with Wicks

01:09:05.625 --> 01:09:08.625
that took place in this room
on Palm Sunday.

01:09:12.958 --> 01:09:16.416
What was that meeting actually about?

01:09:18.458 --> 01:09:20.291
Who wants to go first?

01:09:21.625 --> 01:09:22.833
I'll tell you.

01:09:26.041 --> 01:09:29.083
-Cy. Hey. Wait, hold on, buddy. Hey!
-No, no, no.

01:09:29.166 --> 01:09:30.916
You shut your mouth,
you little shit weasel.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.708
-It isn't your decision!
-Tell him nothing!

01:09:32.791 --> 01:09:34.541
Hey, look… Whoa. Easy, Father Jud.

01:09:34.625 --> 01:09:36.625
I promise you that
what we talked about that night

01:09:36.708 --> 01:09:39.208
has nothing to do
with Wicks' killing, okay?

01:09:39.291 --> 01:09:42.083
But it does have to do with things that,
if made public,

01:09:42.166 --> 01:09:43.625
could ruin people in this room.

01:09:43.708 --> 01:09:46.333
I recorded the whole thing. Just hit play.

01:09:48.875 --> 01:09:50.875
-No! This is not--
-You scoundrel!

01:09:50.958 --> 01:09:54.416
-Open this door, you bastard!
-You are defiling my files!

01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:56.250
-Play it.
-Open it--

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.416
All right. Very dramatic, Vera.

01:10:10.416 --> 01:10:12.500
You've got your audience.
What's this about?

01:10:16.208 --> 01:10:18.416
I've been thinking about your mom.

01:10:19.875 --> 01:10:24.791
I never knew her,
but growing up in this church,

01:10:24.875 --> 01:10:28.083
I knew the story of the harlot whore

01:10:28.166 --> 01:10:31.583
and I've been thinking about
what her life must have been like

01:10:31.666 --> 01:10:35.625
to be trapped in a house,
with her father and her son.

01:10:36.458 --> 01:10:39.625
Closing rank, shaming her

01:10:39.708 --> 01:10:42.125
and teaching us all to shame her.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:45.416
That poor girl.

01:10:51.791 --> 01:10:56.625
Yesterday, I got a call
from a family law colleague in Brooklyn.

01:10:57.375 --> 01:11:00.583
He wanted to double-check contact details

01:11:00.666 --> 01:11:04.375
for Monsignor Jefferson Wicks, my client,

01:11:04.458 --> 01:11:08.541
because my client
had filed an AOP with him.

01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:10.708
In Brooklyn.

01:11:11.458 --> 01:11:13.666
So I would not know.

01:11:14.708 --> 01:11:16.250
What's an AOP?

01:11:19.625 --> 01:11:22.041
"Acknowledgement of parentage"?

01:11:25.375 --> 01:11:28.166
"Affirmation that I, Jefferson Wicks,

01:11:28.250 --> 01:11:31.625
am the biological father of Cyrus Draven."

01:11:36.666 --> 01:11:39.083
No shame for you.

01:11:40.125 --> 01:11:42.041
Right?

01:11:42.125 --> 01:11:43.666
Who was the mother?

01:11:45.208 --> 01:11:46.833
Does it even matter?

01:11:47.458 --> 01:11:53.291
No. No! No, she came back
and dropped this poor kid in your lap.

01:11:53.916 --> 01:11:56.250
And then she went and had a life.

01:11:56.333 --> 01:11:59.833
And my faithful father came to the rescue.

01:11:59.916 --> 01:12:04.250
Once again, the boys club closed ranks
and there I was, the loyal little idiot.

01:12:04.333 --> 01:12:05.541
Trapped.

01:12:05.625 --> 01:12:10.875
And I obeyed
and I honored and raised your son

01:12:10.958 --> 01:12:14.041
while you sat on your pulpit, shameless.

01:12:14.125 --> 01:12:17.916
You… hypocritical son of a bitch!

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:24.083
Cy?

01:12:24.708 --> 01:12:25.708
Did you know?

01:12:25.791 --> 01:12:27.791
Not until Vera told me this morning.

01:12:28.458 --> 01:12:29.375
Yes.

01:12:30.291 --> 01:12:31.916
Cy is my son.

01:12:34.625 --> 01:12:36.458
From a loose woman of no importance

01:12:36.541 --> 01:12:39.333
who I knew for one night
and haven't seen in 30 years.

01:12:39.416 --> 01:12:42.416
Vera's father and I kept this secret.
But no longer.

01:12:42.958 --> 01:12:44.625
He is my heir.

01:12:46.041 --> 01:12:47.125
My son.

01:12:49.625 --> 01:12:51.750
Now the world is going to know it.

01:12:53.208 --> 01:12:55.416
So, rats,

01:12:56.500 --> 01:12:57.791
flee the sinking ship.

01:13:01.166 --> 01:13:02.625
Oh, cut the shit.

01:13:02.708 --> 01:13:04.500
You're all standing by your man.

01:13:04.583 --> 01:13:07.875
I just wanted to see it.
I wanted to see for myself.

01:13:07.958 --> 01:13:10.875
You eat his shit with a spoon
and come back for seconds.

01:13:10.958 --> 01:13:12.750
That's kind of condescending, Vera.

01:13:12.833 --> 01:13:14.791
-You don't know what we're feeling.
-Oh.

01:13:14.875 --> 01:13:18.916
I think we're all, as Christians,
very shaken up by what you just said.

01:13:20.916 --> 01:13:23.625
But we're fighting an existential war here

01:13:23.708 --> 01:13:25.750
where the end justifies the means.

01:13:25.833 --> 01:13:27.666
The church doesn't need
some pussy who's gonna

01:13:27.750 --> 01:13:29.791
lie down and take it, we need a warrior.

01:13:29.875 --> 01:13:31.500
We need a warrior

01:13:31.583 --> 01:13:35.666
and I believe that God chose
Monsignor Wicks to be His warrior.

01:13:36.416 --> 01:13:39.250
So, you and your son have my sword.

01:13:39.958 --> 01:13:41.000
And…

01:13:42.083 --> 01:13:43.708
we don't know this woman.

01:13:44.708 --> 01:13:46.333
We do not know her.

01:13:46.916 --> 01:13:49.541
We do not know, right, how she…

01:13:51.541 --> 01:13:54.166
What is truth? Right?
With various sources.

01:13:54.250 --> 01:13:56.708
We don't know that… We don't… What exists?

01:13:56.791 --> 01:13:58.416
Does any of this exist?

01:13:58.500 --> 01:14:01.125
So…

01:14:01.208 --> 01:14:02.500
Well said, Doc.

01:14:02.583 --> 01:14:03.750
Thank you.

01:14:04.458 --> 01:14:07.083
You promised if I stuck with you,
you could heal me.

01:14:08.291 --> 01:14:09.500
If that's true,

01:14:10.041 --> 01:14:11.666
I don't need you to be a saint.

01:14:12.166 --> 01:14:13.708
We're with you, Monsignor Wicks.

01:14:14.375 --> 01:14:18.833
And literally nothing that you say or do
is gonna change that.

01:14:25.916 --> 01:14:28.666
I will give my final service

01:14:30.083 --> 01:14:32.500
a week from today on Easter Sunday.

01:14:33.791 --> 01:14:35.208
And then

01:14:35.958 --> 01:14:39.875
I will close the doors
of this sad little church for good.

01:14:43.250 --> 01:14:47.500
But not before I have destroyed
each and every one of you.

01:14:50.750 --> 01:14:51.958
Sorry. Wait, what?

01:14:52.041 --> 01:14:53.458
Your drinking, Nat?

01:14:53.541 --> 01:14:54.750
Yeah. What?

01:14:54.833 --> 01:14:56.583
Oh, you're a dangerous man.

01:14:57.333 --> 01:14:58.750
Going to work drunk.

01:14:58.833 --> 01:15:01.916
Treating patients, children, while drunk.

01:15:02.708 --> 01:15:04.541
This community should know.

01:15:04.625 --> 01:15:06.708
The medical board should know.

01:15:06.791 --> 01:15:11.166
No one must ever trust or hire you again.

01:15:11.791 --> 01:15:12.875
And, Lee.

01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:16.500
This, uh, Troubadour book
you've been writing.

01:15:16.583 --> 01:15:21.291
Its bootlicking idiocy
is an affront to my ministry.

01:15:21.375 --> 01:15:25.208
It… It's my duty to warn
not only the public but…

01:15:25.291 --> 01:15:27.291
…my friends in the publishing world.

01:15:27.375 --> 01:15:30.250
It must be buried. You must be buried.

01:15:30.833 --> 01:15:34.458
Exposed as the irrelevant clown
that you are.

01:15:34.541 --> 01:15:36.958
What the hell?
What is even happening right now?

01:15:37.041 --> 01:15:38.125
And, Vera.

01:15:38.666 --> 01:15:41.000
You are your father's nightmare.

01:15:41.791 --> 01:15:43.416
He would be so ashamed.

01:15:45.333 --> 01:15:48.416
Simone. I cannot heal a faithless woman.

01:15:49.125 --> 01:15:50.541
I cannot help you.

01:15:50.625 --> 01:15:53.125
You said you could cast it out of me.

01:15:53.208 --> 01:15:55.000
Mm, I promised you nothing.

01:15:56.166 --> 01:15:58.791
I've given you all of my savings.

01:15:58.875 --> 01:16:00.958
You cannot buy God's healing.

01:16:01.750 --> 01:16:03.583
You will never be healed.

01:16:03.666 --> 01:16:06.500
You will die in pain
in the prison of that chair.

01:16:07.125 --> 01:16:10.166
Why are you doing this?
I don't understand.

01:16:10.250 --> 01:16:13.416
-This is a joke. Right? A joke.
-I am so confused.

01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:16.750
Is this payback for the Father Jud prayer
meeting because he ambushed us.

01:16:16.833 --> 01:16:18.416
Father Jud's prayer meeting?

01:16:19.875 --> 01:16:21.791
I have kept this church.

01:16:21.875 --> 01:16:24.000
I have fortified it with the truth of God.

01:16:24.083 --> 01:16:27.916
And now the betrayal to find my authority

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:31.291
and faith and life itself challenged…

01:16:31.375 --> 01:16:33.791
…and from inside my own sanctuary!

01:16:36.333 --> 01:16:37.541
Get out!

01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:41.750
Weak.

01:16:42.583 --> 01:16:44.000
All of you.

01:16:44.083 --> 01:16:46.291
You can't follow my path.

01:16:46.375 --> 01:16:48.583
Yes, we are at war

01:16:48.666 --> 01:16:51.125
and I cast you out of my fortress.

01:16:51.708 --> 01:16:52.916
You son of a bitch.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.875
On Easter Sunday,
when the pews fill with townspeople,

01:16:55.958 --> 01:16:58.375
I will lay bare the sins of this flock.

01:16:58.458 --> 01:17:02.875
Cut you loose and shake the dust
of this place off of my sandals.

01:17:04.083 --> 01:17:05.291
And to hell

01:17:06.625 --> 01:17:07.708
with you all.

01:17:21.416 --> 01:17:25.583
Well, glory be. That cleared the room.

01:17:25.666 --> 01:17:26.750
Cy.

01:17:28.041 --> 01:17:30.125
Why'd he do that?

01:17:30.208 --> 01:17:32.458
Cy. Tell me. What was happening?

01:17:32.541 --> 01:17:34.916
Why'd he torch them all?
Why would he do that?

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:36.333
Because I told him to.

01:17:37.291 --> 01:17:39.916
When Vera told me the truth,
I went and found him.

01:17:40.791 --> 01:17:44.000
And he embraced me as a son
for the first time in my life.

01:17:44.750 --> 01:17:46.666
He unburdened himself.

01:17:47.375 --> 01:17:49.375
I hate this place.

01:17:50.541 --> 01:17:52.958
I hate this sad flock of losers.

01:17:53.791 --> 01:17:55.416
I want to get out.

01:17:56.208 --> 01:17:57.833
And now, finally…

01:17:58.958 --> 01:18:00.166
I can.

01:18:01.958 --> 01:18:03.166
He told me,

01:18:03.958 --> 01:18:06.791
his grandfather's family fortune,
lost all these years,

01:18:06.875 --> 01:18:09.083
he told me he found it. Just this week.

01:18:09.166 --> 01:18:11.000
No. No, that money is gone.

01:18:11.083 --> 01:18:14.791
Nobody knows where Prentice put it,
but it's gone without a trace.

01:18:14.875 --> 01:18:17.500
He told me he found it.

01:18:17.583 --> 01:18:20.625
He was gonna shutter this dump
and retire in filthy wealth.

01:18:21.291 --> 01:18:24.416
And I told him, "Are you nuts?"

01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:27.291
Retire? Do you know the power
of what you do on that stage?

01:18:27.375 --> 01:18:28.625
I've shrunk the flock.

01:18:28.708 --> 01:18:30.375
No. You've radicalized them.

01:18:31.041 --> 01:18:32.083
That is power.

01:18:32.875 --> 01:18:36.875
In a small town, there are only so many
witches to burn and zealots to activate.

01:18:36.958 --> 01:18:39.375
Your flame lacks fuel.

01:18:39.458 --> 01:18:40.875
But on the Internet,

01:18:41.375 --> 01:18:42.583
wildfire.

01:18:43.875 --> 01:18:45.083
This money.

01:18:45.875 --> 01:18:48.708
Your cult of personality.
Are you kidding me?

01:18:48.791 --> 01:18:50.333
Give me four years.

01:18:50.416 --> 01:18:51.833
You could be president.

01:18:52.916 --> 01:18:55.041
Together we can build a real empire.

01:18:56.250 --> 01:18:59.250
As father and son.

01:19:01.666 --> 01:19:03.083
Like in Star Wars?

01:19:03.166 --> 01:19:05.958
-Yeah. Exactly, like the Rebels.
-Oh.

01:19:06.041 --> 01:19:09.458
His ministry and my political instincts
fueled by enough money.

01:19:09.541 --> 01:19:11.833
Can you imagine
what we could do in Christ's name?

01:19:12.500 --> 01:19:14.125
Yeah. Yeah, I think I can.

01:19:14.208 --> 01:19:17.541
First, I told him,
and I'll admit this is a little personal,

01:19:17.625 --> 01:19:20.375
first I told him
we need to burn this flock.

01:19:20.458 --> 01:19:21.833
They're a liability.

01:19:21.916 --> 01:19:24.041
If they associate themselves with us,

01:19:24.125 --> 01:19:27.000
show up on cable news,
even want a place in this thing…

01:19:27.083 --> 01:19:29.333
We need to burn them off like leeches.

01:19:30.250 --> 01:19:31.875
That's why he torched them all.

01:19:32.541 --> 01:19:34.375
'Cause of your petty vindictiveness.

01:19:34.958 --> 01:19:37.500
One of them might have killed him for it.
You know that, right?

01:19:38.083 --> 01:19:40.916
Getting back to this vast fortune.

01:19:41.500 --> 01:19:42.791
So it's yours now?

01:19:42.875 --> 01:19:44.625
-Technically, yes.
-Technically?

01:19:45.208 --> 01:19:47.416
-He didn't tell you where it was.
-No.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.208
His accounts are empty. There's nothing.

01:19:51.083 --> 01:19:51.958
So where is it?

01:19:52.708 --> 01:19:55.291
And then, I realized, 50 years ago,

01:19:55.375 --> 01:19:59.125
what was the safest way
for Prentice to hide $80 million?

01:19:59.708 --> 01:20:02.500
-A Swiss bank account.
-Aha!

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:06.416
And so all you need to do
is find that account number.

01:20:07.333 --> 01:20:08.750
No luck there?

01:20:08.833 --> 01:20:11.583
It has to be written down somewhere.

01:20:11.666 --> 01:20:13.916
Martha files everything and it isn't here.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:15.208
I don't know.

01:20:15.791 --> 01:20:18.666
Here. I thought it might be a code
because he kept saying,

01:20:18.750 --> 01:20:20.541
"Eve's Apple
would be restored to the tree."

01:20:20.625 --> 01:20:24.208
That was a thing.
As if Eve's Apple is the fortune.

01:20:24.291 --> 01:20:26.750
But a Swiss account,
we're looking for 19 numbers,

01:20:26.833 --> 01:20:28.041
so it doesn't work.

01:20:28.583 --> 01:20:30.708
Vera, did he ever tell you anything?

01:20:31.583 --> 01:20:34.708
Even if he did, I would go to my grave
before giving it to you.

01:20:35.500 --> 01:20:36.583
Yeah.

01:20:37.666 --> 01:20:40.916
You'd have done anything to keep
the prodigal son from getting the fortune.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.208
It burns you up.

01:20:42.916 --> 01:20:44.333
You bitter hag.

01:20:45.375 --> 01:20:46.791
That money

01:20:47.375 --> 01:20:52.791
is one psalm in the Bible
of my bitterness, you fucking child.

01:20:53.458 --> 01:20:57.541
You should come and get your shit,
it'll be out on the street.

01:21:03.208 --> 01:21:06.625
You. You're a detective. I'll pay you.
I don't care, this is very important,

01:21:06.708 --> 01:21:09.541
my inheritance
and future political career depends on it.

01:21:09.625 --> 01:21:11.750
Can you think of anything

01:21:11.833 --> 01:21:15.250
related to Eve's Apple
that might contain that number?

01:21:17.208 --> 01:21:20.291
Oh, um… Mm-mm.

01:21:20.916 --> 01:21:22.750
But if you think of anything,
you'll call me?

01:21:22.833 --> 01:21:24.833
-Oh, yeah. You bet.
-All right.

01:21:32.208 --> 01:21:33.541
We should look everywhere.

01:21:38.458 --> 01:21:41.541
It might be, uh, sewn in the lining.

01:21:42.166 --> 01:21:44.458
Etched in the metal.

01:22:04.875 --> 01:22:06.166
This is hollow.

01:22:06.750 --> 01:22:08.166
Yeah. Do it.

01:22:29.625 --> 01:22:31.250
Remind me to file this.

01:22:31.333 --> 01:22:32.541
File that.

01:22:33.791 --> 01:22:35.750
-It doesn't make sense.
-I know.

01:22:35.833 --> 01:22:37.875
An 80-million-dollar fortune.

01:22:37.958 --> 01:22:39.708
But if Eve's Apple is the fortune

01:22:39.791 --> 01:22:42.875
and it's not a pile of cash
in a Swiss account somewhere, what is it?

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:47.833
What?

01:22:47.916 --> 01:22:50.000
They must have
misprinted the date on this.

01:22:51.083 --> 01:22:54.583
It says the crypt opening thing
was ordered last Wednesday.

01:22:55.250 --> 01:22:56.666
That can't be right.

01:22:58.541 --> 01:23:01.750
Who would preorder burial equipment
for a man who isn't dead?

01:23:03.125 --> 01:23:06.250
Someone who knew with great certainty
when their day and hour would come.

01:23:06.333 --> 01:23:07.541
Give me that.

01:23:08.583 --> 01:23:11.375
Oh, that's computer printed.
That's not a misprint. That's it.

01:23:11.458 --> 01:23:13.916
Whoever called in that order,
that's the key.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:15.583
Okay. Yeah. Yeah.

01:23:19.333 --> 01:23:21.458
Steel Wheels Construction. This is Louise.

01:23:21.541 --> 01:23:24.083
Hello, Louise. It's Father Jud
from Perpetual Fortitude.

01:23:25.250 --> 01:23:27.416
-Oh. Hello.
-Hi, Louise.

01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:29.916
We had a piece
of your construction equipment here today.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.583
-Uh, a forklift to open a, um… a crypt.
-Oh, yeah. I know.

01:23:32.666 --> 01:23:35.041
It's not too often
we get a crypt opening order.

01:23:35.125 --> 01:23:36.458
Great. So I need to know--

01:23:36.541 --> 01:23:38.875
I actually processed that order.
I do all the processing.

01:23:38.958 --> 01:23:40.625
Yeah. What I need to know, Louise, is--

01:23:40.708 --> 01:23:42.708
-I run this place with my brother James.
-Right.

01:23:42.791 --> 01:23:44.916
-He takes orders but I process them.
-Yeah. Right.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
So the reason I'm calling, Louise, is to--

01:23:47.083 --> 01:23:49.833
I've been to that church of yours,
but I don't think you were there.

01:23:49.916 --> 01:23:52.916
-No, I… I'm new, relatively new here.
-Congratulations.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.750
-Louise, I… I have to ask…
-No, it was an older guy.

01:23:55.833 --> 01:23:58.208
-Father… Is he…
-Monsignor, Monsignor.

01:23:58.291 --> 01:24:00.041
-Father Monsignor, okay, well…
-Louise--

01:24:00.125 --> 01:24:03.625
He was preaching when I went and
I gotta tell you, that is not a nice man.

01:24:03.708 --> 01:24:06.500
-But I am sorry that he…
-Okay.

01:24:06.583 --> 01:24:09.000
…yikes, died and,
you know, for all y'all's loss…

01:24:09.083 --> 01:24:11.500
Yeah, it's a terrible tragedy
for everyone, Louise.

01:24:11.583 --> 01:24:14.000
Can I… I have to, uh, interrupt.

01:24:14.083 --> 01:24:16.083
-I have a question.
-Yeah.

01:24:16.166 --> 01:24:19.541
Uh, the order for the forklift.
I need to know who placed the order.

01:24:19.625 --> 01:24:22.041
-James takes the orders and…
-James takes the orders.

01:24:22.125 --> 01:24:24.708
-…he's left for the day.
-Can I have James' number?

01:24:24.791 --> 01:24:27.416
This is very important. We need to
find out who placed that order.

01:24:27.500 --> 01:24:30.875
-No, no. I don't think I can do that…
-No, it's very important.

01:24:30.958 --> 01:24:33.083
-Excuse me, Father.
-It's very--

01:24:33.166 --> 01:24:35.166
What I can do, as I was saying,

01:24:35.250 --> 01:24:38.125
is I can get that information for you
and then I will give you

01:24:38.208 --> 01:24:39.833
-a buzz back.
-That's it. That's great.

01:24:39.916 --> 01:24:42.541
And if you could call James now,
I would appreciate it so much.

01:24:42.625 --> 01:24:44.541
-Thank you, Louise.
-And she'll call you back.

01:24:44.625 --> 01:24:46.708
I will. Hey, Father,
could I ask you something?

01:24:46.791 --> 01:24:49.000
Yeah, it's… Though, I mean…

01:24:49.583 --> 01:24:51.083
Well, if you can make it quick.

01:24:51.166 --> 01:24:54.125
-This is a priority for us right now.
-Maybe she could call you back and--

01:24:54.208 --> 01:24:56.208
Father Jud would you… Could you…

01:24:57.708 --> 01:24:58.791
Louise?

01:24:58.875 --> 01:25:00.583
Oh, God.

01:25:02.250 --> 01:25:03.333
Louise?

01:25:03.958 --> 01:25:05.958
Will you pray for me?

01:25:09.500 --> 01:25:10.416
Uh…

01:25:11.375 --> 01:25:13.000
Yeah, of course.

01:25:14.416 --> 01:25:17.250
-Can I ask what for?
-Uh…

01:25:18.708 --> 01:25:20.333
It's, uh, my mother.

01:25:22.666 --> 01:25:23.875
She's sick?

01:25:24.625 --> 01:25:25.708
Yeah.

01:25:25.791 --> 01:25:28.333
Um, she's in hospice.

01:25:29.708 --> 01:25:31.333
I'm so sorry, Louise.

01:25:31.416 --> 01:25:33.416
Uh, she won't talk to me.

01:25:33.500 --> 01:25:35.583
We fought last time we talked.

01:25:35.666 --> 01:25:41.458
Uh, she has a tumor in her brain
that's affecting her,

01:25:41.541 --> 01:25:45.083
and it's making her say
really terrible things,

01:25:45.166 --> 01:25:47.291
and so I said bad things back

01:25:47.375 --> 01:25:50.083
and now I'm afraid that
that's gonna be the last thing

01:25:50.166 --> 01:25:52.166
that we ever say to each other.

01:25:54.833 --> 01:25:56.916
Father, I, um…

01:25:58.833 --> 01:26:02.250
I'm feeling pretty alone, um, right now.

01:26:05.541 --> 01:26:08.750
I'm so sorry, Louise.

01:26:10.083 --> 01:26:11.291
You're not alone.

01:26:12.750 --> 01:26:14.166
I'm right here.

01:26:14.958 --> 01:26:16.166
I'm here.

01:26:17.041 --> 01:26:18.541
Can you tell me your mother's name?

01:26:47.458 --> 01:26:50.083
I pray that Barbara
may feel her daughter's love.

01:26:51.166 --> 01:26:55.000
That it will comfort her in this time,
and, Lord, I pray for Louise.

01:26:56.416 --> 01:26:58.625
Be with her
and give her wisdom and guidance.

01:26:58.708 --> 01:27:02.125
Hold her in your healing arms
and let her know she is loved.

01:27:02.666 --> 01:27:04.291
She is not alone.

01:27:04.916 --> 01:27:08.333
This we pray
through Christ our Lord. Amen.

01:27:09.166 --> 01:27:10.125
Okay, Louise.

01:27:10.750 --> 01:27:13.416
You have my number.
Any time, day or night,

01:27:13.500 --> 01:27:14.791
I'm here for you.

01:27:15.291 --> 01:27:17.250
This church is here for you.

01:27:17.333 --> 01:27:18.500
Bless you. Okay.

01:27:19.041 --> 01:27:22.041
Storm. I came to close up.

01:27:23.791 --> 01:27:26.416
I'll get the church.
You take care of the rectory.

01:27:30.375 --> 01:27:32.625
Don't follow me, Blanc. I'm done.

01:27:32.708 --> 01:27:34.541
And, uh, why exactly?

01:27:34.625 --> 01:27:37.083
I've had a "road to Damascus" thing.

01:27:37.166 --> 01:27:39.750
Paul had a holy revelation
on the road to Damascus.

01:27:39.833 --> 01:27:42.708
Yes, I know. He was struck blind
and all that hogwash.

01:27:42.791 --> 01:27:44.791
Probably just a case of pink eye.

01:27:44.875 --> 01:27:48.375
But he was not on the verge
of solving a murder when it happened.

01:27:48.458 --> 01:27:50.875
I mean, what do you think
we're doing here?

01:27:51.541 --> 01:27:54.958
Why do you think I became a priest?
No bullshit. Really. Why?

01:27:58.208 --> 01:27:59.416
You felt guilt.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
For taking a life. And the church,

01:28:02.083 --> 01:28:04.916
it offered you a place to hide
and a clear method

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
to give you a sense of absolution.

01:28:07.625 --> 01:28:10.500
The guy I killed in the ring, I hated him.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:12.833
I remember, I knew he was in trouble

01:28:12.916 --> 01:28:15.125
and I kept going and going
until I felt him break.

01:28:15.208 --> 01:28:17.833
It wasn't an accident.
I killed him with hate in my heart.

01:28:17.916 --> 01:28:20.250
There's no hiding from that,
there's no solving it.

01:28:20.333 --> 01:28:24.166
God didn't hide me or fix me.
He loves me when I'm guilty.

01:28:24.250 --> 01:28:26.375
That's what I should be doing
for these people.

01:28:26.458 --> 01:28:27.750
Not this whodunit game.

01:28:27.833 --> 01:28:29.083
No, now wait a minute.

01:28:35.375 --> 01:28:37.583
Excuse me. Excuse me, I--

01:28:38.333 --> 01:28:40.166
Would you look at me
when I'm talking to you?

01:28:40.250 --> 01:28:42.250
We're looking for a murderer.
This is not a game.

01:28:42.333 --> 01:28:43.708
It is a game!

01:28:43.791 --> 01:28:45.416
Solving it, winning it.

01:28:45.500 --> 01:28:47.541
Getting your big checkmate moment.

01:28:47.625 --> 01:28:51.458
And by using me in it, you're setting me
against my real and only purpose in life.

01:28:51.541 --> 01:28:54.166
Which is not to fight the wicked
and bring them to justice,

01:28:54.250 --> 01:28:57.458
but to serve them
and bring them to Christ.

01:28:57.541 --> 01:28:59.375
Otherwise, I'm just as bad as Wicks.

01:28:59.458 --> 01:29:01.458
Making it about me and not Jesus.

01:29:02.500 --> 01:29:04.916
Listen, you don't
have to understand, Blanc.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:06.541
But just please,

01:29:06.625 --> 01:29:08.916
please, please, please let me be.

01:29:15.625 --> 01:29:17.458
-Can you say that again?
-No.

01:29:17.541 --> 01:29:20.416
About making it about you, not Jesus.
Like Wicks, you said.

01:29:20.500 --> 01:29:22.708
Father, this is important.

01:29:22.791 --> 01:29:24.291
Help me understand!

01:29:24.375 --> 01:29:27.375
We are here to serve the world,
not beat it.

01:29:28.125 --> 01:29:30.333
-That's what Christ did.
-So?

01:29:30.416 --> 01:29:33.250
So when Wicks was talking about
fighting the world for Christ's sake,

01:29:33.333 --> 01:29:36.791
he wasn't talking about Christ,
he was talking about his own ego.

01:29:36.875 --> 01:29:39.708
And power.
He was never talking about Christ.

01:29:41.833 --> 01:29:45.041
Yes, over and over
he talked about Christ rising in power.

01:29:45.125 --> 01:29:47.041
Getting his revenge on the unfaithful.

01:29:47.125 --> 01:29:48.958
Eve's Apple is the treasure.

01:29:49.041 --> 01:29:51.458
"Eve's Apple restored to the tree."

01:29:51.541 --> 01:29:52.875
Now, what does that mean?

01:29:52.958 --> 01:29:55.375
Blanc. I don't know.

01:29:56.291 --> 01:29:57.916
And I don't care.

01:30:03.875 --> 01:30:06.625
That'll be Geraldine
coming for her update on the case.

01:30:06.708 --> 01:30:09.333
Now, Father, you're right.

01:30:09.416 --> 01:30:11.416
This is my game, not yours.

01:30:11.500 --> 01:30:14.708
Why don't you head back to the rectory?
I'll handle her.

01:30:16.291 --> 01:30:17.500
Thank you.

01:30:18.208 --> 01:30:20.333
Make sure the door's shut when you leave.

01:30:23.750 --> 01:30:25.583
Hope you catch your killer, Blanc.

01:30:26.458 --> 01:30:27.833
Thank you. I… I will.

01:30:45.250 --> 01:30:46.666
Father Jud?

01:30:47.333 --> 01:30:49.083
-Father Jud.
-He's not here.

01:30:49.166 --> 01:30:50.166
Come.

01:30:50.666 --> 01:30:53.875
I want you to search those back rooms
and that closet thing too.

01:30:57.250 --> 01:30:58.083
Oh.

01:30:59.166 --> 01:31:00.583
It's good, right?

01:31:00.666 --> 01:31:01.958
Great, actually.

01:31:02.041 --> 01:31:04.375
Especially the part where
Gideon Fell walks you through

01:31:04.458 --> 01:31:06.375
the possible solutions
of a locked-door crime.

01:31:06.458 --> 01:31:07.416
-Mm.
-Yeah.

01:31:07.500 --> 01:31:09.666
You covered three of them,
then you stopped.

01:31:10.291 --> 01:31:12.500
Now, having read the fourth, I know why.

01:31:13.125 --> 01:31:15.208
See, I rewatched the video
and I realized something.

01:31:16.416 --> 01:31:18.625
From the moment Jud enters the closet,

01:31:19.125 --> 01:31:23.291
until the first of the flock
has a line of sight into that closet

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:25.416
is nine seconds.

01:31:25.916 --> 01:31:28.750
Nine seconds alone and unseen.

01:31:29.666 --> 01:31:33.500
Plenty of time to do the deed
with a concealed knife.

01:31:37.166 --> 01:31:39.000
That's how it was done, right?

01:31:39.083 --> 01:31:40.291
No games.

01:31:40.791 --> 01:31:43.416
No bullshit. That's how it was done.

01:31:45.375 --> 01:31:47.041
Yes.

01:31:48.250 --> 01:31:50.875
And you knew. You knew all along
and you toyed with that poor kid

01:31:50.958 --> 01:31:52.583
-like a cat with a mouse.
-No.

01:31:52.666 --> 01:31:55.166
I don't have the whole picture just yet.

01:31:55.250 --> 01:31:57.500
-If you could give me a little more time…
-No.

01:31:57.583 --> 01:31:59.875
-I'm gonna be able to get--
-No!

01:31:59.958 --> 01:32:02.375
I found my killer and I'm bringing him in.

01:32:03.208 --> 01:32:04.416
Where is he?

01:33:40.583 --> 01:33:41.500
Sam!

01:34:58.291 --> 01:34:59.500
Who's there?

01:35:04.833 --> 01:35:06.041
Wait!

01:35:13.625 --> 01:35:14.708
Blanc?

01:35:14.791 --> 01:35:15.875
Here.

01:35:16.541 --> 01:35:19.458
Oh, shit. Who's that?

01:35:19.541 --> 01:35:21.375
The groundskeeper, Samson.

01:35:22.875 --> 01:35:24.708
What the hell happened?

01:35:39.125 --> 01:35:40.250
Oh…

01:35:41.208 --> 01:35:43.708
Mm.

01:35:44.958 --> 01:35:45.791
Uh…

01:35:49.625 --> 01:35:51.583
Mm. Yeah.

01:35:51.666 --> 01:35:52.666
Okay.

01:35:53.208 --> 01:35:56.625
Okay, Wicks was 100% medically dead dead.

01:35:56.708 --> 01:35:59.125
I mean, we know this, I'm just…

01:35:59.625 --> 01:36:01.041
just saying, right?

01:36:02.333 --> 01:36:03.416
Right.

01:36:05.666 --> 01:36:08.875
Okay, then I can also say out loud,

01:36:09.458 --> 01:36:11.875
a man can't just rise from the dead.

01:36:11.958 --> 01:36:14.791
I mean, there's obviously some
Scooby-Doo shit going on here.

01:36:15.291 --> 01:36:16.708
"Scooby-Dooby-Doo."

01:36:16.791 --> 01:36:20.625
Praise to God!
Praise and glory to the Almighty!

01:36:20.708 --> 01:36:22.125
Praise Him!

01:36:22.208 --> 01:36:26.125
Praise God!
Praise and glory to the Almighty.

01:36:26.208 --> 01:36:29.000
-He hath raised His Son.
-Hey, Ritz.

01:36:29.083 --> 01:36:30.500
Set a perimeter on the road.

01:36:30.583 --> 01:36:33.000
News is gonna spread fast
and I don't want any lookie-loos.

01:36:33.083 --> 01:36:34.500
-You got it.
-Chief!

01:36:34.583 --> 01:36:35.416
What?

01:36:35.500 --> 01:36:37.625
That motion-detector light there,
it's also a camera.

01:36:37.708 --> 01:36:39.958
But it's not hooked up to anything.

01:36:40.041 --> 01:36:41.166
A camera, huh?

01:36:41.250 --> 01:36:43.750
I don't know. Maybe it's recording
something on a chip inside.

01:36:43.833 --> 01:36:45.958
Why don't you bring it into the media lab?

01:36:46.625 --> 01:36:48.208
Hallelujah, praise God.

01:36:48.291 --> 01:36:50.708
He has raised up
His servant from the dead.

01:36:50.791 --> 01:36:53.416
Hey, do me a favor? Tape off
this entire area, down to the grove.

01:36:53.500 --> 01:36:54.916
-Got it.
-It's a homicide scene.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:56.791
The groundskeeper is dead.

01:37:08.958 --> 01:37:10.750
No! Please!

01:37:11.791 --> 01:37:14.208
-Oh, shit.
-No! No, no, no!

01:37:14.291 --> 01:37:15.708
Can I get some help?

01:37:15.791 --> 01:37:17.791
-Get help! Martha.
-No! Oh, no, no!

01:37:17.875 --> 01:37:20.083
-Martha, you need to back up.
-Oh, no!

01:37:20.166 --> 01:37:22.541
Martha…

01:37:22.625 --> 01:37:25.666
Flee into the dark, you murderer!

01:37:27.708 --> 01:37:29.333
But he has returned!

01:37:29.833 --> 01:37:33.541
And he brings vengeance! He brings death!

01:37:50.750 --> 01:37:52.166
This is Father Jud.

01:37:52.250 --> 01:37:54.666
Oh, Father Jud, it's Louise.
How you doing?

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:57.291
Uh…

01:37:58.666 --> 01:38:00.291
Yeah… Hi, Louise.

01:38:00.791 --> 01:38:03.208
I… I hope it's not too late,
but you said it was urgent,

01:38:03.291 --> 01:38:04.916
so I just wanted to tell you…

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.625
I spoke to James
and the order for the forklift

01:38:07.708 --> 01:38:10.333
was actually placed by Monsignor Wicks.

01:38:11.208 --> 01:38:15.291
He spoke to James directly about it,
so I do hope that this clears things up.

01:38:15.916 --> 01:38:19.333
Hey, God bless you, Father,
and you have yourself a good night, okay?

01:38:19.416 --> 01:38:22.000
Uh… Yeah.

01:38:22.666 --> 01:38:25.416
Yeah, you too, Louise.

01:38:50.916 --> 01:38:52.125
Jeez.

01:38:53.916 --> 01:38:55.000
Yes?

01:38:56.125 --> 01:38:57.958
Slow down, Martha. What?

01:39:00.750 --> 01:39:02.666
What?

01:39:02.750 --> 01:39:04.583
-It's a miracle.
-Bullshit.

01:39:04.666 --> 01:39:07.083
No, it happened.
Martha said the tomb is empty.

01:39:07.166 --> 01:39:09.375
I'm calling everyone. I'm on my way now.

01:39:15.291 --> 01:39:16.500
Did you, uh…

01:39:17.041 --> 01:39:19.041
What are you doing? You don't smoke.

01:39:19.125 --> 01:39:20.333
I did.

01:39:21.166 --> 01:39:23.000
I smoked for 15 years.

01:39:23.083 --> 01:39:25.000
Did Lee call you? Did he tell you?

01:39:25.500 --> 01:39:26.708
Yep.

01:39:27.958 --> 01:39:30.250
Okay. Well, I'm gonna go
witness a miracle.

01:39:30.333 --> 01:39:33.416
You enjoy your cigarette indoors.

01:40:05.083 --> 01:40:06.291
Praise be.

01:40:07.416 --> 01:40:08.833
It's accomplished.

01:40:10.833 --> 01:40:13.875
Come on.

01:40:15.791 --> 01:40:17.500
Come on, it's…

01:40:18.333 --> 01:40:19.541
He's got it.

01:40:23.041 --> 01:40:26.125
All right, so… it's not great quality…

01:40:26.208 --> 01:40:27.625
-It's fine.
-…but, uh…

01:40:38.458 --> 01:40:39.875
What am I looking at here?

01:40:46.833 --> 01:40:47.833
Okay.

01:40:47.916 --> 01:40:51.375
Um, yeah, so, it records
anytime there's motion

01:40:51.458 --> 01:40:54.875
and this clip is four seconds later.

01:41:07.041 --> 01:41:09.000
Okay?

01:41:09.083 --> 01:41:11.000
Prints from the gardening tool.

01:41:12.291 --> 01:41:15.958
We didn't run the full database check,
just the suspects you questioned.

01:41:16.666 --> 01:41:17.875
It's Father Jud.

01:41:22.750 --> 01:41:23.958
Where is he?

01:41:24.583 --> 01:41:26.416
I sincerely wish I knew.

01:41:46.041 --> 01:41:47.875
Blanc. Blanc!

01:41:48.500 --> 01:41:51.125
I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna… turn myself--

01:41:51.208 --> 01:41:53.208
-…388.
-388, en route.

01:41:53.791 --> 01:41:54.791
433.

01:41:55.625 --> 01:41:57.625
-I'm turning myself in.
-No you are not.

01:41:57.708 --> 01:42:02.000
Skimbleshanks, the railway cat!

01:42:03.166 --> 01:42:05.916
I did it. I killed Samson.
I'm guilty. I have to confess.

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:07.083
-Let me out.
-Listen.

01:42:07.166 --> 01:42:09.583
You're gonna tell me
exactly what happened, but right now,

01:42:09.666 --> 01:42:11.291
how do I get to Dr. Nat's house?

01:42:11.375 --> 01:42:12.875
-Dr. Nat?
-Yes, quickly.

01:42:13.375 --> 01:42:14.583
I regret my stalling.

01:42:14.666 --> 01:42:17.000
I only hope we're not too late.
Now, just get down!

01:42:21.416 --> 01:42:23.541
Hail Mary, full of grace
the Lord is with you.

01:42:23.625 --> 01:42:25.041
Blessed art thou amongst women…

01:42:25.125 --> 01:42:27.291
…sir, that I respect you.
I respect the badge.

01:42:27.375 --> 01:42:30.583
But this is our church and I'm not telling
you that I'm gonna resort to violence,

01:42:30.666 --> 01:42:34.416
but we're gonna stay here all night
if we have to. We are seeing that crypt!

01:42:34.500 --> 01:42:36.500
-Is it real?
-They won't let us in.

01:42:36.583 --> 01:42:39.166
I need to see.

01:42:39.875 --> 01:42:41.791
Please, I need to see.

01:42:59.541 --> 01:43:00.750
Dr. Nat?

01:43:35.625 --> 01:43:37.833
Oh, God.

01:43:38.583 --> 01:43:40.000
What's that smell?

01:43:45.375 --> 01:43:47.000
Just wait here.

01:43:49.041 --> 01:43:50.125
Blanc.

01:43:50.666 --> 01:43:51.750
Yep.

01:43:56.708 --> 01:43:58.125
Oh, God.

01:44:11.333 --> 01:44:12.416
Right.

01:44:14.083 --> 01:44:18.750
Oh, Lord, that is…

01:44:30.166 --> 01:44:31.250
Wicks.

01:44:31.333 --> 01:44:33.500
Yeah, that's… It's him.

01:44:34.375 --> 01:44:35.791
-Is he…
-Yeah.

01:44:36.500 --> 01:44:39.958
I mean, for what it's worth these days.

01:44:42.583 --> 01:44:44.708
Let's see now. Let's…

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:49.250
Okay.

01:44:50.750 --> 01:44:53.083
This might get unpleasant.

01:44:53.166 --> 01:44:54.791
I mean, more unpleasant.

01:45:30.333 --> 01:45:31.416
Dr. Nat.

01:45:32.666 --> 01:45:35.500
In the flesh. Yeah… Or, what's left of it.

01:46:08.500 --> 01:46:10.500
Geraldine, it's… it's Blanc. Um…

01:46:11.625 --> 01:46:13.791
Yeah, he's standing right here.

01:46:13.875 --> 01:46:15.375
Listen to me.

01:46:15.458 --> 01:46:17.625
You're gonna wanna come
to Dr. Nat's house.

01:46:17.708 --> 01:46:21.125
There's a body. Or two.

01:46:22.250 --> 01:46:23.666
It's all here.

01:46:24.166 --> 01:46:27.041
Yes, yeah. It's… it's finished, yeah.

01:46:28.166 --> 01:46:29.666
I'll call you back.

01:46:30.958 --> 01:46:32.791
Father Jud. Wait, wait.

01:46:32.875 --> 01:46:35.000
I killed Samson. I have to do this.

01:46:35.625 --> 01:46:38.250
I have to do it of my own free will
or it won't mean anything.

01:46:53.791 --> 01:46:57.916
Plate check.
Copy that. Any available units to respond…

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.125
Would you call Geraldine for me, please?

01:47:00.625 --> 01:47:03.458
Say Father Jud's returned to his church
and he's ready to confess.

01:47:20.041 --> 01:47:22.750
Father Jud.
I'm here to arrest you for the murder

01:47:22.833 --> 01:47:25.083
of Monsignor Jefferson Wicks
and Samson Holt.

01:47:25.166 --> 01:47:29.333
And you're a person of interest
in the death of Dr. Nathaniel Sharp.

01:47:29.416 --> 01:47:30.833
Nat is dead?

01:47:32.041 --> 01:47:33.333
Murdered in his home.

01:47:34.333 --> 01:47:36.833
We also recovered Wicks' body. It's over.

01:47:37.333 --> 01:47:40.458
Anything you say
can be used against you in a court of law.

01:47:40.541 --> 01:47:43.166
But if you'd like to confess to anything,

01:47:43.250 --> 01:47:46.083
this seems like
a pretty great place to do it.

01:47:48.250 --> 01:47:49.333
Yeah.

01:47:52.375 --> 01:47:54.125
Years ago,

01:47:54.208 --> 01:47:56.625
I murdered a man in a boxing ring.

01:47:58.333 --> 01:48:00.375
I killed him with hate in my heart.

01:48:02.500 --> 01:48:05.916
Last night, that same sin rose in me
and in a moment of

01:48:06.875 --> 01:48:09.041
fear and rage, I--

01:48:13.500 --> 01:48:17.541
I'm sorry, that was dramatic,
but I needed you to stop talking.

01:48:17.625 --> 01:48:19.875
-No. Father Jud--
-I was about to explain to everyone…

01:48:19.958 --> 01:48:21.708
-Sit down and listen.
-Stop talking.

01:48:21.791 --> 01:48:24.750
Please, let him. You were continuing…
Continue, you said last night…

01:48:24.833 --> 01:48:27.166
-In a moment of fear and rage…
-I was about to do it…

01:48:27.250 --> 01:48:30.333
You shall not silence
the voice of the Lord!

01:48:30.416 --> 01:48:35.333
But sit now and behold the wickedness
and shame of the guilty

01:48:35.416 --> 01:48:38.250
laid bare before you all!

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:54.125
What are you doing?

01:48:57.208 --> 01:49:00.416
Let us begin with Wicks' murder.

01:49:00.500 --> 01:49:03.333
Right here on Good Friday.

01:49:04.041 --> 01:49:05.875
The impossible crime.

01:49:07.250 --> 01:49:09.875
And, Geraldine,
you were correct in your deduction.

01:49:09.958 --> 01:49:14.125
When Monsignor Wicks collapsed
in that closet space, he wasn't dead.

01:49:14.208 --> 01:49:16.333
He wasn't even stabbed, not yet.

01:49:17.333 --> 01:49:20.750
The flask he kept stashed
in the breaker box

01:49:20.833 --> 01:49:24.541
was spiked
with a very powerful tranquilizer.

01:49:24.625 --> 01:49:26.416
He drank from it.

01:49:26.500 --> 01:49:28.375
Fortified himself.

01:49:28.458 --> 01:49:31.666
And within minutes,
fell to the floor, unconscious.

01:49:31.750 --> 01:49:34.708
The clanky clunk.

01:49:34.791 --> 01:49:36.625
Leaving him defenseless

01:49:36.708 --> 01:49:40.125
and giving the killer
their chance to enter the closet

01:49:40.708 --> 01:49:42.375
and deliver the deadly blow.

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:44.208
I… I said that already.

01:49:44.791 --> 01:49:45.625
Father Jud.

01:49:45.708 --> 01:49:48.541
No. The knife was in his back
when I found him.

01:49:48.625 --> 01:49:50.208
There's something in his back.

01:49:50.291 --> 01:49:53.333
So how? When? It's impossible. I saw.

01:49:53.416 --> 01:49:54.875
What did you see?

01:49:56.083 --> 01:49:57.500
The red devil head.

01:49:57.583 --> 01:50:00.791
Blood you assumed was Wicks'.

01:50:00.875 --> 01:50:03.125
Now, I showed you
the answer to this, did you see?

01:50:04.375 --> 01:50:05.666
Il Diavolo.

01:50:05.750 --> 01:50:07.333
The pizza bar. The photograph.

01:50:08.666 --> 01:50:10.666
You thought you saw,

01:50:11.208 --> 01:50:13.125
but that wasn't it, no.

01:50:13.208 --> 01:50:15.416
It was a second identical lamp.

01:50:15.500 --> 01:50:18.375
A second identical devil head.

01:50:19.708 --> 01:50:20.791
Yeah.

01:50:23.791 --> 01:50:25.416
And it was also missing.

01:50:26.041 --> 01:50:27.458
Two devils.

01:50:27.541 --> 01:50:28.875
Yes.

01:50:28.958 --> 01:50:30.166
Why two?

01:50:31.041 --> 01:50:32.666
And why painted red?

01:50:32.750 --> 01:50:34.166
It wasn't red though. It's red now.

01:50:34.250 --> 01:50:37.000
The same red as the Good Friday vestments.

01:50:37.083 --> 01:50:38.916
The same exact red

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:42.083
as the mysterious thread
found in the closet.

01:50:42.791 --> 01:50:46.583
Because the second devil head
was there all the time.

01:50:46.666 --> 01:50:49.000
Sewn to the back of his vestments.

01:50:49.083 --> 01:50:50.375
Hollow, light,

01:50:50.458 --> 01:50:52.541
and filled with a small squib of blood

01:50:53.125 --> 01:50:56.041
triggered by an RF remote.

01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:00.208
Set off at the exact right moment.

01:51:00.291 --> 01:51:01.125
Monsignor?

01:51:02.500 --> 01:51:03.375
The doctor.

01:51:05.125 --> 01:51:06.416
A voice of authority

01:51:06.500 --> 01:51:10.041
who can wait for the discovery he needs
before taking charge.

01:51:10.125 --> 01:51:11.333
There's something in his back.

01:51:11.416 --> 01:51:13.041
Wait. Don't touch it.

01:51:15.333 --> 01:51:17.750
A moment of distraction presents itself.

01:51:20.333 --> 01:51:22.333
And the deed is quickly done.

01:51:23.833 --> 01:51:25.083
His final task,

01:51:25.166 --> 01:51:29.500
to remove the incriminating
drug-laced flask.

01:51:29.583 --> 01:51:32.416
But where was it? It was gone.

01:51:33.541 --> 01:51:35.750
The one hiccup in his plan.

01:51:35.833 --> 01:51:39.708
The result of a moment
of foolish grace by Father Jud

01:51:40.291 --> 01:51:44.833
who concealed the flask
to hide Wicks' drinking

01:51:44.916 --> 01:51:47.750
and returned later to retrieve it.

01:51:50.083 --> 01:51:51.291
My God.

01:51:51.791 --> 01:51:52.958
Nat.

01:51:53.041 --> 01:51:54.250
Why?

01:51:54.750 --> 01:51:57.000
Wicks was going to scorch the earth.

01:51:57.083 --> 01:51:58.708
He was going to ruin him.

01:51:58.791 --> 01:52:01.625
No. The bigger why.
The why that brought you here.

01:52:01.708 --> 01:52:04.125
Why do all this insane, elaborate stuff?

01:52:04.208 --> 01:52:07.083
The theatricality? The impossible crime.

01:52:07.166 --> 01:52:08.375
Why?

01:52:09.041 --> 01:52:10.250
Indeed.

01:52:10.333 --> 01:52:12.833
Okay, so… if Dr. Nat killed Wicks,

01:52:13.375 --> 01:52:14.375
who killed Nat?

01:52:14.458 --> 01:52:16.291
Well, now we get to it.

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.750
Not some fiddly locked-door mystery

01:52:19.833 --> 01:52:23.208
with devices and clues,

01:52:23.291 --> 01:52:26.708
but a much, much larger scheme.

01:52:26.791 --> 01:52:31.875
One whose roots
run to the bedrock of this church.

01:52:31.958 --> 01:52:33.708
And one which draws me,

01:52:33.791 --> 01:52:37.041
an unbeliever in every sense of the word,

01:52:37.125 --> 01:52:40.041
into the realm of belief.

01:52:41.666 --> 01:52:43.500
To understand this case,

01:52:44.541 --> 01:52:48.625
I had to look at the myth
that was being constructed.

01:52:48.708 --> 01:52:51.541
Not to solve whether it was real or not,

01:52:51.625 --> 01:52:54.041
but to feel in my soul

01:52:54.125 --> 01:52:57.250
the essence of that
which it strove to convey.

01:53:00.541 --> 01:53:01.958
A holy priest.

01:53:02.708 --> 01:53:08.125
Struck down by no man,
but by the hand of Satan himself.

01:53:08.208 --> 01:53:11.625
Laid to rest
in the sealed tomb of his father,

01:53:12.208 --> 01:53:13.625
but then risen

01:53:14.333 --> 01:53:15.958
by the will of God.

01:53:16.041 --> 01:53:18.041
Risen as something new.

01:53:18.125 --> 01:53:20.125
No longer a fallible man,

01:53:20.208 --> 01:53:24.041
but now a symbol
of the Lord's power over death.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:27.625
His justice for the holy.

01:53:28.125 --> 01:53:30.375
His vengeance for the wicked.

01:53:33.166 --> 01:53:37.000
Okay. And now, what really happened?

01:53:37.083 --> 01:53:39.083
Yes. Yes.

01:53:39.166 --> 01:53:43.000
It is time to break this tawdry facade

01:53:43.083 --> 01:53:47.083
of miracles and resurrections
and reveal what really happened.

01:53:47.166 --> 01:53:49.583
It is time for Benoit Blanc's

01:53:49.666 --> 01:53:52.750
final checkmate
over the mysteries of faith!

01:54:21.291 --> 01:54:23.291
Blanc, are you… Are you okay?

01:54:25.416 --> 01:54:26.625
Damascus.

01:54:27.666 --> 01:54:28.875
Damascus?

01:54:30.250 --> 01:54:33.291
Like… a road to Damascus thing?

01:54:33.375 --> 01:54:35.250
Yes, yes, Damascus.

01:54:38.791 --> 01:54:40.416
Shit.

01:54:41.291 --> 01:54:42.375
Blanc?

01:54:58.916 --> 01:55:00.541
I cannot solve this case.

01:55:04.500 --> 01:55:05.500
What?

01:55:06.583 --> 01:55:09.375
Are you saying that
your conclusion, Benoit Blanc,

01:55:09.458 --> 01:55:12.416
is that Monsignor Wicks
rose from the dead?

01:55:12.500 --> 01:55:13.916
That it was a miracle?

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:18.125
I'm saying I cannot solve this case.

01:55:19.666 --> 01:55:20.750
That works.

01:55:21.250 --> 01:55:22.083
Thank you.

01:55:24.458 --> 01:55:25.541
Blanc?

01:55:26.250 --> 01:55:28.666
If you know what really happened,
you should tell everyone.

01:55:28.750 --> 01:55:32.458
Is this you sparing our faith
or being respectful or something?

01:55:32.541 --> 01:55:34.750
Because we deserve the truth.

01:55:34.833 --> 01:55:36.250
It is not.

01:55:37.625 --> 01:55:39.250
I need the truth.

01:55:40.541 --> 01:55:42.833
Can't you just

01:55:42.916 --> 01:55:45.791
give us the answer?
Isn't that what all this is for?

01:55:48.583 --> 01:55:51.541
And would you consider blurbing my book?

01:55:51.625 --> 01:55:53.333
No.

01:55:53.958 --> 01:55:56.500
Okay. All right.
Show's over. Everyone out.

01:55:57.333 --> 01:55:59.750
Out. Out.

01:56:00.458 --> 01:56:02.166
Yeah, can you stand back, sir?

01:56:03.458 --> 01:56:05.083
Okay, can we keep them back…

01:56:06.750 --> 01:56:09.583
I add another chapter
and then we're… we're ready.

01:56:09.666 --> 01:56:12.000
We're ready to publish. Trust me, Alan.

01:56:12.083 --> 01:56:14.708
Call Random House, everybody.
It's gonna be huge!

01:56:17.833 --> 01:56:21.708
What we've witnessed is a miracle
confirmed by Benoit Blanc himself.

01:56:21.791 --> 01:56:25.125
The world will know
what happened today here at Chimney Rock.

01:56:25.208 --> 01:56:29.208
You can find out yourself.
Follow my YouTube channel @CyDraven…

01:56:29.291 --> 01:56:30.500
What a mess.

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.416
I assume they'll arrest Father Jud now.

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:36.083
Yes.

01:56:37.041 --> 01:56:38.666
I suppose they will.

01:56:44.833 --> 01:56:46.333
What the hell was that?

01:56:46.875 --> 01:56:48.875
Road to Damascus.

01:56:49.583 --> 01:56:52.000
Scales fell from my eyes.

01:56:52.083 --> 01:56:53.916
So what? Facts, schmacks?

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.541
You believe in God
and all this mishegoss is real?

01:56:56.625 --> 01:56:58.458
No, no. God is a fiction.

01:56:58.541 --> 01:57:00.541
My revelation came from…

01:57:01.625 --> 01:57:03.041
from Father Jud.

01:57:04.500 --> 01:57:06.916
His example to have grace.

01:57:09.583 --> 01:57:11.416
Grace for my enemy.

01:57:15.166 --> 01:57:16.541
Grace for the broken.

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:20.625
Grace for those who

01:57:21.416 --> 01:57:22.541
deserve it the least.

01:57:24.625 --> 01:57:26.041
But who need it the most.

01:57:31.291 --> 01:57:32.500
For the guilty.

01:57:33.083 --> 01:57:34.166
Mr. Blanc.

01:57:34.833 --> 01:57:36.458
You know the truth.

01:57:37.041 --> 01:57:39.041
I do, yes.

01:57:40.583 --> 01:57:43.916
And you made yourself the fool just now.

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.625
So that you could do this
of your own free will.

01:57:47.916 --> 01:57:50.416
And now you better do it. Quickly.

01:57:50.500 --> 01:57:51.708
Thank you.

01:57:55.583 --> 01:57:57.000
Father Jud.

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:05.125
What do I do?

01:58:05.208 --> 01:58:07.041
What you were born to do.

01:58:07.125 --> 01:58:08.541
Be her priest.

01:58:09.041 --> 01:58:10.458
Take her confession.

01:58:19.125 --> 01:58:21.125
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

01:58:21.208 --> 01:58:23.416
It is a week since my last confession.

01:58:27.916 --> 01:58:32.750
I told myself it started with pure intent.

01:58:34.125 --> 01:58:35.541
But the truth is

01:58:36.375 --> 01:58:39.458
it started with a lie.

01:58:40.416 --> 01:58:41.500
Prentice.

01:58:43.041 --> 01:58:43.958
Prentice.

01:58:45.625 --> 01:58:48.625
I saw him take his final communion.

01:58:52.500 --> 01:58:54.625
This is Eve's Apple, Martha.

01:58:55.208 --> 01:58:57.416
My entire cursed fortune.

01:58:57.916 --> 01:59:00.333
All the sin in the world.

01:59:00.416 --> 01:59:02.333
All that Eve hungers for.

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:04.625
I have trapped it.

01:59:05.208 --> 01:59:08.625
It shall never again
be plucked by evil hands.

01:59:09.416 --> 01:59:11.333
The body of Christ.

01:59:24.458 --> 01:59:27.875
He took the jewel to his grave.

01:59:30.625 --> 01:59:35.291
I swore that I would
protect this great secret.

01:59:36.708 --> 01:59:40.625
But Grace, she discovered that
he had bought the diamond.

01:59:40.708 --> 01:59:42.000
I don't know how.

01:59:42.083 --> 01:59:43.916
She knew her fancy brands.

01:59:45.166 --> 01:59:48.500
What would come
in a custom-made Fabergé box,

01:59:48.583 --> 01:59:50.750
itself worth maybe $20,000?

01:59:50.833 --> 01:59:54.916
Not a trinket or a plastic Jesus, no.

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.166
Something facet-cut, worth a fortune.

01:59:58.250 --> 01:59:59.333
A jewel.

01:59:59.416 --> 02:00:02.125
But she didn't know where he hid it.

02:00:02.208 --> 02:00:03.708
So that night…

02:00:06.166 --> 02:00:08.291
She didn't desecrate the church in anger.

02:00:08.875 --> 02:00:11.916
No, she was looking for the hidden jewel.

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:15.500
A dark life of desperation.

02:00:16.041 --> 02:00:19.125
A prisoner to shame and judgment.

02:00:19.625 --> 02:00:21.625
It was her one way out.

02:00:22.625 --> 02:00:24.041
That poor girl.

02:00:25.583 --> 02:00:27.416
Martha, what did you say to her?

02:00:29.541 --> 02:00:31.375
I know where he hid it.

02:00:31.458 --> 02:00:33.500
And you'll never find it.

02:00:33.583 --> 02:00:35.000
You harlot whore.

02:00:40.208 --> 02:00:42.125
Where is it?

02:00:44.833 --> 02:00:47.208
Where is it, you little shit?

02:00:48.208 --> 02:00:51.291
I kept the secret of Eve's Apple

02:00:51.375 --> 02:00:55.958
locked in my heart for 60 years.

02:00:57.125 --> 02:00:59.750
My terrible burden.

02:01:00.958 --> 02:01:01.833
Until…

02:01:01.916 --> 02:01:03.166
Until…

02:01:05.166 --> 02:01:07.250
I challenged you to confess it.

02:01:07.333 --> 02:01:10.708
With defiant pride,

02:01:11.750 --> 02:01:13.166
I confessed.

02:01:16.750 --> 02:01:18.375
To the wrong priest.

02:01:22.583 --> 02:01:24.625
Time is of the essence now.

02:01:24.708 --> 02:01:26.708
Last Sunday, in the rectory,

02:01:26.791 --> 02:01:29.958
Vera confronted Wicks
and you learned about Cy.

02:01:30.041 --> 02:01:33.000
I could accept that he had strayed.

02:01:33.083 --> 02:01:36.791
But as he spoke, something became clear.

02:01:37.708 --> 02:01:39.916
This was something much bigger.

02:01:40.416 --> 02:01:44.833
He was embracing that terrible boy.

02:01:46.541 --> 02:01:48.666
That's when I suspected.

02:01:48.750 --> 02:01:51.125
So you call the construction company.

02:01:51.208 --> 02:01:52.625
Thank you, James.

02:01:54.875 --> 02:01:56.083
And I was certain.

02:01:57.000 --> 02:02:00.416
He had ordered the equipment
to open the crypt

02:02:00.500 --> 02:02:06.333
to steal the diamond
for his own greed and lust for power.

02:02:06.416 --> 02:02:10.875
The corrupting sin
of Eve's Apple would be unearthed

02:02:11.541 --> 02:02:13.958
and this church would fall

02:02:14.041 --> 02:02:18.666
because of everything
Prentice had warned me about.

02:02:18.750 --> 02:02:20.166
I had failed him.

02:02:22.750 --> 02:02:23.958
All my life,

02:02:24.583 --> 02:02:27.916
I was not the bad one. I was the good one.

02:02:28.500 --> 02:02:30.083
The faithful one.

02:02:30.166 --> 02:02:32.791
Serving and protecting the church.

02:02:33.416 --> 02:02:36.500
If I failed in that, what is my life?

02:02:36.583 --> 02:02:37.666
I understand.

02:02:37.750 --> 02:02:40.375
My sole purpose

02:02:40.458 --> 02:02:41.875
and I failed.

02:02:42.958 --> 02:02:44.166
Unless…

02:02:48.166 --> 02:02:49.125
Unless…

02:02:51.833 --> 02:02:55.583
Unless I could…
I could steal the jewel first

02:02:55.666 --> 02:02:57.416
and get rid of it forever.

02:02:58.416 --> 02:02:59.833
And with the same stroke,

02:02:59.916 --> 02:03:04.166
raise Wicks up
as a miraculous risen saint.

02:03:04.250 --> 02:03:07.666
Not a fallible man, but a symbol

02:03:08.500 --> 02:03:10.500
that would save my church.

02:03:11.666 --> 02:03:14.208
All it would take is a miracle.

02:03:15.583 --> 02:03:17.416
So I formed my plan.

02:03:18.416 --> 02:03:22.500
Wicks' death must be a holy mystery.

02:03:23.291 --> 02:03:26.375
Unsolvable and divine.

02:03:27.375 --> 02:03:29.125
But you couldn't do it alone.

02:03:29.833 --> 02:03:30.916
No.

02:03:32.458 --> 02:03:34.083
A weak man, I thought.

02:03:34.666 --> 02:03:35.875
Desperate.

02:03:35.958 --> 02:03:38.708
Someone who would fall in line
to save the church

02:03:38.791 --> 02:03:41.375
and stay in line to cover his shame.

02:03:41.958 --> 02:03:45.916
And who had access
to medical-grade tranquilizers.

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.041
Yes. And that.

02:03:51.458 --> 02:03:54.416
It all went according to plan.

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.083
Oh, God.

02:03:58.166 --> 02:03:59.250
My vanity.

02:03:59.333 --> 02:04:00.750
So wicked.

02:04:01.291 --> 02:04:02.416
Martha.

02:04:03.041 --> 02:04:05.500
I understand, I promise, I do.

02:04:06.083 --> 02:04:07.916
Keep going. I'm here.

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.375
I didn't reckon the cost.

02:04:11.458 --> 02:04:13.291
Forgive me, Samson.

02:04:13.833 --> 02:04:16.250
Strong Samson, faithful Samson.

02:04:16.333 --> 02:04:18.875
Samson. Who made the coffins.

02:04:21.541 --> 02:04:23.833
Shit.

02:04:24.625 --> 02:04:26.041
You will rise again.

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:28.833
It will be okay.

02:04:28.916 --> 02:04:30.541
You will rise again.

02:04:31.125 --> 02:04:33.375
It will be okay.

02:04:35.416 --> 02:04:36.625
I promise.

02:04:37.333 --> 02:04:40.541
He didn't understand why we were doing it.

02:04:40.625 --> 02:04:43.458
Anything for you, my angel.

02:04:44.208 --> 02:04:45.375
But he trusted me.

02:04:45.875 --> 02:04:47.708
Because he loved me.

02:04:48.375 --> 02:04:50.500
Oh, Lord.

02:04:55.250 --> 02:04:57.083
How did it go so wrong?

02:04:59.750 --> 02:05:01.750
It was supposed to be so simple.

02:05:01.833 --> 02:05:03.791
The doctor gives the signal.

02:05:16.208 --> 02:05:18.625
Samson retrieves the jewel.

02:05:19.875 --> 02:05:22.708
The Lazarus door serves its purpose.

02:05:26.875 --> 02:05:30.166
All caught on camera the way we planned.

02:05:30.791 --> 02:05:33.583
Dr. Nat would drive off
with Wicks' body in his truck

02:05:34.500 --> 02:05:37.833
and dispose of it
in that nasty gook in his cellar.

02:05:37.916 --> 02:05:42.000
And the next day, Samson would
tell the tale of the risen saint

02:05:42.083 --> 02:05:46.083
and his word of blessing
to his faithful groundskeeper

02:05:46.166 --> 02:05:49.000
before ascending back into heaven.

02:05:49.666 --> 02:05:51.083
A miracle.

02:05:51.666 --> 02:05:53.500
It would have been perfect.

02:05:55.416 --> 02:05:57.541
I wasn't supposed to be there.

02:05:57.625 --> 02:05:59.666
You most certainly were not.

02:06:00.458 --> 02:06:01.541
Did you know

02:06:01.625 --> 02:06:04.708
what had happened
when you found Samson's body?

02:06:04.791 --> 02:06:06.500
I had an idea.

02:06:06.583 --> 02:06:08.583
No, no!

02:06:09.250 --> 02:06:11.083
But I had to be sure.

02:06:14.541 --> 02:06:15.750
Praise be.

02:06:16.250 --> 02:06:17.458
It's accomplished.

02:06:35.958 --> 02:06:39.291
Oh. Oh. Oh.

02:06:42.208 --> 02:06:44.208
Then he told me the fairy tale

02:06:44.291 --> 02:06:47.291
of how everything
had gone according to plan.

02:06:48.750 --> 02:06:52.208
It was only then that I told him
I'd been to the crypt.

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.666
And I knew he was lying.

02:06:58.416 --> 02:07:00.541
And then he told me the truth.

02:07:05.333 --> 02:07:07.750
Shit. We can't let him see us.

02:07:16.333 --> 02:07:17.541
Jesus.

02:07:20.541 --> 02:07:22.166
My second mistake.

02:07:22.666 --> 02:07:27.291
Underestimating the temptation
of Eve's Apple.

02:07:28.541 --> 02:07:33.000
Our agreed mission was to destroy it
or throw it in the sea.

02:07:33.083 --> 02:07:37.500
But all this power will I give thee.

02:07:38.416 --> 02:07:41.541
Christ himself could resist temptation,

02:07:41.625 --> 02:07:44.833
but this desperate little man,

02:07:45.333 --> 02:07:48.541
all that stood in his way
was Samson and I.

02:07:49.375 --> 02:07:51.375
Now, here was his opportunity.

02:07:52.250 --> 02:07:55.500
To remove his obstacles.

02:07:56.583 --> 02:08:00.583
Frame a young priest with a violent past

02:08:00.666 --> 02:08:02.500
and keep the jewel.

02:08:04.458 --> 02:08:05.291
He took it.

02:08:09.833 --> 02:08:13.791
Then all that remained in his way was me.

02:08:14.791 --> 02:08:19.291
He had poisoned my coffee
with a lethal dose of pentobarbital.

02:08:20.208 --> 02:08:22.833
No remedy once ingested.

02:08:23.583 --> 02:08:24.916
Mm, painless.

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.833
A little numbness in the lips.

02:08:28.500 --> 02:08:31.583
Then in ten minutes,
time for your final prayer.

02:08:32.416 --> 02:08:35.666
Then he begged me to understand
why he was doing all this.

02:08:35.750 --> 02:08:39.208
That the money would lure back
his harpy wife,

02:08:39.291 --> 02:08:41.125
blah, blah, blah.

02:08:41.833 --> 02:08:44.083
I told him I understood.

02:08:45.416 --> 02:08:47.416
I understood why he did it.

02:08:48.708 --> 02:08:49.791
Oh.

02:08:51.875 --> 02:08:54.500
I had understood it all.

02:09:14.708 --> 02:09:16.708
These things I did with

02:09:17.458 --> 02:09:20.083
hatred in my heart.

02:09:25.166 --> 02:09:27.583
Vengeance is mine, said the Lord.

02:09:33.125 --> 02:09:36.625
And that is the story
the crime scene will tell the world, but…

02:09:39.583 --> 02:09:41.416
…inside my heart,

02:09:42.166 --> 02:09:43.375
I know.

02:09:47.458 --> 02:09:49.083
Vengeance is mine.

02:09:52.916 --> 02:09:56.500
These sins I confess to you, Father.

02:09:56.583 --> 02:09:59.791
I have lied, I have killed,

02:10:00.500 --> 02:10:01.708
and now

02:10:02.708 --> 02:10:05.333
I have topped it all off
with a real doozy.

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:14.625
Father. Quickly now, quickly.

02:10:14.708 --> 02:10:16.000
What's happening?

02:10:16.083 --> 02:10:18.125
I knew when I saw her lips…

02:10:20.166 --> 02:10:21.875
it was already too late.

02:10:23.708 --> 02:10:25.708
She's taken the pentobarbital.

02:10:25.791 --> 02:10:28.708
-Oh. Oh, God. Call the ambulance now!
-On it!

02:10:28.791 --> 02:10:31.208
There might be a poison kit
in the prowler!

02:10:42.708 --> 02:10:44.333
Forgive me, Father,

02:10:45.541 --> 02:10:46.958
for all you have endured.

02:10:48.625 --> 02:10:53.458
Forgive me, Lord, for…
for Wicks and Nat and…

02:10:55.666 --> 02:10:56.875
Samson.

02:10:57.500 --> 02:10:59.125
My sweet Samson.

02:11:00.208 --> 02:11:01.416
And Grace.

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.083
Martha.

02:11:08.833 --> 02:11:10.041
Grace.

02:11:12.625 --> 02:11:13.833
You're safe now.

02:11:16.666 --> 02:11:17.875
Let it go.

02:11:19.458 --> 02:11:21.083
Let the hatred go.

02:11:26.458 --> 02:11:27.541
Grace.

02:11:31.208 --> 02:11:32.333
Yes.

02:11:33.208 --> 02:11:34.625
I see it now.

02:11:36.541 --> 02:11:38.166
That poor girl.

02:11:41.333 --> 02:11:43.166
Forgive me, Grace.

02:11:47.375 --> 02:11:48.583
Father…

02:11:51.583 --> 02:11:53.208
you're really good at this.

02:11:58.708 --> 02:12:00.875
God, the father of mercies,

02:12:01.625 --> 02:12:04.125
through the death
and resurrection of His Son

02:12:04.208 --> 02:12:06.833
has reconciled the world to Himself

02:12:07.583 --> 02:12:11.750
and poured out the Holy Spirit
for the forgiveness of sins,

02:12:12.583 --> 02:12:14.500
and through the ministry of the Church,

02:12:14.583 --> 02:12:17.000
may God grant you pardon and peace,

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.208
and I absolve you of your sins.

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:31.208
In the name of the Father and of the Son

02:12:32.291 --> 02:12:33.708
and the Holy Spirit.

02:12:49.416 --> 02:12:50.500
Shit.

02:13:20.041 --> 02:13:21.875
The jewel was never found.

02:13:26.125 --> 02:13:27.625
The church closed for a while.

02:13:28.541 --> 02:13:31.708
The flock,
what was left of them, scattered.

02:13:32.291 --> 02:13:37.833
Some got what they wanted only to discover
the one thing every holy man knows…

02:13:42.208 --> 02:13:43.833
God has a sense of humor.

02:13:49.375 --> 02:13:51.791
And some got a fresh start.

02:13:52.458 --> 02:13:55.291
Maybe to find a path
that's theirs, I hope so.

02:13:59.041 --> 02:14:00.666
And some got their miracle.

02:14:01.958 --> 02:14:04.375
Not being cured or fixed,

02:14:05.041 --> 02:14:08.125
but finding the sustaining power
to wake up every day

02:14:08.208 --> 02:14:10.333
and do what we're here to do

02:14:11.208 --> 02:14:12.833
in spite of the pain.

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:15.208
Daily bread.

02:14:22.541 --> 02:14:24.541
And that's what I pray for with you.

02:14:25.416 --> 02:14:27.416
That you find what you're looking for.

02:14:30.708 --> 02:14:33.333
-Where is it? You know.
-No! Cy, Cy!

02:14:33.416 --> 02:14:35.166
Goddamn it, I know you both know.

02:14:35.250 --> 02:14:37.666
This is your last chance
or we're gonna drag you into court.

02:14:37.750 --> 02:14:39.500
Mr. Wicks, control yourself.

02:14:39.583 --> 02:14:42.208
We'd hoped this mediation
would resolve this matter.

02:14:42.291 --> 02:14:44.291
She gave it to them
and they're hiding it. I know.

02:14:44.375 --> 02:14:47.541
We've allowed your representatives to
search the church and rectory thoroughly.

02:14:47.625 --> 02:14:49.250
They found nothing.

02:14:49.333 --> 02:14:51.750
Also, Mr. Blanc was there
when Martha passed

02:14:51.833 --> 02:14:53.833
and he denies anything untoward.

02:14:55.416 --> 02:14:58.250
Hey.

02:14:58.750 --> 02:14:59.833
Hey!

02:15:00.416 --> 02:15:03.291
Any hint you've sold it, any big
charity donations, you fix the roof,

02:15:03.375 --> 02:15:06.375
you upgrade your shitty communion wine,
I will watch,

02:15:06.458 --> 02:15:08.708
I will audit, I will find out.

02:15:09.541 --> 02:15:11.958
I hope you come back
to the church someday, Cy.

02:15:12.500 --> 02:15:14.625
Your real inheritance is in Christ.

02:15:25.583 --> 02:15:28.208
Little punk bitch.

02:15:32.375 --> 02:15:34.500
His video with you is still trending.

02:15:34.583 --> 02:15:35.666
Yes.

02:15:35.750 --> 02:15:37.958
"Benoit Blanc 'pwned'."

02:15:38.041 --> 02:15:40.875
Owned with a "P". Whatever that means.

02:15:41.500 --> 02:15:43.416
We keep pushing the facts out there.

02:15:43.500 --> 02:15:46.875
Martha, what really happened.
But it doesn't seem to matter.

02:15:47.458 --> 02:15:51.291
Wicks truthers keep flooding our Facebook.
It's an outhouse fire.

02:15:52.625 --> 02:15:54.458
Such a time to be alive.

02:15:55.416 --> 02:15:58.041
You're gonna be
very popular once you open.

02:15:58.750 --> 02:16:00.333
Maybe not in a good way.

02:16:00.416 --> 02:16:01.916
Are you ready to take that on?

02:16:03.708 --> 02:16:04.791
Let 'em come.

02:16:07.375 --> 02:16:08.458
Good luck, kid.

02:16:11.791 --> 02:16:13.958
Listen, uh… Um…

02:16:14.458 --> 02:16:16.833
I'm… I'm… I'm gonna go.

02:16:22.250 --> 02:16:23.875
Hmm.

02:16:26.750 --> 02:16:31.000
Uh, my first Mass is coming up if…
if you wanna stick around.

02:16:31.083 --> 02:16:33.000
Um… That's so nice of you.

02:16:33.083 --> 02:16:37.250
There is, uh…
nothing I would rather not do.

02:16:37.333 --> 02:16:38.541
Toodle-oo.

02:16:49.458 --> 02:16:54.208
Well, the moon is broken
And the sky is cracked

02:16:55.583 --> 02:16:58.958
Come on up to the house

02:17:00.041 --> 02:17:04.916
The only things that you can see
Is all that you lack

02:17:05.500 --> 02:17:06.708
Welcome!

02:17:06.791 --> 02:17:09.750
Come on up to the house

02:17:11.500 --> 02:17:16.041
All your crying don't do no good

02:17:17.041 --> 02:17:20.375
Come on up to the house

02:17:21.458 --> 02:17:26.875
Come down off the cross
We can use the wood

02:17:26.958 --> 02:17:30.958
You gotta come on up to the house

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:36.625
Come on up to the house

02:17:38.250 --> 02:17:41.625
Come on up to the house

02:17:42.500 --> 02:17:47.833
The world is not my home
I'm just a-passing through

02:17:47.916 --> 02:17:52.958
You got to come on up to the house

02:17:58.750 --> 02:18:04.416
There's no light in the tunnel
No irons in the fire

02:18:05.125 --> 02:18:08.875
Come on up to the house

02:18:09.541 --> 02:18:14.833
And you're singing lead soprano
In a junkman's choir

02:18:14.916 --> 02:18:19.583
You got to come on up to the house

02:18:20.500 --> 02:18:25.625
Does life seem nasty
Brutish and short

02:18:26.416 --> 02:18:30.125
Come on up to the house

02:18:30.791 --> 02:18:35.833
The seas are stormy
And you can't find no port

02:18:35.916 --> 02:18:41.375
Got to come on up to the house, yeah

02:18:41.458 --> 02:18:45.833
You gotta come on up to the house

02:18:47.708 --> 02:18:51.250
Come on up to the house

02:18:52.166 --> 02:18:57.333
The world is not my home
I'm just a-passing through

02:18:57.416 --> 02:19:02.500
You got to come on up
To the house, yeah

02:19:24.416 --> 02:19:28.833
You gotta come on up to the house

02:19:30.750 --> 02:19:34.125
Come on up to the house

02:19:35.125 --> 02:19:40.333
The world is not my home
I'm just a-passing through

02:19:40.416 --> 02:19:44.750
You got to come on up to the house

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:50.916
There's nothing in the world
That you can do

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:55.333
You gotta come on up to the house

02:19:56.375 --> 02:20:01.875
And you been whipped by the forces
That are inside you

02:20:01.958 --> 02:20:06.125
Gotta come on up to the house

02:20:07.208 --> 02:20:12.500
Well, you're high on top
Of your mountain of woe

02:20:12.583 --> 02:20:16.666
Gotta come on up to the house

02:20:17.666 --> 02:20:23.041
Well, you know you should surrender
But you can't let it go

02:20:23.125 --> 02:20:27.875
You gotta come on up
To the house, yeah

02:20:28.583 --> 02:20:32.791
Gotta come on up to the house

02:20:33.875 --> 02:20:38.208
Gotta come on up to the house

02:20:38.958 --> 02:20:44.333
The world is not my home
I'm just a-passing through

02:20:44.416 --> 02:20:49.000
You gotta come on up to the house

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:54.500
Gotta come on up to the house

02:20:55.083 --> 02:21:01.708
You gotta come on up to the house

02:21:02.333 --> 02:21:08.750
Oh, yeah
