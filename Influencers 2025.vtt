03:45.486 --> 03:46.400
She's back.

03:46.443 --> 03:47.401
Heya.

04:02.677 --> 04:05.375
Georgie was asking for you.

04:05.462 --> 04:08.900
I told him you hated him and
that you despised his baking.

04:11.686 --> 04:12.774
You bitch.

04:28.529 --> 04:29.530
You wouldn't like my family.

04:37.494 --> 04:39.496
I'm excited for this weekend.

04:39.583 --> 04:40.889
We could have just
done something here.

04:41.019 --> 04:42.412
Well, I wanted to.

04:42.456 --> 04:44.806
I want this weekend
to be special.

04:44.936 --> 04:45.937
It's a big deal.

04:48.549 --> 04:49.463
I guess.

04:52.509 --> 04:53.989
It's just too much.

04:54.076 --> 04:55.251
Well, I keep saying I
can help pay for things.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.700
Where'd you get that?

05:09.787 --> 05:10.919
I rented it.

05:12.964 --> 05:15.663
It's a weekend, not a month.

05:46.171 --> 05:48.565
Oh, wow.

05:48.696 --> 05:50.611
Let's pull over.

05:50.698 --> 05:51.916
We're already an hour behind

05:51.960 --> 05:52.917
Oh, come on.

05:52.961 --> 05:54.005
It'll be quick.

05:54.049 --> 05:55.442
I love this kind of stuff.

06:28.126 --> 06:29.084
Let's go upstairs.

06:33.393 --> 06:34.394
Come on!

06:49.713 --> 06:50.497
Step back from there.

06:50.627 --> 06:51.759
It's dangerous.

06:51.846 --> 06:53.325
It's fine.

06:53.413 --> 06:54.936
Diane.

06:55.023 --> 06:56.024
It's fine.

07:01.029 --> 07:02.117
Stand there.

07:44.333 --> 07:46.553
We booked the corner
top room suite, though.

07:46.640 --> 07:47.771
I'm confused.

07:47.858 --> 07:49.425
My apologies.

07:49.556 --> 07:50.992
We've had a bit of a reshuffle
with a special guest who

07:51.122 --> 07:52.210
just showed up last minute.

07:52.254 --> 07:53.690
- A special guest?
- Yes.

07:53.777 --> 07:54.735
How do I say it?

07:54.778 --> 07:56.432
A marketing deal.

07:56.519 --> 07:58.086
Our dates got moved
around, and my apologies.

07:58.173 --> 08:00.436
I spent extra on that
room specifically.

08:00.523 --> 08:02.307
We've been planning
this trip for months.

08:02.438 --> 08:03.744
Again, we are very sorry.

08:07.269 --> 08:08.879
All good?

08:08.966 --> 08:10.011
Not really.

08:12.361 --> 08:14.885
It's tiny.

08:15.016 --> 08:16.017
It's fine.

08:24.852 --> 08:27.376
I am just excited to spend
some time off with you.

08:43.305 --> 08:46.003
Slightly boring
at this point.

08:46.134 --> 08:47.788
Do you get what-- no.

08:47.831 --> 08:50.617
No, I told him that we needed
the flight on Thursday,

08:50.660 --> 08:52.053
not Friday.

08:52.183 --> 08:54.142
He is utterly incompetent,
and this place

08:54.272 --> 08:55.970
is nothing like they said.

08:56.100 --> 08:57.449
I don't know what they're
expecting me to do with it.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.930
It's in the middle of nowhere.

09:00.061 --> 09:01.628
No, I know.

09:01.758 --> 09:05.501
But, oh, the room is not
what they sold me on.

09:05.588 --> 09:08.460
It is so small.

09:08.504 --> 09:09.505
I'll be fine.

09:09.592 --> 09:10.550
I'll figure it out.

09:10.680 --> 09:11.768
It's just a couple of days.

09:12.856 --> 09:14.205
Yeah.

09:14.249 --> 09:15.250
I'll speak to you soon.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.003
The pool is kind
of small, isn't it?

09:29.090 --> 09:31.614
It looked bigger
in the pictures.

09:31.658 --> 09:34.617
I don't know what
I'm gonna do with it.

09:34.704 --> 09:35.749
Charlotte, by the way.

09:35.879 --> 09:36.924
Hmm?

09:39.579 --> 09:41.581
I wasn't originally
gonna come,

09:41.624 --> 09:44.148
but then they ended up comping
the whole thing last minute.

09:44.192 --> 09:47.412
And I have, like,
a deal with the chain,

09:47.543 --> 09:49.458
so I'm sort of forced to come.

09:51.852 --> 09:53.462
The pool looks
bigger in their photos.

09:53.549 --> 09:56.073
Why not just make it look
bigger in your photos?

09:59.207 --> 10:01.513
What's your name?

10:01.557 --> 10:04.429
Catherine.

10:04.516 --> 10:08.303
Well, lovely to meet you.

11:00.224 --> 11:02.444
She feels bad.

11:02.487 --> 11:04.533
I highly doubt that.

11:04.664 --> 11:05.926
You should have seen
how she was talking

11:05.969 --> 11:08.711
to her assistant or whoever.

11:08.798 --> 11:11.671
She even offered
to swap rooms.

11:11.758 --> 11:12.933
Try taking her up on it.

11:16.501 --> 11:19.940
Look, she wants
to buy us dinner.

11:20.070 --> 11:22.203
If you don't want to go,
it's fine, but I'm going.

11:30.733 --> 11:32.430
Honestly, I was bouncing
back and forth between LA

11:32.561 --> 11:34.911
and New York doing
makeup sponsorships.

11:34.955 --> 11:36.913
Basically, selling
products to little girls.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.872
And then I got
pulled back to Europe

11:38.959 --> 11:40.525
for these travel campaigns, and
now I'm ready for something

11:40.612 --> 11:42.223
new again.

11:42.310 --> 11:43.790
You don't get lonely
traveling all alone?

11:43.877 --> 11:44.878
No.

11:45.008 --> 11:46.967
I am constantly meeting people.

11:47.097 --> 11:49.970
And plenty of creators are
solo travelers, so you get

11:50.057 --> 11:51.188
to know people along the way.

11:51.319 --> 11:53.147
I don't know
if I could do it.

11:53.234 --> 11:55.018
I feel like I'd feel unsafe
traveling by myself like that.

11:55.062 --> 11:56.846
Yeah, it seems risky.

11:56.890 --> 11:58.761
Nobody really knows
where you are.

11:58.892 --> 12:01.633
Well, what's life
without a little risk?

12:01.721 --> 12:03.287
You've traveled solo before.

12:03.374 --> 12:04.375
Not really.

12:04.462 --> 12:06.290
Only Europe.

12:06.377 --> 12:09.076
When the two of us met, she
seemed so down on herself,

12:09.206 --> 12:10.817
didn't seem to know anyone.

12:10.947 --> 12:16.213
And then she just came
and swept me off of my feet.

12:16.257 --> 12:17.649
You two are together?

12:17.737 --> 12:19.521
Oh my god!

12:19.564 --> 12:25.005
I thought you
were sisters or something.

12:25.135 --> 12:26.049
Sisters.

12:26.180 --> 12:28.965
Oh, this is so cute.

12:29.052 --> 12:30.793
I mean, this is
actually our anniversary.

12:30.880 --> 12:32.099
A whole year.

12:32.186 --> 12:33.796
Oh my god.

12:33.883 --> 12:34.841
And I'm here, just, like,
ruining the whole thing.

12:36.016 --> 12:38.105
No, that's okay.

12:38.235 --> 12:40.411
So what have you got planned?

12:40.542 --> 12:43.327
Yeah, we're thinking of going
out to the countrysides,

12:43.414 --> 12:45.155
maybe see a vineyard.

12:45.286 --> 12:49.029
Oh, I actually have
this exclusive wine

12:49.116 --> 12:50.944
tour happening tomorrow.

12:51.031 --> 12:52.119
Sponsor thing.

12:52.162 --> 12:53.816
I could get you guys an invite.

12:53.903 --> 12:54.904
We have our own plans.

13:00.605 --> 13:03.434
So how long have
you been in France?

13:06.089 --> 13:07.264
Me?

13:07.308 --> 13:08.309
Yeah.

13:08.396 --> 13:10.137
You're American, no?

13:10.224 --> 13:13.183
Yeah, but I've been in Europe
for a number of years.

13:13.270 --> 13:15.098
America is so new.

13:15.229 --> 13:17.884
There's something about modern
cities that just speaks to me.

13:17.971 --> 13:19.189
Greener grass, I guess.

13:19.276 --> 13:20.277
Totally.

13:20.364 --> 13:21.583
So much more lush.

13:21.670 --> 13:23.541
I just got back from
Japan, and I got

13:23.585 --> 13:25.239
the most beautiful pictures.

13:25.369 --> 13:27.632
Oh, Catherine's always
wanted to go see Asia.

13:27.719 --> 13:29.852
We think we might
try to go next year.

13:29.939 --> 13:30.897
You've never been?

13:30.984 --> 13:31.941
No.

13:31.985 --> 13:33.377
Bucket list, I guess.

13:33.464 --> 13:35.684
I mean, you're always
talking about it.

13:35.815 --> 13:38.774
Well, everyone's
gotta start somewhere.

13:38.861 --> 13:41.603
I'm actually thinking about
going back to Bali once Europe

13:41.733 --> 13:43.126
inevitably bores me.

13:43.170 --> 13:45.215
I've got some
friends in Thailand,

13:45.259 --> 13:49.524
and I'm definitely
so jealous.

13:54.398 --> 13:56.226
She's nice.

13:56.357 --> 13:58.402
Sure.

13:58.446 --> 13:59.403
She means well.

13:59.447 --> 14:01.666
I don't mind her.

14:01.753 --> 14:04.017
She apparently helps
run this charity.

14:04.104 --> 14:06.062
It's just the entitlement.

14:06.149 --> 14:08.282
Girls like that
just take and take.

14:08.369 --> 14:09.936
But if you take
their phones away,

14:09.979 --> 14:12.982
they'd be completely
useless, dead in a week.

14:13.113 --> 14:14.766
Are you jealous?

14:14.854 --> 14:15.898
What?

14:15.985 --> 14:17.813
No.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.467
I just think girls like that
are single-handedly ruining

14:19.554 --> 14:21.295
the next generation of women.

14:21.382 --> 14:23.906
Someone should
teach them a lesson.

14:23.950 --> 14:25.560
A little isolation
without their phones

14:25.647 --> 14:26.996
would probably do them good.

14:27.040 --> 14:28.606
Always so dramatic.

14:28.693 --> 14:30.957
When I was a kid, I
spent a lot of time alone.

14:31.000 --> 14:31.958
Did me good.

14:32.045 --> 14:33.437
What?

14:33.568 --> 14:35.875
Like, strand them all
alone with no phone

14:35.962 --> 14:38.138
service and see how
long they survive?

14:38.225 --> 14:41.750
See, now you're talking
like a psychopath.

14:41.793 --> 14:45.014
It would make
a good reality show.

14:45.101 --> 14:47.495
I bet no one would
notice if she disappeared.

14:47.625 --> 14:49.540
What are you looking at?

14:49.627 --> 14:50.585
Nothing.

14:54.502 --> 14:57.940
Tomorrow, let's go
to the countryside.

14:58.027 --> 14:59.681
Just you and me.

14:59.811 --> 15:01.117
What we came here for.

15:01.161 --> 15:03.467
Mm.

15:03.511 --> 15:04.599
I'd like that.

15:31.626 --> 15:34.411
You're up early.

15:34.455 --> 15:37.414
Look at you, all done up.

15:37.458 --> 15:40.852
Ah, yeah, you.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.812
Long black with milk
and a little bowl of fruit.

15:43.899 --> 15:44.944
Diane's still asleep?

15:44.987 --> 15:46.423
Mm-hmm.

15:46.510 --> 15:47.990
Oh, I've always
been an early riser,

15:48.121 --> 15:49.774
though it's hard here
with how impossible

15:49.905 --> 15:51.559
it is to get a proper latte.

15:51.602 --> 15:54.475
There is nothing I hate
more than wasting the day

15:54.605 --> 15:57.260
away before it's even begun.

15:57.304 --> 15:58.479
Did she tell you the plan?

16:00.524 --> 16:01.830
No.

16:01.917 --> 16:03.527
Yeah, I was texting
her last night.

16:03.658 --> 16:05.355
I sent her the tickets
for that beautiful vineyard,

16:05.486 --> 16:07.444
very exclusive.

16:07.531 --> 16:11.274
She mentioned she'd be happy to
take some photos for me today.

16:11.405 --> 16:14.147
She is so talented.

16:14.234 --> 16:15.322
She did?

16:15.409 --> 16:17.106
Is that right?

16:17.237 --> 16:18.978
Yeah, I was telling her
that she'd do so well being

16:19.065 --> 16:21.284
a photographer for creators.

16:21.371 --> 16:23.983
Yeah, I know some friends
that would love to have her.

16:24.026 --> 16:25.462
I'm gonna set her up with them.

16:25.549 --> 16:27.116
It's such a great
opportunity for her.

16:29.379 --> 16:34.080
She's actually not feeling
very well this morning.

16:34.167 --> 16:35.124
Oh, no.

16:35.168 --> 16:37.431
Yeah, a stomach bug.

16:37.474 --> 16:40.303
I think she's gonna stay
in for the rest of the day.

16:40.347 --> 16:42.479
That's too bad.

16:45.569 --> 16:49.356
But I'd be happy to be
your photographer for the day.

16:49.399 --> 16:52.837
I actually know just
the place we should go.

16:56.189 --> 16:57.973
Let me get her camera.

16:58.060 --> 17:00.497
I'm definitely a red
wine connoisseur myself.

17:00.584 --> 17:03.370
It's all Shiraz in this
area, Syrah grapes.

17:03.500 --> 17:05.763
I'm more of a pinot noir girl.

17:05.807 --> 17:07.330
Do you know much about wine?

17:07.417 --> 17:08.505
No, not really.

17:08.549 --> 17:10.420
Oh, you should learn.

17:10.551 --> 17:13.032
There's so much more depth
to be explored once you

17:13.119 --> 17:15.686
get beneath the typical wine.

17:15.773 --> 17:18.689
I'd be happy to teach you.

17:18.776 --> 17:22.954
Diane mentioned that you're
at school for computer science.

17:23.042 --> 17:24.043
I was.

17:24.130 --> 17:26.088
I dropped out.

17:26.175 --> 17:27.481
I get it.

17:27.568 --> 17:29.004
Pressure was too much.

17:29.091 --> 17:30.310
No, it's not that.

17:33.878 --> 17:38.579
I remember when I wasn't
sure what to do with my life.

17:38.666 --> 17:40.233
We all find our way, though.

17:40.320 --> 17:45.020
I am more than sure
you'll figure it out.

17:45.151 --> 17:47.327
I think it's just around
the corner over here.

17:50.373 --> 17:52.810
Ah, there it is.

17:52.897 --> 17:55.770
Incredible.

17:55.857 --> 17:58.120
Just wait till
you see inside.

18:01.167 --> 18:03.517
I forgot how this works.

18:03.604 --> 18:05.301
Diane was showing me.

18:05.345 --> 18:07.042
Here, let me take
some with your phone.

18:15.355 --> 18:16.356
Perfect.

18:16.443 --> 18:17.835
A little to the left.

18:20.969 --> 18:21.970
Oh, shit.

18:22.057 --> 18:23.189
What's your password?

18:23.276 --> 18:25.756
We don't-- [sighs] whatever.

18:25.843 --> 18:27.193
It's 8546.

18:29.586 --> 18:30.761
Let's go upstairs.

18:30.848 --> 18:32.111
It's really cool up there.

18:34.156 --> 18:35.114
Okay.

18:40.815 --> 18:43.861
Ah, the lighting's
just perfect.

18:43.948 --> 18:44.906
Here.

18:44.993 --> 18:46.603
Stand over there.

18:46.734 --> 18:48.910
The photos are
gonna be amazing.

18:48.953 --> 18:50.477
It seems a bit unstable.

18:50.607 --> 18:52.653
No, it's fine.

18:52.740 --> 18:54.524
Diane and I were
here yesterday.

18:54.655 --> 18:55.656
Okay.

19:12.412 --> 19:15.154
It looks like a long drop.

19:54.584 --> 19:56.064
Help me.

19:56.107 --> 19:57.587
Help.

19:57.674 --> 19:58.719
Please.

20:03.114 --> 20:04.072
Help.

20:04.115 --> 20:05.073
Help.

20:08.250 --> 20:09.208
Please!

20:11.035 --> 20:12.080
Help!

20:12.123 --> 20:13.081
Help!

21:17.188 --> 21:18.320
Hey.

21:18.407 --> 21:19.756
Where have you been?

21:19.843 --> 21:21.280
I texted you.

21:21.410 --> 21:23.064
I went for a run
this morning.

21:23.151 --> 21:25.371
I couldn't sleep.

21:25.501 --> 21:26.894
Okay?

21:26.981 --> 21:28.852
Well, I just went to the pool.

21:28.939 --> 21:30.550
I wanna go get a shower.

21:30.593 --> 21:31.464
Have you eaten?

21:31.507 --> 21:32.508
Yeah.

21:32.595 --> 21:34.205
I ate before I left.

21:34.249 --> 21:35.206
I'll come join you in a bit.

21:35.337 --> 21:36.991
Okay.

21:37.078 --> 21:38.906
Before I forget, Charlotte,
she won't stop texting me.

21:38.993 --> 21:41.169
She wants us to go
to that vineyard thing.

21:41.256 --> 21:44.215
I told her that
we were busy, and

21:44.259 --> 21:46.174
I was thinking that
the two of us could just--

21:46.261 --> 21:48.568
Yeah, we should go.

21:48.698 --> 21:49.830
The vineyard sounds nice.

21:56.880 --> 21:58.317
Hi.

21:58.404 --> 22:00.667
Yeah, but the original
vineyard was just

22:00.797 --> 22:03.409
seven hectares in the 1965.

22:03.539 --> 22:05.193
It's strange.

22:05.280 --> 22:07.804
I texted her, but I still
haven't heard anything.

22:07.935 --> 22:09.197
Maybe she got sick.

22:09.328 --> 22:10.851
But you'd think
she'd let us know.

22:10.981 --> 22:12.548
She lets us know
everything else about her.

22:18.467 --> 22:20.426
And here, we have
the grapevine rose.

22:30.305 --> 22:31.262
Now, can anyone guess--

22:32.916 --> 22:36.050
which grape variety we
grow the most of here?

22:36.093 --> 22:37.573
Syrah.

22:37.617 --> 22:39.532
That is correct.

22:39.619 --> 22:40.968
Very good.

22:46.887 --> 22:48.932
This is better.

22:49.063 --> 22:50.804
So nice of her
to give us the room.

22:56.810 --> 22:58.551
I mean, she's gone, so--

22:58.594 --> 23:00.596
Yeah.

23:00.727 --> 23:03.991
It's strange of her
to run off like that.

23:04.078 --> 23:05.166
I wonder if something happened.

23:07.908 --> 23:11.172
I told you, girls like that
only care about themselves.

23:14.262 --> 23:16.656
This weekend's shaping
up exactly as I'd hoped.

23:51.734 --> 23:53.083
I could use a bit help.

24:05.618 --> 24:06.575
Who's that?

24:08.621 --> 24:09.752
Oh.

24:09.883 --> 24:10.797
Just an old friend.

24:13.103 --> 24:15.105
She's quite pretty.

24:15.149 --> 24:16.150
Yeah.

24:47.442 --> 24:48.704
I'm going to bed.

24:48.748 --> 24:49.749
Night.

25:05.286 --> 25:07.636
Do you need anything?

25:07.723 --> 25:09.725
No, I'm good.

25:09.812 --> 25:11.553
See you in a bit.

27:34.827 --> 27:35.828
Diane?

27:44.750 --> 27:47.317
I don't understand.

27:55.325 --> 27:56.936
Is your name even Catherine?

28:01.897 --> 28:03.856
Why do you have access
to Charlotte's account?

28:09.470 --> 28:10.689
I can explain.

28:25.312 --> 28:27.575
You've done this before.

28:27.618 --> 28:29.795
Diane.

28:29.882 --> 28:31.231
What were you
doing in Thailand?

28:33.886 --> 28:36.236
I've never been to Thailand.

28:36.366 --> 28:37.367
Yes, you have.

28:40.849 --> 28:41.894
What did you read?

28:46.507 --> 28:48.030
Several girls were killed.

28:55.995 --> 28:56.822
I'm gonna call the police.

28:56.952 --> 28:57.823
No, don't.

28:57.910 --> 28:59.085
Please, Diane.

28:59.128 --> 29:00.086
Diane.

29:03.785 --> 29:05.265
Diane, I love you.

29:09.051 --> 29:10.400
You lied to me.

29:17.494 --> 29:18.844
I was going to tell you.

29:22.151 --> 29:25.111
Tell me what?

29:25.198 --> 29:27.374
That you're an actual
fucking psychopath?

30:03.453 --> 30:04.628

31:15.177 --> 31:19.225
She took my identity,
and nobody believed me.

31:19.312 --> 31:21.227
That's the claim
of our next guest, who,

31:21.270 --> 31:23.229
just over a year
ago, was embroiled

31:23.272 --> 31:27.407
in controversy over the death
of her boyfriend, Ryan Evans.

31:27.494 --> 31:30.627
We're taking you all the way
over to Thailand with this one.

31:30.671 --> 31:33.717
A true trouble in paradise.

31:33.848 --> 31:37.286
Authorities found the remains
of two women, Becky Wilson and

31:37.330 --> 31:40.333
Laura Gallagher, on a small,
uninhabited island

31:40.420 --> 31:42.204
in the Gulf of Thailand.

31:42.335 --> 31:45.512
She returned with two bodies
on a boat, both Ryan Evans and

31:45.642 --> 31:49.081
Jessica Matthews, claiming to
authorities that she had left

31:49.168 --> 31:51.083
the murderer on the island.

31:51.170 --> 31:55.174
However, when they showed
up, the island was empty.

31:55.217 --> 31:57.350
No murderer.

31:57.437 --> 31:59.700
The supposed suspect,
a woman known only

31:59.787 --> 32:02.616
by the name CW, who has
a prominent birthmark

32:02.703 --> 32:04.487
on the right side of her face.

32:04.574 --> 32:07.534
Yet, somehow, no
clear photos of her

32:07.621 --> 32:10.667
exist, no record of any kind.

32:10.711 --> 32:14.410
She disappeared like
a ghost in the wind.

32:14.541 --> 32:17.936
Which leads us to our guest,
who initially became a suspect,

32:18.066 --> 32:19.938
but was ultimately
cleared of all charges

32:20.068 --> 32:21.591
due to the lack of evidence.

32:21.678 --> 32:24.681
Four dead bodies,
two others missing.

32:24.725 --> 32:26.466
And no culprit.

32:30.774 --> 32:32.689
Very excited
for our guest today,

32:32.733 --> 32:37.520
finally breaking her silence
after all the controversy.

32:37.651 --> 32:41.568
We gave you the infamous
Madison White.

32:41.698 --> 32:42.873
Thanks for coming on.

32:42.961 --> 32:44.092
Welcome to the show.

32:44.136 --> 32:45.702
Thanks for having me.

32:45.746 --> 32:48.227
I really appreciated
everything you guys

32:48.270 --> 32:49.968
said when this all came out.

32:50.011 --> 32:53.188
So you are
completely offline now?

32:53.232 --> 32:55.147
It was too much.

32:55.234 --> 32:59.542
I couldn't go anywhere,
but I'm feeling better now.

32:59.629 --> 33:01.066
I'm back in school, and--

33:01.109 --> 33:03.285
The harassment?

33:03.416 --> 33:05.374
People blamed me.

33:05.505 --> 33:08.247
I mean, you saw what
Ryan's family put out.

33:08.290 --> 33:11.859
Madison always seemed off.

33:11.946 --> 33:15.210
Our relationship was
put under a microscope.

33:15.297 --> 33:19.475
And initially, everything she
put out painted him as abusive,

33:19.562 --> 33:21.825
but then they started
to pick me apart.

33:21.956 --> 33:23.697
Your follower count exploded.

33:23.827 --> 33:25.612
"She put out."

33:25.699 --> 33:27.440
What do you mean by that?

33:27.527 --> 33:29.877
What she wrote about
Ryan on my account.

33:29.964 --> 33:31.661
None of that was true.

33:31.748 --> 33:33.011
I had to move.

33:33.054 --> 33:34.273
People were showing
up at my house.

33:34.316 --> 33:35.578
They found my phone number.

33:35.665 --> 33:37.232
It was awful.

33:37.276 --> 33:38.277
From what I
understand, you claim she

33:38.320 --> 33:39.234
took over your social media.

33:39.278 --> 33:40.583
Yes.

33:40.670 --> 33:42.324
I was on that island
for four weeks.

33:42.411 --> 33:43.282
So you claim.

33:45.632 --> 33:48.156
So I claim?

33:48.243 --> 33:51.812
You were posting throughout
that entire period.

33:51.942 --> 33:53.727
She was posting.

33:53.857 --> 33:56.208
A girl nobody
can seem to find.

33:56.338 --> 34:00.212
I mean, she just disappears?

34:00.299 --> 34:02.562
I don't understand this.

34:02.605 --> 34:06.827
She took over my whole goddamn
life, my account, my banking.

34:06.870 --> 34:11.136
You did delete your account
right after coming home.

34:11.223 --> 34:12.180
Yeah.

34:12.224 --> 34:13.703
The boat was stolen.

34:13.790 --> 34:15.270
The owner was
a local fisherman.

34:15.314 --> 34:16.793
You can't register
a boat as a foreigner.

34:16.924 --> 34:19.796
All the stuff on it
belonged to Ryan or Jessica.

34:19.883 --> 34:23.713
Not one item was owned by CW.

34:23.800 --> 34:25.324
What kind of name is that even?

34:25.411 --> 34:27.630
Like the network.

34:27.717 --> 34:29.328
Yeah.

34:29.415 --> 34:32.505
The whole thing reeks like
a bad made-for-TV movie.

34:32.548 --> 34:34.637
She just brought that
stuff to get rid of it.

34:34.768 --> 34:37.945
She must have had her stuff
stored somewhere else.

34:38.032 --> 34:41.340
There is security footage
of her at the resort I was at.

34:41.427 --> 34:43.298
The hotel confirmed
there was another guest.

34:43.385 --> 34:44.778
It proves nothing.

34:44.908 --> 34:47.259
And the video footage
is barely visible.

34:47.389 --> 34:49.391
The resort is halfway
across the country

34:49.522 --> 34:50.740
from where the island was.

34:50.827 --> 34:52.742
We traveled.

34:52.786 --> 34:55.919
How do you explain Becky and
Laura or the other two girls,

34:56.006 --> 34:57.182
Rhea and Samantha, who they--

34:57.225 --> 34:58.618
Still missing.

34:58.661 --> 35:00.663
More has come out
linking you to them.

35:00.750 --> 35:02.796
Your fingerprints are
all over Becky and

35:02.883 --> 35:04.450
Laura's bodies, nobody else's.

35:04.537 --> 35:08.280
I found them dead,
and I buried them.

35:08.410 --> 35:10.717
What about her other
bungalow where she'd

35:10.847 --> 35:11.892
been living in the jungle?

35:11.935 --> 35:15.069
Rented by Becky Wilson.

35:15.156 --> 35:19.334
The owner hasn't
even met anyone else.

35:19.465 --> 35:22.381
If this CW person,
if she really

35:22.468 --> 35:25.775
does exist, why did she do it?

35:25.862 --> 35:27.473
What did she have to gain?

35:27.603 --> 35:29.649
She took over my entire life.

35:29.779 --> 35:30.998
Yeah, but why?

35:35.350 --> 35:36.482
I don't know.

35:36.612 --> 35:39.093
How did she get
off the island?

35:39.224 --> 35:41.704
You said yourself, it
was miles off the coast.

35:41.791 --> 35:43.706
You were stuck
there, no way off.

35:43.837 --> 35:46.709
If she was able to get off
so easily, why not you?

35:46.840 --> 35:48.668
I don't know.

35:48.755 --> 35:50.800
I mean, according to you,
she's pretty recognizable.

35:50.887 --> 35:54.587
So how does somebody
like that just disappear?

36:06.294 --> 36:08.166
Hey, we're just trying
to get to the truth here.

36:11.212 --> 36:14.128
You guys defended me.

36:14.172 --> 36:16.348
That's the whole reason
I came onto this podcast.

36:16.478 --> 36:23.137
The more that's come out, the
more complicated it all looks.

36:24.312 --> 36:26.053
I was cleared of all charges.

36:29.274 --> 36:30.362
Does that make you innocent?

39:04.516 --> 39:05.430

39:21.837 --> 39:22.838

40:19.895 --> 40:20.853
Hello?

40:20.940 --> 40:22.681
Pizza delivery.

40:22.724 --> 40:24.334
I didn't order any pizza.

40:24.378 --> 40:25.858
Madison White?

40:25.945 --> 40:27.076
I got, like, six pizzas
down here for you.

40:29.905 --> 40:31.820
I didn't order any pizzas.

40:31.907 --> 40:33.779
Come on, lady, just come
downstairs and talk to me.

40:33.866 --> 40:34.954
Leave me the fuck alone!

41:03.156 --> 41:05.680
Where were you last?

41:21.566 --> 41:22.741
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

41:22.828 --> 41:23.916
This is the flight deck.

41:24.003 --> 41:25.657
This is your captain speaking.

41:25.744 --> 41:27.180
We are about to start
our final descent into Paris.

41:27.223 --> 41:28.616
We should have
you on the ground

41:28.703 --> 41:30.009
in approximately 30
minutes from now.

41:30.052 --> 41:31.663
We can thank you
for joining us.

41:31.750 --> 41:33.360
We wish you all a very
pleasant evening in Paris

41:33.491 --> 41:35.754
or wherever
your travels might be.

42:53.266 --> 42:54.310
This is for you.

42:54.441 --> 42:55.442
Thank you.

43:04.016 --> 43:05.191
Hey, guys.

43:05.278 --> 43:07.193
I'm at Chateau Saint Laurent.

43:07.280 --> 43:09.978
It is absolutely gorgeous here.

43:10.065 --> 43:12.111
I'm having
a beautiful pool day.

43:12.198 --> 43:14.156
You guys all have to come.

43:14.243 --> 43:16.115
I'm gonna put up a little
code for you in my bio.

43:22.077 --> 43:23.731
Who are you?

43:47.712 --> 43:48.669
Hello.

43:48.800 --> 43:49.888
I'm checking in.

43:49.931 --> 43:50.932
Passport?

43:57.896 --> 44:00.594
Madison White.

44:00.638 --> 44:02.596
I was also wondering.

44:02.640 --> 44:04.990
I had a couple friends
stay here a few weeks ago.

44:05.077 --> 44:06.818
I'm trying to get
a hold of one of them.

44:06.861 --> 44:08.428
Oh, we don't give
out information

44:08.471 --> 44:09.734
about previous guests.

44:09.821 --> 44:11.649
One girl who has
a birthmark and

44:11.736 --> 44:13.302
another girl with
blonde hair, they were

44:13.433 --> 44:15.130
here back around August 12.

44:17.263 --> 44:19.569
What do you want
to know about them?

44:19.700 --> 44:21.310
Oh, um--

44:21.354 --> 44:22.703
What are their names?

44:22.834 --> 44:23.835
Um.

44:26.751 --> 44:28.013
You don't know their names.

45:11.665 --> 45:12.797
Chateau Saint Laurent.

45:12.884 --> 45:15.538
It is absolutely gorgeous here.

45:15.669 --> 45:17.715

a beautiful pool day.

45:17.802 --> 45:20.065

45:30.466 --> 45:32.033

46:05.240 --> 46:06.154
Bonjour?

46:06.241 --> 46:07.677

46:07.808 --> 46:10.376
I'm trying to get
a hold of your daughter.

46:12.987 --> 46:13.901
I don't know.

46:14.032 --> 46:17.296
I don't speak French.

46:17.339 --> 46:18.340
Diane.

46:18.427 --> 46:20.299
I'm looking for Diane.

46:23.302 --> 46:25.913
I'm trying to get
a hold of her.

46:32.485 --> 46:33.399

46:50.459 --> 46:51.547

47:38.377 --> 47:39.987
My girl's not like that.

47:40.118 --> 47:41.554
Women do not care about
the effort that you put in.

47:41.684 --> 47:43.251
They just want to see
the winner, right?

47:43.295 --> 47:44.557

You'll be alone in a second.

47:47.386 --> 47:48.996
See, women don't understand
the value of work.

47:49.127 --> 47:50.650
They never had to.

47:50.737 --> 47:53.174
That's why they just,
mm, mm, mm, look to us,

47:53.305 --> 47:55.742
because they are opportunistic,
soulless creatures, really.

47:55.873 --> 47:57.265
Everyone's looking
out for themselves.

47:57.396 --> 47:58.832
You're just
hyperfocused on women.

47:58.963 --> 48:00.355
I mean, men are just as bad--
- No, no, no no.

48:00.442 --> 48:02.183
or worse.

48:02.227 --> 48:04.055
A relationship with
a man is not opportunistic.

48:04.142 --> 48:05.230
It is mutual.

48:05.360 --> 48:06.840
You actually like each other.

48:06.971 --> 48:08.276
I already told you,
my girl's not like that.

48:08.363 --> 48:09.930
No.

48:10.017 --> 48:11.845
See, you are a reflection
of how you see yourself,

48:11.976 --> 48:14.761
and your reflection is that of
a pathetic little simp bitch.

48:14.848 --> 48:16.676
This isn't fucking
rocket science, bro.

48:16.719 --> 48:18.330
Lift some fucking weights.

48:18.373 --> 48:20.027
Business only.

48:20.158 --> 48:21.899
Do not let the women set
the press in the relationship.

48:21.986 --> 48:23.596
Don't let a woman
dictate the relationship.

48:23.683 --> 48:25.206
You know this, right?
Man.

48:25.293 --> 48:26.512
Shit, I'm out.
I'm out.

48:26.599 --> 48:27.469
Shit.
I'm out.

48:27.556 --> 48:29.167
I'm getting tilted, bro.

48:29.210 --> 48:30.908
Namaste, faggots.

48:41.744 --> 48:43.442
That went well, I think.

48:43.485 --> 48:44.530
Eh?

48:44.617 --> 48:45.444
Did you see his reaction?

48:45.531 --> 48:47.489
Hmm?

48:47.533 --> 48:48.969
Did you watch?

48:49.013 --> 48:49.927
A bit.

48:55.802 --> 48:59.023
I mean, I thought
it went all right.

48:59.110 --> 49:00.676
I just really
think you can push

49:00.763 --> 49:03.070
further, get under
their skin more,

49:03.114 --> 49:04.767
force them to be the dick.

49:04.898 --> 49:05.855
You're the voice of reason.

49:05.943 --> 49:07.335
Remember that.
- Yeah.

49:07.466 --> 49:09.076
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, you're right.

49:09.207 --> 49:13.602
You need some kind of spark,
something controversial.

49:13.646 --> 49:15.343
Everything is so blasé.

49:15.430 --> 49:17.258
People are getting bored.

49:17.345 --> 49:18.303
You're dropping off.

49:30.445 --> 49:33.579

49:33.666 --> 49:35.668
She's a fucking bitch, dude.

49:35.798 --> 49:37.626
I gotta be honest with you.

49:37.713 --> 49:39.411
You know, I used to have this
thing about not telling my guy

49:39.454 --> 49:41.369
friends they should dump
their girls because, honestly,

49:41.456 --> 49:43.415
if you want to mess your life
up, that's none of my business.

49:43.502 --> 49:45.330
But clearly, you
need a wake up call.

49:45.373 --> 49:47.419
You don't even
fucking know her.

49:47.506 --> 49:49.073
I know that you're not happy.

49:49.160 --> 49:50.161
That, I fucking know.

49:50.291 --> 49:52.032
The way she treats you, dude.

49:52.119 --> 49:53.686
The way that anytime anything
even goes remotely wrong,

49:53.816 --> 49:55.340
she flies off
the fucking rails.

49:55.470 --> 49:57.037
You don't know
the kind of work

49:57.124 --> 49:58.517
that she's putting
in, though, bro.

49:58.560 --> 50:00.388
Like, the stream
is popping off.

50:00.519 --> 50:02.695
You don't believe half
the shit that you're saying.

50:02.825 --> 50:04.175
And where the fuck
are those shots?

50:04.218 --> 50:06.046
I'm giving these
kids purpose, man.

50:06.133 --> 50:08.527

50:10.181 --> 50:12.096
My guy.

50:12.183 --> 50:13.662
I give up.

50:13.749 --> 50:15.969
We've completely lost
the male role model.

50:16.056 --> 50:18.667
And, like, it's just
these young kids that

50:18.798 --> 50:21.148
are, like, so fucking lost.

50:21.235 --> 50:22.541
Okay, prove it.

If you're such a man
like you say you are,

50:38.600 --> 50:39.688

go over there and fuck her.

Well, then how did she get off?

52:06.123 --> 52:07.646
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

52:07.689 --> 52:09.822
You seem familiar.

52:09.909 --> 52:12.433
You remind me of someone.

52:12.520 --> 52:13.478
Not a good thing.

52:16.089 --> 52:17.395
Hey, hold on.

52:17.482 --> 52:19.484
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, just--

52:19.571 --> 52:23.531
if I do run into this mystery
girl, how will I let you know?

52:32.410 --> 52:34.368
What else do I need
to know about her?

52:39.634 --> 52:41.070
Yeah!

53:43.132 --> 53:45.004
Yo, motherfuckers.

53:45.091 --> 53:46.048
Yo.

53:46.135 --> 53:47.093
Morning, chat.

53:47.180 --> 53:48.181
Good morning to all.

53:48.268 --> 53:49.138
What's up, Benny?

53:49.269 --> 53:50.923
I see you.

53:51.010 --> 53:52.446
Yeah, it's late as fuck
here, but we're on the grind.

53:52.533 --> 53:54.883
Grinding every
fucking day out here.

53:54.927 --> 53:55.971
We all up late out here.

53:56.058 --> 53:57.190
Benny, thanks for the five.

53:57.321 --> 53:58.365
I got some videos.

53:58.496 --> 54:01.368
This is some dog shit.

54:41.582 --> 54:42.801
Oh, yeah.

54:56.380 --> 54:58.730
Okay, this side.

54:58.817 --> 55:00.862
We should take some more
photos by the pool later.

55:00.906 --> 55:01.994
Oh, yeah.

55:02.124 --> 55:02.908
I have some photos to show you.

55:03.038 --> 55:03.996
It's gonna be beautiful.

55:13.527 --> 55:14.963
Good.

55:16.530 --> 55:18.489
Hold your hair.

55:23.407 --> 55:25.060
Marissa finally got engaged.

55:25.147 --> 55:26.932
Mm.

55:27.062 --> 55:30.065
Ever since they've had that
kid, they've been dominating.

55:30.152 --> 55:31.893
It's not even that cute.

55:31.980 --> 55:33.547
She asked us
to come over later.

55:33.678 --> 55:36.245
I said we would, but I
don't want to stay too late.

55:36.333 --> 55:40.032
I noticed Nutrigrains hasn't
sent their last payment yet.

55:40.119 --> 55:43.252
Have you followed up
with them about that?

55:43.340 --> 55:44.384
Jacob.

55:44.471 --> 55:45.385
What's up?

55:45.472 --> 55:46.560
Are you listening?

55:46.647 --> 55:47.605
Ah.

55:47.692 --> 55:49.041
Yeah, no.

55:49.128 --> 55:50.695
Okay, you need to be
on that because I

55:50.738 --> 55:52.000
can't be the one who's--
- I know.

55:52.087 --> 55:53.741
Right.
I know.

55:53.828 --> 55:55.787
Hey.

55:55.874 --> 55:59.443
I love you, okay?

55:59.486 --> 56:01.314
You know that.

56:01.445 --> 56:03.621
It's because I care.

56:03.708 --> 56:04.665
One second.

56:11.542 --> 56:12.978
You're not a murderer, are you?

56:14.588 --> 56:15.459
What?

56:15.546 --> 56:17.112
No?

56:17.156 --> 56:18.462
Are you sure?

56:18.549 --> 56:20.072
Unless there's
another girl in Bali

56:20.159 --> 56:21.508
that looks exactly like you.

56:21.595 --> 56:24.119
There's a girl looking for you.

56:24.206 --> 56:25.773
Who?

56:25.904 --> 56:28.689
Mentioned something about
a dead girl in France,

56:28.776 --> 56:29.690
met you in Thailand.

56:31.866 --> 56:32.911
It sounded ridiculous.

56:32.998 --> 56:34.303
You'd get caught immediately.

56:34.391 --> 56:35.653
How'd you get off the island?

56:37.698 --> 56:38.569
Excuse me?

56:42.181 --> 56:44.096
You're really not gonna
give me anything, huh?

56:48.883 --> 56:50.581
Okay.

56:50.668 --> 56:51.582
Just kidding.

56:53.975 --> 56:56.195
Good luck, killer.

57:53.426 --> 57:55.036
She's back.

57:55.123 --> 57:56.255
Hey.

57:56.298 --> 57:57.386
How's your day going?

57:57.517 --> 57:58.431
Fine.

57:58.562 --> 57:59.780
Several updates.

57:59.867 --> 58:01.565
Few new messages
from the States.

58:01.608 --> 58:04.306
Nothing too out of the ordinary
but flag worthy.

58:04.393 --> 58:06.831
Let's pause all
communication on everything.

58:06.874 --> 58:10.443
We may need to pack up and move
again, potentially quickly.

58:10.574 --> 58:12.663
Is there any updates
on the investigation?

58:12.793 --> 58:14.578
I haven't found
any new articles.

58:14.665 --> 58:17.755
No, I think
we're in the clear.

58:34.293 --> 58:36.425
Madison's here.

58:36.513 --> 58:38.602
Why?

58:38.732 --> 58:40.125
I don't know.

58:40.212 --> 58:42.867
I think she's looking for me.

58:42.954 --> 58:46.087
How does she
know you're here?

58:46.131 --> 58:48.263
I don't know.

58:48.394 --> 58:51.658
The only people who know
we're here are your parents.

58:51.745 --> 58:54.487
Madison doesn't know
my parents, does she?

58:56.620 --> 58:57.534
No.

59:01.015 --> 59:02.408
Then how did she find us?

59:33.787 --> 59:35.267
How did she find us?

59:35.354 --> 59:37.312
All her accounts
are still inactive.

59:37.356 --> 59:39.010
She's offline.

59:39.097 --> 59:40.489
Not surprising.

59:40.577 --> 59:42.840
Does she know your real name?

59:42.927 --> 59:45.582
What else does she know?

59:45.712 --> 59:47.671
She knows about Charlotte.

59:47.758 --> 59:48.715
How?

59:48.846 --> 59:50.325
Do something for me.

59:50.456 --> 59:53.067
Let's do a search
for males ages 25 to 35,

59:53.154 --> 59:54.678
brown eyes, short hair.

59:54.808 --> 59:56.331
Anyone who's been here
in the last few weeks.

59:56.462 --> 59:57.463
Got it.

01:00:07.342 --> 01:00:08.517
Wait.
Hold.

01:00:08.605 --> 01:00:09.606
Go back.

01:00:12.521 --> 01:00:13.479
There.

01:00:28.189 --> 01:00:30.017
Let's go!

01:00:34.369 --> 01:00:35.849
Woo!

01:00:35.893 --> 01:00:36.807
Yeah!

01:01:02.789 --> 01:01:03.790
It's her.

01:01:06.445 --> 01:01:07.968
What are you going to do?

01:02:18.299 --> 01:02:21.041
She wouldn't be stupid
enough to come alone.

01:02:21.128 --> 01:02:23.870
But it didn't seem like
she was with anyone.

01:02:24.001 --> 01:02:25.567
What am I missing?

01:02:25.698 --> 01:02:27.265
What if you just lay low?

01:02:27.395 --> 01:02:29.658
She wouldn't be
able to find you.

01:02:29.702 --> 01:02:31.095
Check this out.

01:02:31.225 --> 01:02:33.010
You hear about those
murders in Thailand?

01:02:33.053 --> 01:02:34.272
No?
Okay, okay.

01:02:34.359 --> 01:02:35.273
Get this, get this.

01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:36.622
So I'm at the club.

01:02:36.753 --> 01:02:38.015
I'm chatting up
this chick, right?

01:02:38.102 --> 01:02:40.104
Turns out her name
is Madison White.

01:02:40.191 --> 01:02:41.583
Look, look.

01:02:41.670 --> 01:02:43.803
She was arrested
in Thailand last year.

01:02:43.847 --> 01:02:45.239
Last fucking year.

01:02:45.326 --> 01:02:47.111
And she claims
she's here looking

01:02:47.241 --> 01:02:48.852
for the real fucking killer,
this girl with the birthmark.

01:02:48.939 --> 01:02:49.853
No way.

01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:51.289
Yeah, yeah.

01:02:51.332 --> 01:02:53.247
So the next day,
the next fucking day,

01:02:53.378 --> 01:02:54.683
I run into that chick.

01:02:54.771 --> 01:02:55.728
Yeah.

01:02:55.859 --> 01:02:57.338
That fucking chick, bro.

01:02:57.425 --> 01:02:58.818
Like, I only talked
to her for a second.

01:02:58.949 --> 01:02:59.906
She wasn't giving me
shit, but it was her.

01:02:59.993 --> 01:03:00.907
It was fucking her.

01:03:01.038 --> 01:03:02.126
Do you think she did it?

01:03:02.256 --> 01:03:03.388
I mean, I don't know, bro.

01:03:03.518 --> 01:03:04.998
I don't fucking know.

01:03:05.129 --> 01:03:07.174
Like, everything online
points to the first chick,

01:03:07.218 --> 01:03:09.350
but I'm telling you,
chat, like, really?

01:03:09.394 --> 01:03:10.438
Like, really?

01:03:10.525 --> 01:03:11.831
This bitch is tiny, like--

01:03:11.875 --> 01:03:12.832
Ah.

01:03:12.919 --> 01:03:13.964
Is she hot?

01:03:14.051 --> 01:03:14.878
I think we should leave.

01:03:14.965 --> 01:03:16.618
No.

01:03:16.662 --> 01:03:18.272
There's a better
way out of this.

01:03:18.359 --> 01:03:20.535
Neither of them
can prove anything.

01:03:20.579 --> 01:03:21.972
I just need--

01:03:22.102 --> 01:03:23.364
She's a fucking redhead, bro.

01:03:23.451 --> 01:03:24.801
you.

01:03:24.888 --> 01:03:26.324
Like, that shit
might be nasty, right?

01:03:26.367 --> 01:03:28.195
Like, when I went
up to her, like,

01:03:28.282 --> 01:03:30.807
she was giving me the-- she was
giving me those fucking vibes.

01:03:30.937 --> 01:03:33.418
I got some food for thought.

01:03:33.461 --> 01:03:35.986
Some morning thoughts.

01:03:36.073 --> 01:03:40.512
I always get these
comments asking me,

01:03:40.599 --> 01:03:42.819
how can I acquire wealth?

01:03:42.949 --> 01:03:45.996
What does it take
to become rich?

01:03:46.083 --> 01:03:47.040
It's all mental.

01:03:47.127 --> 01:03:48.694
It's all a mental game.

01:03:48.781 --> 01:03:50.783
Let's just say that a man
wins the lottery, right?

01:03:50.914 --> 01:03:53.003
Well, if he hasn't carved
out that mentality,

01:03:53.046 --> 01:03:54.656
if he hasn't locked it
in, he's going to lose

01:03:54.787 --> 01:03:56.789
it all in six weeks, right?

01:03:56.920 --> 01:04:00.532
So don't be a wage cuck.

01:04:00.619 --> 01:04:01.750
Find me a street
view to match this.

01:04:01.881 --> 01:04:02.839
Got it.

01:04:10.542 --> 01:04:12.109
Found it.

01:05:05.510 --> 01:05:07.816
You can't love others
until you love yourself.

01:05:07.904 --> 01:05:10.167
We've all heard this
a million times.

01:05:10.210 --> 01:05:12.038
This is a lie.

01:05:12.125 --> 01:05:13.953
We are living in a world of
corrupt morals and degeneracy.

01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:17.739

This girl is fucking hot, man.

01:06:05.265 --> 01:06:07.093
She's just eating
out of my hand.

01:06:07.180 --> 01:06:08.399
Look at this shit.

01:06:08.486 --> 01:06:09.878
- You don't recognize her?
- What?

01:06:09.966 --> 01:06:10.967
This girl?

01:06:11.097 --> 01:06:11.968
I doubt she's gonna show.

01:06:12.055 --> 01:06:13.534
No, my dude.

01:06:13.578 --> 01:06:14.666
She said she's bring

01:06:14.753 --> 01:06:16.276
I'm telling you, bro.

01:06:16.363 --> 01:06:17.495
You've got to get back
on the horse with me.

01:06:17.625 --> 01:06:19.497
I've told you.

01:06:19.627 --> 01:06:22.326
Man, you and me, single, it'd
feel like Ibiza all over again.

01:06:22.369 --> 01:06:23.718
Come on.
I want my wingman back.

01:06:23.762 --> 01:06:24.676
Oh my god.

01:06:24.719 --> 01:06:25.764
Hi.

01:06:27.809 --> 01:06:31.422
You're the one that came up
to me about that psychopath

01:06:31.509 --> 01:06:34.033
that's been stalking me.

01:06:34.077 --> 01:06:35.469
What?

01:06:38.733 --> 01:06:42.041
So you're sure she meant you?

01:06:42.128 --> 01:06:46.785
She called me and said
I did these awful things.

01:06:46.872 --> 01:06:48.656
I don't understand.

01:06:48.743 --> 01:06:52.225
I met her one time, and now
she's trying to frame me.

01:06:52.312 --> 01:06:53.357
Maybe you can help me.

01:06:55.663 --> 01:06:57.926
Hey, I'm scared.

01:06:58.014 --> 01:07:01.191
I mean, just call the cops.

01:07:01.321 --> 01:07:02.931
They're not gonna help me.

01:07:02.975 --> 01:07:04.063
I can't prove it.

01:07:04.150 --> 01:07:07.110
They'd just turn me away.

01:07:07.153 --> 01:07:09.286
Please.

01:07:10.678 --> 01:07:12.245
There you are.

01:07:12.289 --> 01:07:13.072
I've been looking all
over the place for you.

01:07:13.116 --> 01:07:14.465
Come on.

01:07:14.552 --> 01:07:15.770
We're heading back to mine.
Come on.

01:07:15.901 --> 01:07:16.945
We're going.
Let's go.

01:07:17.076 --> 01:07:18.121
All right.

01:07:18.208 --> 01:07:19.165
Well, I gotta go, but we can--

01:07:19.209 --> 01:07:20.819
I'll talk to you later.

01:07:20.906 --> 01:07:22.038
What are you talking about?
No, no, no.

01:07:22.125 --> 01:07:23.213
You're invited.
Come with us.

01:07:23.256 --> 01:07:24.779
- Come with.
- Jesus Christ.

01:07:24.910 --> 01:07:26.216

I just don't understand what

I'm all alone here.

01:08:27.842 --> 01:08:29.453
She's following me.

01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:30.497
I'm scared.

01:08:30.584 --> 01:08:31.585
Mm-hmm.

01:08:33.935 --> 01:08:34.936
What?

01:08:35.023 --> 01:08:36.329
She doesn't seem the type.

01:08:36.460 --> 01:08:39.419
You don't
understand this girl.

01:08:39.463 --> 01:08:41.465
She's like a chameleon.

01:08:41.508 --> 01:08:43.206
One moment, she
pretends like she's

01:08:43.336 --> 01:08:45.773
this small, innocent girl
who doesn't know anything,

01:08:45.817 --> 01:08:49.864
and then she's
suddenly different.

01:08:49.908 --> 01:08:52.954
She has this way
of making you come to her.

01:08:53.041 --> 01:08:59.091
She finds out exactly what you
want and plays right into it.

01:08:59.222 --> 01:09:01.485
I wouldn't be surprised
if she was twisting her way

01:09:01.615 --> 01:09:02.834
into your life as we speak.

01:09:05.663 --> 01:09:06.533
What?

01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:09.188
She's crazy.

01:09:09.275 --> 01:09:12.452
She probably gets
a kick out of it.

01:09:12.539 --> 01:09:15.890
Maybe it's just fun
for her or she's jealous.

01:09:15.934 --> 01:09:17.936
I don't know.

01:09:18.066 --> 01:09:19.155
Maybe she's just nuts.

01:09:22.593 --> 01:09:24.856
I'm scared.

01:09:24.943 --> 01:09:27.424
You just-- you
have this energy.

01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:31.950
I feel safe with you.

01:09:36.955 --> 01:09:38.304
Oh my god!

01:09:38.348 --> 01:09:40.176
What are you doing?

01:09:40.219 --> 01:09:41.177
Dude.

01:09:44.484 --> 01:09:46.573
Can we go somewhere
more private?

01:10:04.243 --> 01:10:05.201
Whoa, listen.

01:10:07.681 --> 01:10:11.294
Just-- I have a girlfriend.

01:10:15.907 --> 01:10:16.908
I don't care.

01:10:25.264 --> 01:10:26.222
I do.

01:10:31.227 --> 01:10:34.752
I thought you were some
strong male role model.

01:10:34.795 --> 01:10:37.624
I've never cheated
on my girlfriend.

01:10:37.668 --> 01:10:38.712
I love her.

01:10:41.846 --> 01:10:43.108
Hey, I can help you.

01:10:54.511 --> 01:10:58.515
I need you to help me
confront her publicly.

01:10:58.602 --> 01:11:00.081
She needs to be exposed.

01:11:00.168 --> 01:11:01.474
Do you still have her number?

01:11:01.605 --> 01:11:03.868
I do.

01:11:03.955 --> 01:11:06.566
I think she
knows where I live.

01:11:06.653 --> 01:11:07.437
Can I stay at yours?

01:11:07.567 --> 01:11:08.612
No.

01:11:10.701 --> 01:11:13.269
I can't be alone right now.

01:11:13.356 --> 01:11:17.098
We can go to my place
tomorrow and figure it out, but

01:11:17.185 --> 01:11:19.231
not tonight.

01:11:19.362 --> 01:11:23.017
You can stay here, but--

01:11:23.148 --> 01:11:25.237
I get it.

01:11:25.324 --> 01:11:28.327
So honorable of you.

01:14:55.447 --> 01:14:57.405
Oh, yeah.

01:14:57.493 --> 01:14:58.885
Oh, fuck me right there.

01:14:58.972 --> 01:15:00.408
Uh-huh.

01:15:06.284 --> 01:15:09.635
You like that,
you little bitch?

01:15:09.766 --> 01:15:11.898
You're pathetic.

01:15:11.985 --> 01:15:13.247
What the fuck?

01:15:15.336 --> 01:15:17.904
Who the fuck are you?

01:15:17.991 --> 01:15:22.605
I-- I know Jacob.

01:15:22.735 --> 01:15:24.258
Okay?

01:15:24.302 --> 01:15:26.652
He's not here.

01:15:26.783 --> 01:15:28.001
I'm waiting for him.

01:15:31.091 --> 01:15:33.746
And you just decided
to go on his computer?

01:15:33.877 --> 01:15:34.747
Yeah.

01:15:34.878 --> 01:15:37.445
He said I could.

01:15:37.576 --> 01:15:40.013
Who are you?

01:15:40.144 --> 01:15:43.234
You're in my house.

01:15:43.277 --> 01:15:44.235
I'm calling Jacob.

01:15:47.804 --> 01:15:48.979
Yeah, I'm gonna go.

01:15:51.329 --> 01:15:52.678
No, you're not, actually.

01:15:52.809 --> 01:15:53.810
I'm gonna call the police.

01:15:53.897 --> 01:15:54.811
You can talk to them.

01:15:58.641 --> 01:15:59.685
What do you want to know?

01:16:02.862 --> 01:16:04.472
If I fucked him?

01:16:09.521 --> 01:16:12.480
I don't know what your little
setup is here, but yeah, I did.

01:16:34.851 --> 01:16:36.287
She's back.

01:16:36.330 --> 01:16:37.288
Hey.

01:19:45.041 --> 01:19:45.955
Hi.

01:19:48.348 --> 01:19:49.872
Hello.

01:20:33.176 --> 01:20:34.133
I'm gonna take them off.

01:20:42.446 --> 01:20:43.664
I don't want to be lied to.

01:20:48.191 --> 01:20:49.148
I've been hurt before.

01:20:52.804 --> 01:20:54.371
I want to be
able to be honest.

01:21:00.551 --> 01:21:01.726
Tell me something then.

01:21:04.468 --> 01:21:05.469
Like what?

01:21:12.302 --> 01:21:15.044
Like-- like what
happened to your eye?

01:21:17.916 --> 01:21:21.746
I got stranded on an island
in the middle of the ocean.

01:21:23.966 --> 01:21:28.274
Someone got the best
of me and left me to die.

01:21:28.405 --> 01:21:29.449
What?

01:21:29.536 --> 01:21:30.886
Yeah.

01:21:30.973 --> 01:21:32.844
True story.

01:21:32.975 --> 01:21:33.976
How'd you get off?

01:21:34.063 --> 01:21:35.368
What?

01:21:35.455 --> 01:21:37.631
Of the island.

01:21:37.718 --> 01:21:38.763
How'd you get off of it?

01:21:41.592 --> 01:21:43.246
That's what
you're attaching to?

01:21:47.206 --> 01:21:50.383
I've done a lot of things
I'm not exactly proud of.

01:21:54.866 --> 01:21:57.260
We've all done things
we're not happy with.

01:22:04.223 --> 01:22:06.095
It's what we do with
it that matters.

01:23:38.274 --> 01:23:39.275
Diane?

01:23:41.668 --> 01:23:43.322
Diane?

01:23:43.409 --> 01:23:44.367
No, no, no, no.

01:23:48.545 --> 01:23:49.807
No, no, no no, no,
no, no, no, no.

01:23:49.894 --> 01:23:51.113
Wake up.
Wake up.

01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:53.028
Wake up.

01:23:53.115 --> 01:23:56.161
Wake up No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:23:56.248 --> 01:23:57.293
Wake up.
Wake up.

01:23:57.336 --> 01:23:58.250
Wake up.
Wake up.

01:23:58.294 --> 01:23:59.338
Wake up.

01:23:59.382 --> 01:24:01.514
No, I didn't mean to.

01:24:02.994 --> 01:24:04.865
No, no, no, no, no.

01:24:07.912 --> 01:24:09.870
I'd like to be able
to be honest with you.

01:24:16.964 --> 01:24:17.922
I'll be right back.

01:24:40.031 --> 01:24:40.988
All good?

01:24:41.119 --> 01:24:42.077
Yeah.

01:24:57.179 --> 01:24:58.093
I love you.

01:25:00.356 --> 01:25:01.270
I love you.

01:25:03.489 --> 01:25:04.447
I love you.

01:25:07.319 --> 01:25:08.277
I love you.

01:25:11.541 --> 01:25:12.542
I love you.

01:25:14.848 --> 01:25:15.806
I love you.

01:25:17.895 --> 01:25:20.680
I love you.

01:25:37.436 --> 01:25:39.046
Come on, Jacob.

01:26:22.351 --> 01:26:23.656
- Ariana?
- Cameron.

01:26:23.743 --> 01:26:24.657
Thank god.

01:26:24.744 --> 01:26:26.093
Where's Jacob?

01:26:26.224 --> 01:26:28.183
He's-- Jacob?

01:26:28.270 --> 01:26:29.184
Cameron.

01:26:33.797 --> 01:26:35.015
Jacob is--

01:26:35.102 --> 01:26:36.103
Cameron, where
the fuck is he?

01:26:36.191 --> 01:26:37.148
Fuck.

01:26:37.192 --> 01:26:38.976
Yo, bitch, calm down.

01:26:39.063 --> 01:26:40.020
Cameron, I swear to god, you
put him on the fucking phone

01:26:40.107 --> 01:26:41.805
right now.

01:26:41.892 --> 01:26:43.415
How about you pack
your little bags and move on?

01:26:43.502 --> 01:26:46.810
Because Jacob is in my room,
and he's not alone.

01:26:46.940 --> 01:26:48.551
And he told me everything.

01:26:51.075 --> 01:26:51.945
He did?

01:26:52.076 --> 01:26:53.295
Yeah.

01:26:53.425 --> 01:26:54.948
He did.

01:26:55.079 --> 01:26:58.604
He's over you, and he's
sick of all your bullshit.

01:26:58.691 --> 01:27:02.304
And I don't think
he cares what you

01:27:02.391 --> 01:27:06.656
do, so why don't you fuck off?

01:27:16.492 --> 01:27:17.449
No.

01:27:17.493 --> 01:27:18.494
What?

01:28:33.438 --> 01:28:35.571
Wake up, big boy.

01:28:37.137 --> 01:28:38.051
Come on.

01:28:38.138 --> 01:28:39.139
Wake up.

01:28:39.226 --> 01:28:40.184
It's time to go.

01:28:41.968 --> 01:28:43.840
Oh.

01:28:43.883 --> 01:28:46.016
Fuck me.

01:28:46.059 --> 01:28:47.104
Oh.

01:29:21.878 --> 01:29:23.401
Can I use your phone?

01:29:23.488 --> 01:29:25.360
I think I broke mine.

01:29:32.323 --> 01:29:33.585
Do you want my help or not?

01:29:33.672 --> 01:29:34.630
Just--

01:30:27.291 --> 01:30:28.292
We should go.

01:30:32.818 --> 01:30:35.691
You like that,
you little bitch?

01:30:35.778 --> 01:30:37.519
You're pathetic.

01:30:49.748 --> 01:30:50.880
Hey, dude.

01:30:50.967 --> 01:30:52.011
Can I talk to you for a second?

01:30:52.098 --> 01:30:53.012
Yeah.

01:30:53.099 --> 01:30:54.840
I'll meet you out there.

01:30:54.927 --> 01:30:55.928
What the fuck?

01:30:56.059 --> 01:30:57.626
Are you jerking off?

01:30:57.713 --> 01:30:59.236
I-- uh--

01:30:59.323 --> 01:31:00.193
Oh, look, look.

01:31:00.324 --> 01:31:01.847
Listen.

01:31:01.891 --> 01:31:03.327
About that chick,
there's nothing going on.

01:31:03.458 --> 01:31:04.807
Hey, do you remember
that blonde that you

01:31:04.850 --> 01:31:06.156
matched with on Tinder?
Never mind.

01:31:06.243 --> 01:31:07.723
It's way too complicated.

01:31:07.810 --> 01:31:11.857
That girl, she might
be wanted for murder.

01:31:11.988 --> 01:31:13.076
What?

01:31:13.163 --> 01:31:14.512
Dude, I have this whole plan.

01:31:14.556 --> 01:31:15.470
She thinks I'm falling
for it, but I'm

01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:16.993
gonna catch her red-handed.

01:31:17.036 --> 01:31:18.298
I mean, Ariana
doesn't know about it.

01:31:18.429 --> 01:31:20.387
But man, I'm
telling you, this is

01:31:20.475 --> 01:31:22.694
gonna bring the stream
to the next fucking level,

01:31:22.781 --> 01:31:24.566
like, viral shit, bro.

01:31:24.653 --> 01:31:25.567
Right.

01:31:25.697 --> 01:31:26.872
Yeah.

01:31:27.003 --> 01:31:27.873
What's up, man?

01:31:28.004 --> 01:31:29.353
You good?

01:31:29.396 --> 01:31:31.703
So you haven't
talked to Ariana yet?

01:31:31.747 --> 01:31:32.704
No.

01:31:32.748 --> 01:31:33.705
No, man.

01:31:33.792 --> 01:31:35.664
It's a surprise.

01:31:35.707 --> 01:31:37.753
She's been trying to find ways
to build up the brand, bro,

01:31:37.796 --> 01:31:38.710
but this is it.

01:31:38.797 --> 01:31:40.495
This is fucking it.

01:31:40.582 --> 01:31:42.801
Hey, my phone's busted,
but I'm going home.

01:31:42.888 --> 01:31:45.587
If she calls, tell her I'm
bringing home a gold mine.

01:32:04.823 --> 01:32:06.303
It's just weird
because Ariana doesn't normally

01:32:06.346 --> 01:32:07.391
do this kind of stuff.

01:32:12.439 --> 01:32:13.397
Jacob.

01:32:15.617 --> 01:32:17.009
How did you get in here?

01:32:17.140 --> 01:32:19.272
The door was open.

01:32:19.359 --> 01:32:22.058
She's not moving, Jacob.

01:32:22.188 --> 01:32:23.538
What the fuck did you do?

01:32:27.454 --> 01:32:28.412
Hey.

01:32:28.455 --> 01:32:29.761
No.

01:32:29.805 --> 01:32:30.762
No.

01:32:30.849 --> 01:32:31.807
No, no, no.

01:32:31.850 --> 01:32:33.112
What the fuck?

01:32:33.199 --> 01:32:34.592
Oh, shit.

01:32:34.679 --> 01:32:36.463
It's time to turn
yourself in.

01:32:36.594 --> 01:32:38.161
It's over.

01:32:38.248 --> 01:32:39.771
Why in the hell do
you think I'd do that?

01:32:39.815 --> 01:32:41.643
You're gonna run out
of places to run away to.

01:32:41.730 --> 01:32:42.818
You think--

01:32:42.905 --> 01:32:44.384
I had nothing to do with her.

01:32:44.515 --> 01:32:45.821
- What did you do?
- Me?

01:32:45.908 --> 01:32:47.474
I didn't.

01:32:47.605 --> 01:32:49.738
She-- when your phone texted
me, I knew it was her.

01:32:49.781 --> 01:32:51.043
I came early like
we talked about.

01:32:51.174 --> 01:32:52.262
I did what you said.

01:32:52.349 --> 01:32:53.698
I did what you said.

01:32:53.785 --> 01:32:55.482
She pretended to be
you to Cameron,

01:32:55.526 --> 01:32:57.746
and exactly like you
said, she came up to us.

01:32:57.833 --> 01:32:58.834
You two were setting me up?

01:32:58.964 --> 01:33:00.226
She's manipulating you.

01:33:00.270 --> 01:33:01.750
It's her.

01:33:01.837 --> 01:33:03.142
The door was wide
open when we got here.

01:33:03.229 --> 01:33:04.622
- Oh, fuck.
- Jacob, I told you.

01:33:04.709 --> 01:33:05.928
She's doing exactly
what I said.

01:33:06.058 --> 01:33:07.538
Which one of you did this?

01:33:07.582 --> 01:33:09.018
Which one of you did this!

01:33:09.061 --> 01:33:10.454
Jacob, I swear.

01:33:10.541 --> 01:33:12.325
She's been playing
you this whole time.

01:33:12.412 --> 01:33:13.762
I told you she'd tried to
entwine herself into your life.

01:33:13.849 --> 01:33:15.241
Fuck you.

01:33:15.328 --> 01:33:16.503
I've been with Jacob
this entire time.

01:33:16.591 --> 01:33:17.896
How would I--

01:33:21.160 --> 01:33:23.162
What the fuck?

01:33:23.249 --> 01:33:25.164
Sorry.

01:33:25.295 --> 01:33:26.644
I'm sorry.

01:33:26.688 --> 01:33:28.559
You ran.

01:33:28.690 --> 01:33:29.908
You murdering bitch.

01:34:31.448 --> 01:34:33.668
What the fuck?

01:34:52.338 --> 01:34:53.339
Ah.

01:35:08.006 --> 01:35:10.269
Ah.

01:37:30.496 --> 01:37:31.715
She's back.

01:37:42.291 --> 01:37:44.075
She's back.

01:37:44.119 --> 01:37:45.033
Hello?

01:37:47.426 --> 01:37:48.645
How's your day going?

01:37:54.694 --> 01:37:57.001
You all right?

01:37:57.088 --> 01:37:59.438
What is this?

01:37:59.525 --> 01:38:00.570
I know you.

01:38:04.008 --> 01:38:04.879
You're Diane.

01:38:07.490 --> 01:38:09.448
Obviously.

01:39:00.064 --> 01:39:02.588
She killed you, too.

01:39:02.719 --> 01:39:05.896
Who are you talking about?

01:39:05.940 --> 01:39:09.291
She did, didn't she?

01:39:09.378 --> 01:39:11.815
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:39:11.902 --> 01:39:13.948
What's wrong, honey?

01:39:13.991 --> 01:39:17.952
Just left you
like everyone else.

01:39:18.082 --> 01:39:19.388
Who are you talking about?

01:39:21.738 --> 01:39:24.567
Catherine.

01:39:24.697 --> 01:39:27.309
Why did she do it?

01:39:27.396 --> 01:39:29.572
I just want us to be happy.

01:39:29.615 --> 01:39:31.704
It's okay what you do.

01:39:31.748 --> 01:39:33.576
I understand now.

01:39:33.663 --> 01:39:35.882
I want to help.

01:40:05.129 --> 01:40:06.087
Oh.

01:40:06.174 --> 01:40:07.479
Oh, god.

01:40:15.748 --> 01:40:16.706
Hey.

01:40:16.749 --> 01:40:18.186
Hey.

01:40:18.229 --> 01:40:19.709
Oh, fuck.

01:40:19.752 --> 01:40:20.710
Hey.

01:40:22.233 --> 01:40:23.147
Hey.

01:40:26.020 --> 01:40:28.065
You're gonna be okay.

01:40:28.196 --> 01:40:30.111
If I could-- ah.

01:40:30.198 --> 01:40:31.938
Hey, hey.

01:40:32.026 --> 01:40:34.506
You're gonna be okay.

01:40:34.593 --> 01:40:37.770
She's-- she's gone.

01:40:37.901 --> 01:40:40.077
She's gone.

01:40:40.164 --> 01:40:41.383
You're safe.

01:40:41.513 --> 01:40:44.168
I just need to get
this-- oh, fuck.

01:40:44.299 --> 01:40:47.258
Let me get this off.

01:40:50.653 --> 01:40:51.697
There we go.

01:40:51.784 --> 01:40:52.785
You're safe.

01:40:52.829 --> 01:40:54.483
You're safe.

01:40:54.570 --> 01:40:57.094
I just gotta get you up here.

01:40:57.138 --> 01:40:58.313
Come on.

01:40:58.400 --> 01:40:59.531
There you go.
There we go.

01:40:59.618 --> 01:41:00.967
Oh my god.

01:41:01.098 --> 01:41:03.013
Oh, my god.

01:41:03.144 --> 01:41:04.449
You weren't kidding.

01:41:04.536 --> 01:41:05.972
She's nuts.
Oh, my god.

01:41:06.103 --> 01:41:07.452
Wake up.
There you are.

01:41:07.539 --> 01:41:08.497
Yeah.

01:41:08.540 --> 01:41:09.976
There you go.

01:41:10.020 --> 01:41:10.934
There you go.

01:41:11.021 --> 01:41:12.414
We're gonna be okay.

01:41:12.501 --> 01:41:14.242
Hey, you're gonna to be okay.

01:41:14.285 --> 01:41:18.985
Let me just-- no,
no, no, no, no.

01:41:19.116 --> 01:41:20.335
Stay.
Stay.

01:41:20.422 --> 01:41:22.206
You're gonna be okay.

01:41:22.293 --> 01:41:25.949
I just need-- Hey, I need your
phone so I can call someone.

01:41:27.081 --> 01:41:28.169
Fuck.

01:41:28.212 --> 01:41:31.259
I need to call someone Fuck.

01:41:31.346 --> 01:41:32.390
Oh.

01:41:32.477 --> 01:41:36.916
Oh my-- oh, fuck.

01:41:37.047 --> 01:41:39.441
Okay, I think she
missed my organs.

01:41:41.965 --> 01:41:43.227
You're right.

01:41:43.314 --> 01:41:44.402
She's a murderer.

01:41:44.533 --> 01:41:45.925
The cops will
know what to do.

01:41:51.105 --> 01:41:51.975
Yeah.

01:41:52.062 --> 01:41:54.151
Hey.

01:41:54.238 --> 01:41:55.718
You were right, too.

01:41:55.848 --> 01:41:58.416
You were right, too.

01:41:58.503 --> 01:42:01.027
She told me all these
things about you.

01:42:01.115 --> 01:42:03.682
She tried to get into my life.

01:42:03.769 --> 01:42:04.727
They'll arrest her.

01:42:04.857 --> 01:42:06.598
It needs to be public.

01:42:06.729 --> 01:42:11.037
It just doesn't make sense
why you pretended to-- oh.

01:42:11.081 --> 01:42:13.170
Oh, my stomach.

01:42:22.048 --> 01:42:23.093
Wait.

01:42:31.449 --> 01:42:33.147
Why were you
in my house last night?

01:42:48.423 --> 01:42:51.252
You like that,
you little bitch?

01:42:51.339 --> 01:42:52.862
You're pathetic.

01:43:02.959 --> 01:43:04.526
You broke in?

01:43:07.181 --> 01:43:12.490
I don't-- I don't understand.

01:43:12.577 --> 01:43:14.362
That's too bad.

01:43:18.931 --> 01:43:24.198
She killed you
and your girlfriend all

01:43:24.241 --> 01:43:26.330
because you poisoned the world.

01:43:26.417 --> 01:43:28.245
Her words, not mine.

01:43:28.332 --> 01:43:29.725
I'm starting to agree.

01:43:31.988 --> 01:43:34.425
You're a cancer.

01:43:34.469 --> 01:43:40.344
And sometimes there
needs to be someone

01:43:40.475 --> 01:43:41.867
who cuts the cancer out.

01:44:11.157 --> 01:44:12.115
Madison!

01:44:14.248 --> 01:44:15.945
You can come out now.

01:44:18.643 --> 01:44:19.688
Madison!

01:44:39.708 --> 01:44:42.493
We all up late out here.

01:44:46.062 --> 01:44:47.803
Fake and gay.

01:44:47.846 --> 01:44:48.847
Wait.

01:44:48.934 --> 01:44:51.502
What the actual fuck?

01:44:51.589 --> 01:44:53.722
Who's the dead girl?

01:44:53.852 --> 01:44:55.637
This is fucked up.

01:44:55.767 --> 01:44:58.117
Did she actually
just murder Jacob?

01:44:58.204 --> 01:44:59.249
Holy shit.

01:44:59.336 --> 01:45:01.251
Step on me, Mommy.

01:45:01.382 --> 01:45:03.645
Jacob deserved it.

01:45:03.732 --> 01:45:05.777
I'm in love.

01:45:05.821 --> 01:45:07.823
Girl, you fine as hell.

01:45:07.910 --> 01:45:08.867
Jacob is a good boy.

01:45:08.954 --> 01:45:09.825
Fact.

01:45:09.955 --> 01:45:11.566
She's a goddess.

01:45:11.696 --> 01:45:13.350
Incredible.

01:45:13.437 --> 01:45:15.091
This is why.

01:45:15.178 --> 01:45:16.571
Jacob can burn in hell.

01:45:16.658 --> 01:45:17.659
Hot.

01:45:21.271 --> 01:45:22.316
I see you.

01:45:25.580 --> 01:45:26.755
I would risk it.

01:45:30.193 --> 01:45:31.368
He let me down.

01:45:31.412 --> 01:45:32.326
Frown.

01:45:38.636 --> 01:45:40.377
Goodbye, Diane.

01:45:40.464 --> 01:45:42.901
Goodbye, Madison.

01:46:15.456 --> 01:46:17.893
Does she have an OnlyFans?

01:46:18.023 --> 01:46:21.157
I bet she's a killer
in the sheets, too.

01:46:21.244 --> 01:46:24.378
What's your name?

01:46:24.465 --> 01:46:26.031
I'm in love.

01:46:32.429 --> 01:46:34.475
At first, I was upset, but
then I remembered that there's

01:46:34.518 --> 01:46:36.041
no such thing as bad press.

01:46:36.128 --> 01:46:37.869
And it's actually genius
if you think about it

01:46:37.956 --> 01:46:39.567
because I've never heard
of a single public figure who

01:46:39.654 --> 01:46:41.264
had a sex tape that
hurt their career.

01:46:41.351 --> 01:46:43.309
In fact, sex tapes
help careers.

01:46:43.440 --> 01:46:44.876
They elevate careers,
and all he has to do

01:46:45.007 --> 01:46:46.400
is do a little
bit of a rebrand.

01:46:46.443 --> 01:46:47.662
And if he pitches
that correctly,

01:46:47.749 --> 01:46:49.664
then this is
a fantastic opportunity.

01:46:54.059 --> 01:46:55.234
What the fuck?

01:47:04.156 --> 01:47:05.680
