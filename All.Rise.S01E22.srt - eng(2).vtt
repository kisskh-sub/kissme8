00:01:48.808 --> 00:01:50.024
(Talent Hunt Program Day 79)

00:01:50.024 --> 00:01:52.040
(Guo Xiaoyu 3, Yan Fei 2)

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.024
(Ren Jiatong 1, Jiang Chen 1)

00:01:55.362 --> 00:01:57.803
These are surveillance images
of our client Xia Jun

00:01:57.803 --> 00:01:59.083
(Surveillance image)
meeting with

00:01:59.083 --> 00:02:00.963
the opposing party's representative.

00:02:01.243 --> 00:02:03.402
I've also extracted a surveillance clip.

00:02:04.202 --> 00:02:05.523
While drafting the report,

00:02:05.683 --> 00:02:07.523
I noticed that their representative

00:02:07.723 --> 00:02:09.443
claimed to have brought Xia Jun

00:02:09.603 --> 00:02:10.843
two million cash,

00:02:11.123 --> 00:02:12.283
packed in this tennis bag.

00:02:13.962 --> 00:02:15.482
(Two million cash)
The weight of two million cash

00:02:15.482 --> 00:02:17.682
depends on the bill denominations.

00:02:17.682 --> 00:02:19.883
In 100-yuan bills,

00:02:20.003 --> 00:02:22.202
it would weigh
approximately 23 kilograms.

00:02:22.603 --> 00:02:23.642
For comparison,

00:02:23.642 --> 00:02:25.522
standard water dispenser bottles

00:02:25.723 --> 00:02:27.603
weigh between 18 and 20 kilograms.

00:02:27.603 --> 00:02:29.522
Therefore, that cash would be heavier

00:02:29.563 --> 00:02:30.843
than a full bottle of water.

00:02:30.843 --> 00:02:32.443
It's hard to imagine anyone

00:02:32.443 --> 00:02:33.843
carrying it with one hand

00:02:33.843 --> 00:02:35.682
as Xia Jun did in the footage.

00:02:36.082 --> 00:02:37.043
Interesting angle.

00:02:37.723 --> 00:02:38.603
How did you

00:02:38.603 --> 00:02:39.922
think of the weight?

00:02:40.443 --> 00:02:41.843
Since we rarely use cash now,

00:02:42.003 --> 00:02:43.563
we don't instinctively know

00:02:43.563 --> 00:02:45.283
how heavy that much cash is.

00:02:45.928 --> 00:02:46.522
Well done.

00:02:47.202 --> 00:02:48.482
Credit goes to Guo Xiaoyu.

00:02:50.802 --> 00:02:53.323
I once won a Hanfu culture competition,

00:02:53.323 --> 00:02:54.403
taking first place.

00:02:54.682 --> 00:02:55.922
It was my first-ever award,

00:02:55.922 --> 00:02:56.843
so I was thrilled.

00:02:56.922 --> 00:02:58.522
I cashed out a good few thousand

00:02:58.522 --> 00:02:59.642
of the prize money.

00:03:00.003 --> 00:03:01.202
But the bills don't fit

00:03:01.202 --> 00:03:02.163
in my tiny purse.

00:03:02.202 --> 00:03:03.883
Plus, it was noticeably heavy.

00:03:04.323 --> 00:03:05.802
Now imagine two million.

00:03:06.202 --> 00:03:07.362
The bag would bulge

00:03:07.362 --> 00:03:09.362
if it were filled with cash,

00:03:09.443 --> 00:03:10.443
and it'd be heavy.

00:03:10.883 --> 00:03:12.323
I just mumbled the thought.

00:03:12.323 --> 00:03:14.482
Ren Jiatong developed the full argument.

00:03:18.163 --> 00:03:19.762
So what was in that bag?

00:03:20.082 --> 00:03:22.283
Xia Jun said
it was just a tennis racket.

00:03:22.563 --> 00:03:23.563
Supposedly,

00:03:23.563 --> 00:03:25.403
both she and Gao Lang love tennis.

00:03:25.522 --> 00:03:27.283
So they gave her a casual gift.

00:03:27.843 --> 00:03:28.603
Xia Jun said

00:03:28.603 --> 00:03:29.962
she initially declined,

00:03:30.202 --> 00:03:32.202
but accepted it to avoid awkwardness.

00:03:32.403 --> 00:03:33.443
She planned to

00:03:33.723 --> 00:03:35.283
give an equivalent gift in return.

00:03:35.802 --> 00:03:37.922
Gifts below a certain value

00:03:37.922 --> 00:03:39.443
are normal professional courtesies

00:03:39.563 --> 00:03:41.123
and don't violate company policy.

00:03:42.443 --> 00:03:44.082
I just don't understand.

00:03:44.362 --> 00:03:46.403
Why would that guy try

00:03:46.403 --> 00:03:47.323
to frame Xia Jun?

00:03:48.202 --> 00:03:49.603
He probably knew about

00:03:49.603 --> 00:03:50.603
the investigation

00:03:50.603 --> 00:03:51.603
and couldn't cover it up.

00:03:51.603 --> 00:03:52.883
So he implicated someone

00:03:52.883 --> 00:03:55.123
from a partner company,

00:03:55.202 --> 00:03:56.482
hoping both companies

00:03:56.482 --> 00:03:57.922
would quietly settle things

00:03:57.922 --> 00:03:59.323
to protect shared interests.

00:03:59.723 --> 00:04:01.362
My brother told me similar cases

00:04:01.443 --> 00:04:02.323
he'd seen before.

00:04:06.802 --> 00:04:08.283
Let's stop here for now.

00:04:08.723 --> 00:04:09.563
I've been observing

00:04:09.563 --> 00:04:11.082
and documenting your work.

00:04:11.883 --> 00:04:12.642
Everyone

00:04:12.802 --> 00:04:13.802
showed unique strengths.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.680
I'll share these notes
with your supervising lawyers.

00:04:17.002 --> 00:04:18.603
They'll give you scores

00:04:18.682 --> 00:04:20.002
based on individual performance

00:04:20.163 --> 00:04:21.242
and teamwork.

00:04:21.603 --> 00:04:23.043
Go back to your seats

00:04:23.163 --> 00:04:24.442
and polish your reports.

00:04:24.482 --> 00:04:26.682
Let's meet at 5 PM once Ms. Bai is back

00:04:26.843 --> 00:04:27.922
from the client meeting.

00:04:28.163 --> 00:04:28.843
Work hard.

00:04:29.163 --> 00:04:31.203
Your score depends on the presentation.

00:04:40.523 --> 00:04:41.043
Jiatong.

00:04:41.963 --> 00:04:42.603
Are you okay?

00:04:44.682 --> 00:04:45.603
Of course.

00:04:48.043 --> 00:04:48.643
Just working.

00:04:49.763 --> 00:04:51.322
I'll refine our report.

00:04:51.442 --> 00:04:53.043
We'll crush them this afternoon.

00:04:54.562 --> 00:04:55.643
I thought...

00:04:57.763 --> 00:04:58.283
Alright then.

00:04:59.122 --> 00:05:01.002
I'll earn bonus points with Mr. Song.

00:05:01.362 --> 00:05:02.482
He has a client meeting.

00:05:02.482 --> 00:05:04.043
I'll try to assist him.

00:05:05.083 --> 00:05:05.763
Go ahead.

00:05:06.322 --> 00:05:07.482
I'll handle the report.

00:05:07.482 --> 00:05:08.562
We'll present it together.

00:05:09.122 --> 00:05:10.283
Love you, Jiatong.

00:05:10.723 --> 00:05:11.802
Come back before 5 PM.

00:05:12.263 --> 00:05:12.833
Okay.

00:05:21.723 --> 00:05:24.643
Mentor, you're such a great driver.

00:05:24.882 --> 00:05:25.802
I was worried that

00:05:26.002 --> 00:05:27.963
I'd miss the meeting with Ms. Bai.

00:05:28.083 --> 00:05:30.002
We actually make it back in time.

00:05:30.322 --> 00:05:31.122
I have to say,

00:05:31.403 --> 00:05:32.763
you're a walking map of Beijing.

00:05:32.922 --> 00:05:35.043
You know every alley that's passable.

00:05:35.242 --> 00:05:36.442
I'm impressed.

00:05:36.723 --> 00:05:37.283
Enough.

00:05:37.843 --> 00:05:39.163
Your flattery is deafening.

00:05:39.163 --> 00:05:40.322
You're up to no good.

00:05:41.128 --> 00:05:41.723
Spit it out.

00:05:42.163 --> 00:05:43.322
You got me wrong.

00:05:43.322 --> 00:05:45.482
A little kitten can't harbor
any bad intentions.

00:05:45.922 --> 00:05:47.963
I think I'll do well, partnering

00:05:47.963 --> 00:05:49.322
with Ren Jiatong this round.

00:05:49.723 --> 00:05:51.882
I didn't do well
in the previous rounds...

00:05:54.024 --> 00:05:54.694
Let's go.

00:05:56.922 --> 00:05:58.002
Did you enjoy the meal?

00:05:59.922 --> 00:06:01.122
Isn't this Ms. Bai?

00:06:04.603 --> 00:06:05.224
Bye.

00:06:12.442 --> 00:06:12.963
Mr. Song.

00:06:13.576 --> 00:06:14.322
Long time no see.

00:06:14.322 --> 00:06:15.688
(Gao Lang, Client of Xia Jun's case)

00:06:19.752 --> 00:06:20.264
Let's go.

00:06:29.352 --> 00:06:30.002
Ms. Bai.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:31.963
The client drove you back.

00:06:31.963 --> 00:06:34.122
I guess your meeting went smoothly.

00:06:35.242 --> 00:06:35.843
Yeah.

00:06:37.763 --> 00:06:38.362
Did they pay?

00:06:38.696 --> 00:06:39.283
Yeah.

00:06:40.083 --> 00:06:42.122
Gao Lang wired
the full amount on day one.

00:06:43.523 --> 00:06:44.322
Good for him.

00:06:45.922 --> 00:06:46.922
A mid-level lawyer

00:06:46.922 --> 00:06:48.242
could've handled

00:06:48.242 --> 00:06:49.122
such a minor matter.

00:06:49.562 --> 00:06:50.882
But you stepped in.

00:06:51.242 --> 00:06:52.523
We should triple the fee.

00:06:55.122 --> 00:06:56.643
We have a reporting session

00:06:56.643 --> 00:06:57.523
in five minutes.

00:06:57.922 --> 00:06:59.163
Care to offer some guidance?

00:06:59.464 --> 00:07:00.083
Sure.

00:07:01.083 --> 00:07:02.322
Guo Xiaoyu will present too.

00:07:02.682 --> 00:07:04.283
I must attend the meeting.

00:07:21.242 --> 00:07:23.763
Here are the conclusions
Guo Xiaoyu and I reached.

00:07:24.163 --> 00:07:27.043
First, Xia Jun admits
that she recommended the inclusion

00:07:27.043 --> 00:07:29.523
of an outsourced
software company as requested.

00:07:29.843 --> 00:07:30.723
But Xia Jun's company

00:07:30.723 --> 00:07:32.283
merely provides suggestions.

00:07:32.403 --> 00:07:34.283
They can't decide what the client does

00:07:34.283 --> 00:07:35.963
or who the client hires.

00:07:36.122 --> 00:07:37.723
Second, surveillance footage confirms

00:07:37.723 --> 00:07:39.242
that the two indeed met.

00:07:39.322 --> 00:07:41.002
That person gave Xia Jun a tennis bag.

00:07:41.002 --> 00:07:43.203
But it can't prove
that she received two million

00:07:43.203 --> 00:07:44.122
or that "money"

00:07:44.122 --> 00:07:46.603
was related to the recommendation

00:07:46.603 --> 00:07:47.963
of outsourcing the work.

00:07:48.963 --> 00:07:49.922
Thirdly,

00:07:49.922 --> 00:07:50.802
we've analyzed

00:07:50.802 --> 00:07:52.723
the weight of two million cash.

00:07:53.163 --> 00:07:54.163
We believe

00:07:54.163 --> 00:07:55.682
the tennis bag contains

00:07:55.802 --> 00:07:57.603
a tennis racket,
not cash, as Xia Jun stated.

00:08:02.536 --> 00:08:03.080
Ms. Bai.

00:08:10.283 --> 00:08:11.963
There's nothing between them.

00:08:12.723 --> 00:08:14.122
I asked Yan Fei in secret.

00:08:14.482 --> 00:08:15.882
My deduction was wrong.

00:08:16.763 --> 00:08:18.083
Yan Fei told you to tell me?

00:08:19.496 --> 00:08:20.122
Focus.

00:08:20.682 --> 00:08:22.163
Please check the document in hand.

00:08:22.163 --> 00:08:23.403
There's an image

00:08:23.403 --> 00:08:25.163
of a phone sealed in a plastic bag.

00:08:25.482 --> 00:08:26.922
This phone belongs to Xia Jun.

00:08:27.002 --> 00:08:28.442
(Phone in plastic bag)
Days ago,

00:08:28.442 --> 00:08:29.384
I had some tech experts

00:08:29.384 --> 00:08:31.682
seal up it at a certified institution.

00:08:31.682 --> 00:08:33.003
It's proven that

00:08:33.003 --> 00:08:34.682
no system or software inside

00:08:34.682 --> 00:08:36.202
was tampered with.

00:08:37.922 --> 00:08:38.763
This photo shows

00:08:38.763 --> 00:08:40.082
Xia Jun's movement track

00:08:40.082 --> 00:08:41.483
recorded by her phone.

00:08:41.682 --> 00:08:43.283
(Movement track)
The other party mentioned

00:08:43.283 --> 00:08:45.082
several meetings with Xia Jun.

00:08:45.403 --> 00:08:46.802
Based on her movement track,

00:08:46.842 --> 00:08:48.123
the distance between locations

00:08:48.163 --> 00:08:49.763
couldn't be covered within an hour,

00:08:49.763 --> 00:08:51.602
regardless of the transportation method.

00:08:51.842 --> 00:08:53.763
Unless she had a helicopter.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:57.544
Good.

00:08:58.922 --> 00:09:00.322
Everyone did quite well.

00:09:00.802 --> 00:09:02.483
We will discuss

00:09:02.483 --> 00:09:04.043
your ranking and scoring details

00:09:04.403 --> 00:09:05.202
and notify you

00:09:05.643 --> 00:09:07.082
of the final results via email.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:09.893
(Talent Hunt Program Candidates
Ranking of Assessment, Round 6)

00:09:09.893 --> 00:09:10.891
(1st Place: Ren Jiatong,
Round Score 20, Total 145)

00:09:10.891 --> 00:09:11.787
(1st Place: Jiang Chen,
Round Score 20, Total 145)

00:09:11.787 --> 00:09:12.843
(2nd Place: Guo Xiaoyu,
Round Score 30, Total 140)

00:09:12.843 --> 00:09:13.931
(2nd Place: Yan Fei,
Round Score 20, Total 140)

00:09:15.722 --> 00:09:17.163
The parking lot was

00:09:17.163 --> 00:09:18.216
a major battlefield.

00:09:18.216 --> 00:09:19.944
The tension in the air was thick.

00:09:19.944 --> 00:09:21.442
I nearly became collateral damage.

00:09:21.842 --> 00:09:24.883
That could easily make the top three
most embarrassing moments

00:09:25.243 --> 00:09:25.842
in my life.

00:09:26.883 --> 00:09:28.243
I genuinely feel for my mentor.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:29.442
But

00:09:29.883 --> 00:09:31.363
Gao Lang is so handsome.

00:09:31.643 --> 00:09:33.283
I'm actually starting to waver.

00:09:33.602 --> 00:09:35.043
Isn't Mr. Song your mentor?

00:09:35.043 --> 00:09:36.483
You switched sides way too fast.

00:09:36.802 --> 00:09:37.442
Shame on you.

00:09:38.243 --> 00:09:39.842
I firmly support Mr. Song.

00:09:40.523 --> 00:09:41.483
Don't say that.

00:09:42.163 --> 00:09:42.842
I should've

00:09:43.043 --> 00:09:44.682
stood firmly by my mentor's side

00:09:44.682 --> 00:09:46.403
based on emotion, logic, or even looks.

00:09:46.842 --> 00:09:49.123
But now there's new drama.

00:09:51.912 --> 00:09:54.888
Gao Lang is single.

00:09:56.043 --> 00:09:56.842
Come on.

00:09:57.123 --> 00:09:58.403
He's helping his girlfriend.

00:09:58.602 --> 00:09:59.163
No.

00:09:59.722 --> 00:10:00.403
Not "girlfriend".

00:10:00.682 --> 00:10:01.682
Ex-girlfriend.

00:10:02.163 --> 00:10:03.643
And why did he specifically

00:10:03.643 --> 00:10:04.562
go to Ms. Bai?

00:10:04.922 --> 00:10:06.442
He was telling Ms. Bai,

00:10:06.802 --> 00:10:08.243
"I'm single now."

00:10:08.602 --> 00:10:09.602
"And you tied up

00:10:09.602 --> 00:10:10.922
the loose end

00:10:11.123 --> 00:10:13.003
of this relationship for me."

00:10:13.442 --> 00:10:15.283
"I've completely cut ties."

00:10:15.643 --> 00:10:17.322
He's broadcasting loudly

00:10:17.322 --> 00:10:18.202
to inform Ms. Bai,

00:10:18.682 --> 00:10:20.883
"I've regained the right

00:10:20.883 --> 00:10:21.962
to pursue you."

00:10:22.523 --> 00:10:24.682
Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant.

00:10:25.763 --> 00:10:27.483
I'm worried for my mentor.

00:10:27.802 --> 00:10:28.643
He might lose.

00:10:29.763 --> 00:10:32.523
Gao Lang seems quite decent.

00:10:32.763 --> 00:10:33.483
Mr. Song said

00:10:33.722 --> 00:10:35.283
he'd follow his heart

00:10:35.682 --> 00:10:36.922
and wouldn't have regrets.

00:10:37.288 --> 00:10:37.962
No.

00:10:38.722 --> 00:10:41.123
Their generation
is really hung up on relationships.

00:10:41.363 --> 00:10:42.523
Haven't you heard?

00:10:42.883 --> 00:10:45.123
Our firm prohibits workplace romances.

00:10:46.562 --> 00:10:48.763
But junior lawyers do get

00:10:48.802 --> 00:10:49.922
some leeway.

00:10:50.243 --> 00:10:51.682
It's only strictly enforced

00:10:51.722 --> 00:10:52.922
for partners.

00:10:53.322 --> 00:10:54.763
One must leave.

00:10:56.322 --> 00:10:58.883
But I found out something else.

00:10:59.523 --> 00:11:00.523
Ms. Bai

00:11:00.722 --> 00:11:02.922
submitted her resignation,
thinking that Mr. Song

00:11:02.962 --> 00:11:04.082
would leave with her.

00:11:04.602 --> 00:11:06.322
But Mr. Song thought

00:11:06.483 --> 00:11:08.363
Ms. Bai wouldn't leave Jun An with him.

00:11:08.363 --> 00:11:08.962
So he stayed.

00:11:09.243 --> 00:11:10.922
They never told each other

00:11:10.922 --> 00:11:12.003
what they truly wanted.

00:11:12.082 --> 00:11:14.202
They did what they thought
the other desired

00:11:14.523 --> 00:11:15.442
and drifted apart.

00:11:18.802 --> 00:11:20.483
My mentor is really in trouble.

00:11:28.202 --> 00:11:30.363
Mr. Song, did you need me?

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:30.950
No.

00:11:32.123 --> 00:11:33.322
I brought you bubble tea

00:11:33.322 --> 00:11:34.643
to go along with the meal.

00:11:35.602 --> 00:11:36.243
Be seated.

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:37.082
Go on.

00:11:37.403 --> 00:11:38.682
- Thank you, Mr. Song.
- Thank you, Mr. Song.

00:11:44.962 --> 00:11:45.483
Oh, no.

00:11:45.922 --> 00:11:48.003
I've completely offended my mentor.

00:11:48.763 --> 00:11:50.202
How much did he hear?

00:11:50.962 --> 00:11:53.442
Everything since
"Gao Lang is so handsome."

00:11:55.562 --> 00:11:57.602
He definitely saw our top-notch gossiper

00:11:57.682 --> 00:11:59.082
in all her glory.

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:09.000
(Office)

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:09.523
Jiang Chen.

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:10.682
Mr. Song.

00:12:12.104 --> 00:12:12.962
Printing something.

00:12:13.082 --> 00:12:14.003
Did we upset you

00:12:14.922 --> 00:12:15.722
earlier?

00:12:16.682 --> 00:12:17.322
Not at all.

00:12:18.043 --> 00:12:19.523
Girls love to gossip when together.

00:12:19.562 --> 00:12:20.283
I'm used to it.

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:21.283
Go home.

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:33.928
(Got a minute? Let's talk.)

00:12:41.082 --> 00:12:43.163
I didn't expect you to reach out first.

00:12:43.682 --> 00:12:45.123
Actually, I was about to text you

00:12:45.123 --> 00:12:46.163
when you texted me.

00:12:47.043 --> 00:12:48.883
What I said was...

00:12:49.322 --> 00:12:49.842
Jiang Chen.

00:12:51.043 --> 00:12:51.562
I'm sorry.

00:12:52.363 --> 00:12:53.523
I went too far

00:12:54.163 --> 00:12:55.003
yesterday.

00:12:55.363 --> 00:12:56.043
I was wrong too.

00:12:56.962 --> 00:12:58.243
Yesterday was my dad's birthday.

00:12:58.243 --> 00:12:59.322
I wasn't in a good mood.

00:13:00.283 --> 00:13:01.722
There are things I can't overcome.

00:13:01.722 --> 00:13:02.883
But I shouldn't have

00:13:03.763 --> 00:13:04.962
lashed out at you.

00:13:07.802 --> 00:13:09.243
Will you accept my apology?

00:13:11.976 --> 00:13:12.883
It's not your fault.

00:13:14.123 --> 00:13:14.643
Really.

00:13:16.562 --> 00:13:17.763
Even if it were your fault,

00:13:17.763 --> 00:13:19.802
I'd never let a lady apologize first.

00:13:20.264 --> 00:13:21.802
Whoever is at fault should apologize.

00:13:23.123 --> 00:13:25.483
Besides, we'll be working as lawyers.

00:13:25.704 --> 00:13:27.643
It's about using our brains
to solve problems

00:13:27.643 --> 00:13:28.403
and our words

00:13:28.403 --> 00:13:30.403
to clarify misunderstandings, right?

00:13:31.043 --> 00:13:34.163
So, I don't want you to leave like this.

00:13:35.602 --> 00:13:38.082
You want to prove yourself to your dad.

00:13:38.802 --> 00:13:40.523
I don't want you to give that up for me.

00:13:41.082 --> 00:13:42.802
My goal is to stay at Jun An.

00:13:43.243 --> 00:13:45.202
I won't give up my dream for you either.

00:13:47.403 --> 00:13:48.763
I wasn't planning to quit.

00:13:50.643 --> 00:13:51.403
I just don't

00:13:53.082 --> 00:13:54.483
want to end up like Mr. Song

00:13:55.523 --> 00:13:56.962
and Ms. Bai, who became partners

00:13:56.962 --> 00:13:57.523
but then

00:13:58.322 --> 00:13:59.643
lost what truly matters.

00:14:02.163 --> 00:14:03.322
I've thought this through.

00:14:04.802 --> 00:14:05.643
I want to win.

00:14:07.003 --> 00:14:09.602
But if that means losing you,

00:14:09.842 --> 00:14:10.523
then no.

00:14:11.003 --> 00:14:12.403
A win like that means nothing.

00:14:13.202 --> 00:14:14.163
But our generation

00:14:14.163 --> 00:14:15.442
is different from theirs.

00:14:15.962 --> 00:14:16.562
Likewise,

00:14:17.082 --> 00:14:18.643
I wouldn't be happy if you

00:14:18.643 --> 00:14:19.602
made that choice.

00:14:19.962 --> 00:14:22.403
I'd actually be disappointed

00:14:22.483 --> 00:14:23.442
if you

00:14:23.643 --> 00:14:24.643
went easy on me.

00:14:25.363 --> 00:14:26.363
Do you understand?

00:14:30.403 --> 00:14:31.682
I wasn't going easy on you.

00:14:33.163 --> 00:14:34.562
I simply made a choice

00:14:35.322 --> 00:14:36.163
to prioritize

00:14:36.922 --> 00:14:38.363
what felt more important.

00:14:40.082 --> 00:14:41.123
But along the way,

00:14:41.123 --> 00:14:42.322
I hurt your pride.

00:14:44.123 --> 00:14:45.243
Please believe me.

00:14:46.202 --> 00:14:47.243
It wasn't my intention.

00:14:48.616 --> 00:14:49.243
I'm sorry.

00:14:50.082 --> 00:14:50.922
I overreacted.

00:14:53.523 --> 00:14:54.523
Anyway,

00:14:57.763 --> 00:14:59.202
thank you for talking to me.

00:14:59.962 --> 00:15:00.842
Rest assured.

00:15:01.962 --> 00:15:03.043
I won't hold back.

00:15:03.962 --> 00:15:05.363
Even if I lose,

00:15:05.363 --> 00:15:06.363
I'll have places to go

00:15:06.363 --> 00:15:07.842
with my qualifications.

00:15:08.483 --> 00:15:09.243
Bring it on.

00:15:11.403 --> 00:15:13.202
Focus on staying in the game first.

00:15:13.682 --> 00:15:14.922
That photo of you and Yan Fei

00:15:14.922 --> 00:15:16.003
is still online.

00:15:16.243 --> 00:15:16.922
You're jealous?

00:15:17.192 --> 00:15:17.722
Sorry.

00:15:18.363 --> 00:15:19.562
When I saw that photo,

00:15:19.562 --> 00:15:22.082
I went from angry to calm in 30 seconds.

00:15:23.802 --> 00:15:25.643
Doesn't it feel very fishy?

00:15:26.403 --> 00:15:28.322
Let's say that the woman told the truth.

00:15:28.682 --> 00:15:30.922
She lost contact with Yan Da
after returning to China,

00:15:31.483 --> 00:15:32.922
and then confronted Yan Fei.

00:15:33.283 --> 00:15:34.082
Then she snapped

00:15:34.082 --> 00:15:35.322
a photo of you two.

00:15:36.562 --> 00:15:37.682
Doesn't it sound

00:15:38.243 --> 00:15:39.602
all too convenient?

00:15:40.682 --> 00:15:41.562
Yan Fei found

00:15:41.562 --> 00:15:43.602
the coffee shop she usually visits.

00:15:44.883 --> 00:15:47.483
Why don't we talk to her tomorrow?

00:15:48.442 --> 00:15:49.763
You've already planned this.

00:15:50.082 --> 00:15:51.363
You're just informing me.

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:52.400
Clever.

00:15:52.802 --> 00:15:54.082
Women move fast.

00:15:54.763 --> 00:15:57.602
Your resilience is way too impressive.

00:15:57.802 --> 00:15:59.163
Do you actually like me?

00:16:00.562 --> 00:16:02.043
You're still thinking about that?

00:16:02.442 --> 00:16:04.043
I bet you haven't been focused on work.

00:16:06.403 --> 00:16:07.602
Tomorrow at 10 AM.

00:16:07.842 --> 00:16:08.922
I'll text you the address.

00:16:10.088 --> 00:16:10.888
As always,

00:16:10.888 --> 00:16:12.082
come up after five minutes.

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:13.190
Okay.

00:16:47.845 --> 00:16:48.360
Hello.

00:16:48.456 --> 00:16:49.523
Jiang Chen, come back.

00:16:49.763 --> 00:16:50.722
Yan Da is in trouble.

00:16:56.163 --> 00:16:57.643
Here's the thing.

00:16:58.043 --> 00:16:58.962
My brother has been

00:16:58.962 --> 00:17:00.643
out of reach for days.

00:17:01.163 --> 00:17:03.082
Late last night, we got word

00:17:03.082 --> 00:17:05.162
that local police secretly took him away

00:17:05.162 --> 00:17:06.082
for questioning.

00:17:06.523 --> 00:17:07.283
As the head

00:17:07.283 --> 00:17:09.283
of Xingke Group, he's suspected

00:17:09.562 --> 00:17:11.283
of infringing upon the business secrets

00:17:11.283 --> 00:17:12.602
of a local major company.

00:17:13.162 --> 00:17:14.562
That company is Xingke's

00:17:14.562 --> 00:17:16.402
biggest competitor in the market.

00:17:16.562 --> 00:17:17.602
We've paid the bail.

00:17:17.723 --> 00:17:18.723
He's safe now.

00:17:19.043 --> 00:17:21.283
But his freedom will be limited for now.

00:17:22.122 --> 00:17:23.523
However, they're also

00:17:23.523 --> 00:17:25.562
suing Xingke
for patent infringement in China.

00:17:26.082 --> 00:17:28.362
I've discussed with my family
and our Legal Director.

00:17:28.723 --> 00:17:29.723
We want to entrust

00:17:29.723 --> 00:17:31.122
this case to Jun An.

00:17:32.523 --> 00:17:33.322
No problem.

00:17:33.523 --> 00:17:34.602
I'll work with Ms. Bai.

00:17:35.624 --> 00:17:37.122
I'll handle the patent infringement.

00:17:37.523 --> 00:17:38.923
Ms. Bai will handle your brother's

00:17:39.003 --> 00:17:39.963
legal proceedings.

00:17:42.248 --> 00:17:42.842
Yan Fei.

00:17:43.683 --> 00:17:44.602
You look pale.

00:17:45.243 --> 00:17:45.963
Are you okay?

00:17:47.523 --> 00:17:48.162
I'm fine.

00:17:49.523 --> 00:17:53.642
But my dad had a stroke
and he's in the hospital.

00:17:54.322 --> 00:17:55.683
My mom is staying with him.

00:17:56.763 --> 00:17:58.763
I don't know
how my brother is doing overseas.

00:17:59.882 --> 00:18:00.923
I can't tell

00:18:01.043 --> 00:18:02.842
how long the investigation will take.

00:18:04.003 --> 00:18:05.243
So I can't break down.

00:18:11.923 --> 00:18:13.683
Take it if you need to.

00:18:15.784 --> 00:18:16.360
Mr. Song.

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:17.243
Ms. Bai.

00:18:18.723 --> 00:18:20.283
Someone has to hold things together

00:18:20.483 --> 00:18:21.243
at home.

00:18:22.483 --> 00:18:23.402
Therefore, I've decided

00:18:27.402 --> 00:18:28.283
to withdraw from

00:18:28.923 --> 00:18:29.963
the Talent Hunt Program.

00:18:31.562 --> 00:18:33.602
Let's do something to help Fei.

00:18:34.043 --> 00:18:35.443
She's close to her brother.

00:18:35.723 --> 00:18:37.483
She must be devastated right now.

00:18:40.642 --> 00:18:41.963
I researched some cases online.

00:18:42.082 --> 00:18:42.963
The best approach

00:18:43.082 --> 00:18:43.963
is to prove

00:18:43.963 --> 00:18:45.523
that their claimed

00:18:45.602 --> 00:18:47.043
infringed patent is invalid.

00:18:47.443 --> 00:18:49.362
I've contacted my overseas classmates

00:18:49.402 --> 00:18:51.003
and friends in the semiconductor field.

00:18:51.362 --> 00:18:52.283
Let's see if we can

00:18:52.283 --> 00:18:53.602
find anything useful.

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:55.240
- I'll help you.
- Jiang Chen.

00:18:55.602 --> 00:18:57.402
Remember that photo of you and Yan Fei

00:18:57.483 --> 00:18:59.082
I mentioned yesterday?

00:18:59.362 --> 00:19:01.322
It looks like a setup.

00:19:01.642 --> 00:19:03.602
Do you think this woman
came to ask for money

00:19:03.882 --> 00:19:05.082
because someone sent her?

00:19:05.322 --> 00:19:06.963
And this person knows Yan Da?

00:19:09.362 --> 00:19:10.963
That woman is named Zhang Xiaomei.

00:19:11.162 --> 00:19:12.162
She's an influencer.

00:19:12.562 --> 00:19:14.443
We can check her Weibo

00:19:14.443 --> 00:19:16.562
and other social media for clues.

00:19:16.963 --> 00:19:18.842
But according to Yan Fei,

00:19:19.322 --> 00:19:21.283
this woman genuinely
has feelings for Yan Da.

00:19:21.483 --> 00:19:23.082
Money is just a smokescreen.

00:19:23.243 --> 00:19:24.802
She just wants Yan Da to show up.

00:19:25.683 --> 00:19:27.243
If Yan Fei says so,

00:19:27.322 --> 00:19:28.443
it must be true.

00:19:28.923 --> 00:19:29.523
We girls

00:19:29.523 --> 00:19:31.243
can feel those things instantly.

00:19:31.243 --> 00:19:31.963
It can't be faked.

00:19:33.402 --> 00:19:34.523
Let's look into her Weibo,

00:19:34.523 --> 00:19:35.602
Douyin, and RedNote

00:19:35.642 --> 00:19:37.122
to see if we can find something.

00:20:03.963 --> 00:20:04.763
You'd better

00:20:05.243 --> 00:20:05.963
not have coffee.

00:20:06.443 --> 00:20:07.842
Mr. Zhou, want some advice?

00:20:08.963 --> 00:20:10.203
Don't casually advise others.

00:20:14.362 --> 00:20:15.443
I know you're worried.

00:20:15.882 --> 00:20:16.923
Your brother is stranded.

00:20:17.523 --> 00:20:18.483
Your dad is unwell.

00:20:19.683 --> 00:20:21.602
You're heavily burdened right now.

00:20:22.243 --> 00:20:22.842
I know

00:20:23.763 --> 00:20:24.723
you're stressed.

00:20:28.003 --> 00:20:28.562
I'm okay.

00:20:30.243 --> 00:20:31.443
I'm just sad for my brother.

00:20:32.283 --> 00:20:32.963
You were right.

00:20:34.003 --> 00:20:35.483
He's only in his thirties.

00:20:36.243 --> 00:20:37.483
How did he shoulder

00:20:37.483 --> 00:20:38.362
so much alone?

00:20:41.483 --> 00:20:43.082
My father fell seriously ill years ago

00:20:43.723 --> 00:20:45.402
and stepped back from company affairs.

00:20:46.122 --> 00:20:47.642
Then my brother joined Xingke.

00:20:48.523 --> 00:20:49.802
He was just 28 then

00:20:50.802 --> 00:20:52.043
and had just been accepted

00:20:52.043 --> 00:20:53.723
to a sociology PhD program in the UK.

00:20:54.283 --> 00:20:55.283
But he gave it up.

00:20:56.443 --> 00:20:58.723
He never complained about it.

00:21:00.082 --> 00:21:01.203
All these years,

00:21:01.322 --> 00:21:03.523
I've been trying to oppose him.

00:21:05.683 --> 00:21:06.802
But you know what?

00:21:06.802 --> 00:21:08.602
We never once fought growing up.

00:21:09.203 --> 00:21:11.082
He's never once lost his temper with me.

00:21:14.283 --> 00:21:15.802
No matter what trouble I face,

00:21:16.082 --> 00:21:18.203
he immediately drops whatever he's doing

00:21:18.203 --> 00:21:19.162
to help me.

00:21:19.963 --> 00:21:21.483
But after I got hurt in my last

00:21:22.082 --> 00:21:23.082
relationship,

00:21:23.723 --> 00:21:25.362
he became super protective.

00:21:25.523 --> 00:21:26.882
Because he felt for me.

00:21:29.283 --> 00:21:30.923
He's been protecting me

00:21:30.923 --> 00:21:32.243
all along.

00:21:33.642 --> 00:21:34.203
This time,

00:21:35.402 --> 00:21:36.882
I'd like to protect him.

00:21:40.082 --> 00:21:41.763
Your brother would be really happy

00:21:42.562 --> 00:21:43.642
to hear all that.

00:21:45.402 --> 00:21:46.243
What's the point?

00:21:47.003 --> 00:21:49.203
People only regret things
after they grow up.

00:21:50.562 --> 00:21:51.642
But it's usually

00:21:52.642 --> 00:21:53.882
too late at that point.

00:22:02.283 --> 00:22:02.723
Yan Fei.

00:22:03.122 --> 00:22:04.243
You're doing great.

00:22:05.483 --> 00:22:06.562
Everything will be fine.

00:22:07.602 --> 00:22:08.523
We will help you

00:22:09.402 --> 00:22:11.122
figure everything out.

00:22:12.122 --> 00:22:12.523
Okay?

00:22:16.562 --> 00:22:17.043
Thank you.

00:22:20.122 --> 00:22:21.562
Could you turn around?

00:23:07.683 --> 00:23:08.802
Break time's over.

00:23:09.443 --> 00:23:10.602
I'm going back to Xingke.

00:23:11.602 --> 00:23:13.402
Today's my last day at Jun An.

00:23:18.683 --> 00:23:19.304
I got this.

00:23:52.203 --> 00:23:52.642
Yan Fei.

00:23:58.602 --> 00:23:59.842
We agreed not to say goodbye.

00:24:00.082 --> 00:24:00.802
I just want to

00:24:01.562 --> 00:24:02.402
tell you that

00:24:02.763 --> 00:24:04.162
I contacted some well-known

00:24:04.162 --> 00:24:05.723
IP lawyers and industry specialists.

00:24:05.882 --> 00:24:07.402
I also posted on industry forums.

00:24:08.162 --> 00:24:10.642
Also, I think you should focus
on stabilizing the company

00:24:10.642 --> 00:24:12.362
to create favorable conditions

00:24:12.362 --> 00:24:13.602
and buy time.

00:24:13.923 --> 00:24:15.523
So, take your executives

00:24:15.523 --> 00:24:16.963
to visit key investors.

00:24:17.402 --> 00:24:18.562
Have your staff reassure

00:24:18.683 --> 00:24:19.723
suppliers and clients.

00:24:20.043 --> 00:24:20.723
I've also

00:24:21.162 --> 00:24:23.082
compiled past case studies

00:24:23.322 --> 00:24:24.763
and strategies for PR

00:24:24.763 --> 00:24:25.763
in crisis handling.

00:24:25.802 --> 00:24:26.162
Can...

00:24:28.402 --> 00:24:29.283
Can I hug you?

00:24:53.642 --> 00:24:54.842
Whenever you need help,

00:24:56.723 --> 00:24:57.723
come to me.

00:25:01.003 --> 00:25:01.443
Thanks.

00:25:10.523 --> 00:25:11.043
I have to go.

00:25:50.692 --> 00:25:51.802
(Xingke, The Other Company)

00:25:51.802 --> 00:25:53.723
Local police searched Yan Da's office

00:25:53.723 --> 00:25:55.602
at Xingke's branch office

00:25:55.963 --> 00:25:57.763
and found a notebook on his desk,

00:25:57.842 --> 00:26:00.003
which contained
detailed transaction records

00:26:00.003 --> 00:26:01.162
and custom product specs

00:26:01.483 --> 00:26:03.443
of the competitor's clients.

00:26:03.923 --> 00:26:05.763
And Yan Da happened to be visiting

00:26:05.763 --> 00:26:06.763
one of the main clients

00:26:07.082 --> 00:26:08.683
from this exact

00:26:08.763 --> 00:26:09.602
client list.

00:26:10.763 --> 00:26:12.203
It was 15 days from his departure

00:26:12.203 --> 00:26:13.483
to detention.

00:26:13.723 --> 00:26:14.642
I asked Yan Fei for

00:26:14.642 --> 00:26:16.402
their internal surveillance footage.

00:26:16.723 --> 00:26:17.723
Other than him,

00:26:17.723 --> 00:26:19.162
only his assistant He Fan

00:26:19.162 --> 00:26:20.523
frequently visited his office.

00:26:21.043 --> 00:26:23.162
His ex Zhang Xiaomei
also visited several times,

00:26:23.322 --> 00:26:24.882
which matches her earlier statement.

00:26:25.162 --> 00:26:26.763
Have we reached Zhang Xiaomei?

00:26:27.602 --> 00:26:29.802
I've been monitoring her social media.

00:26:29.923 --> 00:26:31.602
She recently posted a vlog

00:26:31.882 --> 00:26:33.122
about her vacation trip.

00:26:33.402 --> 00:26:35.483
We can tell from
her replies to the comments

00:26:35.602 --> 00:26:36.802
that she's in low spirits

00:26:36.963 --> 00:26:38.602
and traveling with friends.

00:26:38.963 --> 00:26:40.723
I also checked with Yan Fei.

00:26:41.203 --> 00:26:43.003
Zhang Xiaomei had been ignoring

00:26:43.003 --> 00:26:44.162
the calls and messages

00:26:44.283 --> 00:26:45.203
from the Yan family.

00:26:45.523 --> 00:26:46.082
But Guo Xiaoyu

00:26:46.122 --> 00:26:48.642
has been reaching out
to Zhang Xiaomei online.

00:26:48.923 --> 00:26:50.243
If intel's reliable,

00:26:50.362 --> 00:26:52.122
Zhang Xiaomei will return next Monday.

00:26:52.322 --> 00:26:53.402
(Zhang Xiaomei)
We'll talk to her.

00:26:55.602 --> 00:26:56.723
I discussed with Xingke

00:26:56.723 --> 00:26:57.443
researchers.

00:26:57.683 --> 00:27:00.082
Invalidating the patent
is our strongest legal move.

00:27:00.642 --> 00:27:01.483
So, we need to

00:27:01.602 --> 00:27:03.802
prove that the technology existed

00:27:03.923 --> 00:27:05.003
before Airuiqi filed

00:27:05.003 --> 00:27:06.082
for a patent.

00:27:09.362 --> 00:27:09.683
Bill?

00:27:10.122 --> 00:27:10.763
This is Chuck.

00:27:11.243 --> 00:27:13.602
I got a little situation here.
Can you give me a hand?

00:27:14.203 --> 00:27:15.802
Mr. Liu, I'm Guo Xiaoyu.

00:27:15.802 --> 00:27:17.003
Do you remember me?

00:27:17.483 --> 00:27:19.802
I attended your lecture
on patent invalidation.

00:27:20.322 --> 00:27:20.802
Chris.

00:27:21.043 --> 00:27:22.642
Can you help me find a paper?

00:27:24.483 --> 00:27:24.802
Yes.

00:27:31.402 --> 00:27:32.683
Jiatong, check this link.

00:27:33.203 --> 00:27:35.483
Yan Fei's demeanor is completely

00:27:35.483 --> 00:27:36.683
different from before.

00:27:37.003 --> 00:27:38.443
(Yan Fei leading Xingke to the future)
She's a corporate tycoon now.

00:27:38.443 --> 00:27:40.283
(My brother and my father
were in charge)

00:27:40.283 --> 00:27:41.642
(of our family business.)

00:27:42.283 --> 00:27:44.842
(I rarely dealt with company matters.)

00:27:45.043 --> 00:27:45.882
She's amazing.

00:27:46.443 --> 00:27:48.043
(I shoulder great responsibility)

00:27:48.523 --> 00:27:50.362
(and want to make the company thrive.)

00:27:51.122 --> 00:27:53.203
Being a female business tycoon
isn't easy.

00:27:53.443 --> 00:27:55.003
She's having her own struggles.

00:28:04.968 --> 00:28:09.096
(Fei, you look like a tycoon. So cool.)

00:28:09.096 --> 00:28:11.592
(My husband told me about it.
You're amazing.)

00:28:11.592 --> 00:28:13.864
(Tell me if you need help.
I'll come back.)

00:28:13.864 --> 00:28:16.744
(I'm sure you'll handle it well.
Go for it.)

00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:19.984
(Thank you, guys. I'm doing fine.)

00:28:26.874 --> 00:28:28.872
(Ren Jiatong)

00:28:28.872 --> 00:28:30.728
(I tickled "Yan Fei")

00:28:38.056 --> 00:28:39.732
(We really miss you.)

00:28:39.732 --> 00:28:43.400
(And Mr. Zhou has been
working like crazy every day.)

00:28:50.882 --> 00:28:51.802
Are you nuts?

00:28:52.243 --> 00:28:52.723
Seriously!

00:29:06.683 --> 00:29:07.963
Welcome back. Let's talk.

00:29:11.122 --> 00:29:12.802
What is there to say?

00:29:13.082 --> 00:29:14.243
Didn't you say that

00:29:14.322 --> 00:29:15.243
hiding gets us nowhere?

00:29:15.483 --> 00:29:17.162
Why can't we clear things up?

00:29:17.602 --> 00:29:18.683
Get out. Let's talk.

00:29:21.082 --> 00:29:23.602
(Jiang Yutai)
This is Eddie mentioned by Zhang.

00:29:23.683 --> 00:29:25.243
He's a friend of the Yan family.

00:29:25.602 --> 00:29:27.283
According to Zhang Xiaomei,

00:29:27.443 --> 00:29:28.642
he recommended

00:29:28.642 --> 00:29:30.523
Yan Da's assistant He Fan.

00:29:30.723 --> 00:29:33.523
He also encouraged
Zhang Xiaomei's recent overseas trip,

00:29:33.523 --> 00:29:35.122
likely to divert

00:29:35.122 --> 00:29:36.483
our attention.

00:29:36.842 --> 00:29:39.283
But Zhang Xiaomei claims
she knew nothing about

00:29:39.402 --> 00:29:41.362
Jiang Chen and Yan Fei's photo

00:29:41.562 --> 00:29:43.362
on social media.

00:29:43.443 --> 00:29:44.402
It's even more fishy.

00:29:45.003 --> 00:29:46.362
He's their friend

00:29:46.562 --> 00:29:49.322
and the Asia-Pacific director
for a competitor.

00:29:49.802 --> 00:29:51.082
This guy seems complicated.

00:29:51.963 --> 00:29:53.483
Wait, his name sounds familiar.

00:29:54.602 --> 00:29:56.802
Didn't Yan Da set up a blind date

00:29:56.802 --> 00:29:58.483
for Yan Fei and this guy?

00:29:59.402 --> 00:30:00.043
It must be him.

00:30:00.322 --> 00:30:01.362
Yan Fei told me about him.

00:30:01.963 --> 00:30:03.162
Where is this Eddie?

00:30:03.802 --> 00:30:06.003
He's unreachable.
Yan Fei is working on it.

00:30:06.362 --> 00:30:07.483
Is He Fan back in China?

00:30:08.362 --> 00:30:08.763
Ms. Bai.

00:30:09.243 --> 00:30:10.322
Xingke Group picked her up

00:30:10.322 --> 00:30:11.562
after she returned.

00:30:11.842 --> 00:30:13.162
Should I arrange a meeting?

00:30:13.802 --> 00:30:15.602
Yes, please. As soon as possible.

00:30:15.763 --> 00:30:16.043
Okay.

00:30:16.923 --> 00:30:17.963
Good job, Ren Jiatong.

00:30:18.322 --> 00:30:18.842
Next group.

00:30:24.642 --> 00:30:27.483
Following Mr. Song's guidance,

00:30:27.483 --> 00:30:29.763
Xiaoyu and I propose

00:30:29.763 --> 00:30:31.003
to have Xingke

00:30:31.122 --> 00:30:32.523
file a patent invalidation claim.

00:30:32.923 --> 00:30:34.322
After extensive research,

00:30:34.322 --> 00:30:34.963
we've discovered

00:30:35.043 --> 00:30:36.122
that this patent has faced

00:30:36.122 --> 00:30:38.683
multiple invalidation lawsuits
abroad from several companies.

00:30:39.082 --> 00:30:41.963
This strongly suggests
the patent is flawed.

00:30:42.203 --> 00:30:43.443
We recommend Xingke

00:30:43.443 --> 00:30:45.322
work with a technical evaluation agency

00:30:45.483 --> 00:30:46.642
to examine the patent

00:30:46.683 --> 00:30:48.203
and explore invalidation strategies

00:30:48.203 --> 00:30:48.923
in depth.

00:30:48.963 --> 00:30:49.362
Yeah.

00:30:49.723 --> 00:30:51.283
Challenging their patent's validity

00:30:51.283 --> 00:30:52.683
will put pressure on them.

00:30:53.043 --> 00:30:54.642
Legal actions drive settlement

00:30:54.642 --> 00:30:55.763
in patent disputes.

00:30:55.923 --> 00:30:58.003
Both parties ultimately aim

00:30:58.003 --> 00:30:59.203
for cooperation.

00:30:59.602 --> 00:31:01.402
The recent high-profile

00:31:01.402 --> 00:31:03.723
patent invalidation cases
among major firms

00:31:03.882 --> 00:31:06.082
parallel our situation to some extent.

00:31:06.562 --> 00:31:07.240
Not bad, huh?

00:31:08.562 --> 00:31:10.122
Guo Xiaoyu, I heard

00:31:10.122 --> 00:31:11.162
you contacted

00:31:11.362 --> 00:31:12.402
some tech influencers

00:31:12.402 --> 00:31:13.963
and video bloggers

00:31:13.963 --> 00:31:14.963
to gather information.

00:31:15.483 --> 00:31:16.723
How did you get them to help?

00:31:17.562 --> 00:31:20.723
I'm not an expert in the chip industry,

00:31:20.842 --> 00:31:22.043
but I realized that

00:31:22.043 --> 00:31:23.162
I'm also a content creator.

00:31:23.483 --> 00:31:24.963
So I considered their perspective.

00:31:25.283 --> 00:31:27.243
Content is the key for influencers.

00:31:27.243 --> 00:31:29.082
They need something fresh and engaging

00:31:29.082 --> 00:31:30.203
for the viewers.

00:31:30.443 --> 00:31:32.402
So I contacted Yan Fei.

00:31:32.763 --> 00:31:33.483
She agreed

00:31:33.763 --> 00:31:34.602
to be interviewed

00:31:34.602 --> 00:31:36.043
by the main vloggers

00:31:36.043 --> 00:31:36.642
in exchange

00:31:36.763 --> 00:31:38.283
for their help.

00:31:39.162 --> 00:31:40.122
For Xingke,

00:31:40.443 --> 00:31:41.802
it's an effective PR event.

00:31:42.082 --> 00:31:42.683
It's a win-win.

00:31:43.283 --> 00:31:43.683
Well done.

00:31:44.683 --> 00:31:46.203
We only did

00:31:46.203 --> 00:31:47.243
supporting work.

00:31:47.683 --> 00:31:49.402
Credit goes to Mr. Zhou.

00:31:49.842 --> 00:31:51.683
He's been guiding us

00:31:51.882 --> 00:31:53.923
to contact IP experts

00:31:53.923 --> 00:31:55.322
and industry specialists.

00:31:55.602 --> 00:31:57.122
He taught us how to draft posts

00:31:57.402 --> 00:31:58.923
and pulled all-nighters with us.

00:31:59.882 --> 00:32:00.763
I did my job.

00:32:01.923 --> 00:32:02.728
You're too modest.

00:32:05.683 --> 00:32:06.003
Okay.

00:32:07.362 --> 00:32:07.963
One more thing.

00:32:09.882 --> 00:32:11.283
The Talent Hunt Program

00:32:11.283 --> 00:32:12.763
is concluding in a few weeks.

00:32:13.283 --> 00:32:15.763
From now on, your performance

00:32:16.003 --> 00:32:18.162
will be critical
for the final assessment.

00:32:19.283 --> 00:32:20.642
I'll compile the meeting notes

00:32:20.642 --> 00:32:22.402
and summarize your recent contributions,

00:32:22.483 --> 00:32:23.483
and then share them

00:32:24.362 --> 00:32:25.963
with your supervising lawyers.

00:32:31.082 --> 00:32:32.523
Now, back to work, everyone.

00:32:33.362 --> 00:32:34.362
For your friend

00:32:35.162 --> 00:32:36.122
and yourselves.

00:32:47.523 --> 00:32:48.322
Still awake?

00:32:49.402 --> 00:32:51.283
I'm studying He Fan's profile.

00:32:51.763 --> 00:32:52.443
You too?

00:32:56.923 --> 00:32:58.562
Jiatong, my friend

00:32:58.562 --> 00:32:59.642
is in trouble recently.

00:33:00.082 --> 00:33:01.802
She's a Hanfu culture enthusiast

00:33:02.162 --> 00:33:04.402
who noticed a designer brand

00:33:04.402 --> 00:33:06.162
copying traditional Hanfu designs

00:33:06.162 --> 00:33:06.842
and denying it.

00:33:07.283 --> 00:33:09.362
She made videos exposing this,

00:33:09.642 --> 00:33:11.082
and now they're suing her.

00:33:12.203 --> 00:33:15.802
She's taking college entrance exam soon,
too scared to tell her parents.

00:33:16.322 --> 00:33:17.683
So she reached out

00:33:17.763 --> 00:33:18.642
through our circle

00:33:18.923 --> 00:33:20.162
and contacted me.

00:33:20.483 --> 00:33:21.162
This hits

00:33:21.162 --> 00:33:22.483
a nerve for me as a Hanfu fan.

00:33:22.963 --> 00:33:23.923
I want to help her.

00:33:25.082 --> 00:33:25.723
Xiaoyu.

00:33:26.322 --> 00:33:28.523
The final assessment
was just announced today.

00:33:29.162 --> 00:33:30.243
Do you have time?

00:33:31.043 --> 00:33:33.043
I can't watch anyone bully young girls.

00:33:34.283 --> 00:33:35.402
I've made up my mind.

00:33:35.562 --> 00:33:36.882
I'll stay up late and make

00:33:36.882 --> 00:33:38.082
counter-argument videos

00:33:38.322 --> 00:33:39.802
after work every day.

00:33:40.483 --> 00:33:41.963
It shouldn't affect my work.

00:33:42.443 --> 00:33:43.122
Also,

00:33:43.562 --> 00:33:45.642
I contacted several
Hanfu community leaders.

00:33:45.882 --> 00:33:47.162
They're eager

00:33:47.203 --> 00:33:48.562
to help gather evidence.

00:33:49.642 --> 00:33:51.523
Their enthusiasm fires me up.

00:33:54.963 --> 00:33:57.162
Here's my compilation

00:33:57.523 --> 00:33:59.402
of relevant infringement cases,

00:34:00.162 --> 00:34:00.963
plus updates

00:34:00.963 --> 00:34:02.723
I consistently track.

00:34:02.802 --> 00:34:03.842
Hope this helps.

00:34:06.003 --> 00:34:06.602
Jiatong.

00:34:07.523 --> 00:34:09.523
A day is only 24 hours.

00:34:09.642 --> 00:34:11.242
How can you do so many things?

00:34:13.282 --> 00:34:14.242
Go for it, Xiaoyu.

00:34:14.883 --> 00:34:15.722
I believe in you.

00:34:16.162 --> 00:34:17.282
Call me if you need help.

00:34:18.403 --> 00:34:19.003
Jiatong.

00:34:20.043 --> 00:34:21.202
I'm so touched.

00:34:22.043 --> 00:34:24.483
I knew you cared.

00:34:25.122 --> 00:34:25.762
I swear

00:34:26.363 --> 00:34:27.762
I'll treasure this forever.

00:34:29.003 --> 00:34:30.323
Stop it, or I'm taking it back.

00:34:32.682 --> 00:34:34.682
No way. This is your love for me.

00:34:38.856 --> 00:34:40.264
(He Fan agreed to meet.)

00:34:40.264 --> 00:34:42.696
(Tomorrow at 9:00 AM.
Cafe near her place.)

00:34:42.696 --> 00:34:44.696
(I need an assistant. Who is free?)

00:34:46.088 --> 00:34:46.696
(Me.)

00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:48.632
(Me.)

00:34:49.672 --> 00:34:51.528
(Ms. Bai, let me tag along.)

00:35:11.048 --> 00:35:13.496
(Ms. Bai, I've done some research
on He Fan.)

00:35:13.496 --> 00:35:15.560
(I've sent it to you just now.
Please take a look.)

00:35:15.752 --> 00:35:18.072
(Got it. Ren Jiatong, it is.)

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:24.824
(Give me a break, okay?)

00:35:27.816 --> 00:35:28.910
(No way.)

00:35:51.369 --> 00:35:53.960
(Ms. Bai, I've sent you the files
on this meeting.)

00:35:54.888 --> 00:35:56.648
(I'll also bring the hard copy.)

00:35:57.192 --> 00:35:59.704
(Also, here is the closest parking lot.)

00:36:06.952 --> 00:36:09.800
(Can you talk?
Your mom is in the hospital.)

00:36:10.602 --> 00:36:12.682
I reviewed the materials
you sent last night.

00:36:12.682 --> 00:36:13.722
Well-organized.

00:36:14.003 --> 00:36:15.443
He Fan is the key for now.

00:36:17.803 --> 00:36:18.323
What's wrong?

00:36:19.642 --> 00:36:20.122
Nothing.

00:36:21.642 --> 00:36:23.003
If there is something urgent,

00:36:23.443 --> 00:36:25.642
request personal leave right now.

00:36:25.963 --> 00:36:27.162
If you're unwell,

00:36:27.162 --> 00:36:28.282
seek medical help.

00:36:28.363 --> 00:36:29.963
Otherwise, you'll hinder your work.

00:36:30.403 --> 00:36:32.242
Our profession tolerates zero errors.

00:36:32.523 --> 00:36:35.043
Without mental clarity
and sharp reflexes,

00:36:35.082 --> 00:36:36.122
you'll make mistakes

00:36:36.762 --> 00:36:38.043
that ruin our professionalism,

00:36:38.282 --> 00:36:39.082
and more crucially,

00:36:39.162 --> 00:36:40.523
harm our clients' interests.

00:36:43.003 --> 00:36:44.003
Stop wasting time.

00:36:44.323 --> 00:36:45.043
Speak your mind.

00:36:47.963 --> 00:36:48.682
It's not about me.

00:36:50.602 --> 00:36:52.403
My mom was in a car accident.

00:36:53.202 --> 00:36:53.963
Sorry, Ms. Bai.

00:36:53.963 --> 00:36:55.043
I'll get myself together.

00:36:55.043 --> 00:36:56.202
I should be professional.

00:36:56.403 --> 00:36:57.523
It's 9:00 AM now.

00:36:57.722 --> 00:36:59.803
Leave now
and you'll be home this afternoon.

00:37:01.043 --> 00:37:01.562
What?

00:37:02.162 --> 00:37:03.762
Should I take you to the train station?

00:37:04.323 --> 00:37:04.762
But...

00:37:04.762 --> 00:37:06.122
Learn from it.

00:37:06.562 --> 00:37:08.483
If anything similar happens again,

00:37:08.642 --> 00:37:10.043
report it to me immediately

00:37:10.722 --> 00:37:11.803
so that I have

00:37:11.803 --> 00:37:13.363
enough time to make arrangements.

00:37:14.323 --> 00:37:15.202
I'm sorry, Ms. Bai.

00:37:16.323 --> 00:37:17.363
I can go by myself.

00:37:17.363 --> 00:37:18.082
Don't worry.

00:37:18.082 --> 00:37:18.843
Go home.

00:37:19.202 --> 00:37:21.003
If you need help with anything,

00:37:21.003 --> 00:37:22.642
call me. Don't struggle alone.

00:37:23.162 --> 00:37:23.523
Remember.

00:37:23.963 --> 00:37:25.162
Jun An trains lawyers.

00:37:25.162 --> 00:37:25.883
Not machines.

00:37:27.043 --> 00:37:27.403
Go on.

00:37:28.642 --> 00:37:29.282
Thank you.

00:37:42.883 --> 00:37:43.242
Mom.

00:37:43.923 --> 00:37:44.443
You're awake.

00:37:46.282 --> 00:37:47.043
How do you feel?

00:37:48.722 --> 00:37:49.003
I'm...

00:37:49.883 --> 00:37:51.323
hurting everywhere.

00:37:52.602 --> 00:37:53.282
Be careful.

00:37:54.843 --> 00:37:55.682
But you're okay now.

00:37:55.803 --> 00:37:57.043
The surgery is done.

00:37:58.082 --> 00:38:00.202
Thankfully, you weren't going fast.

00:38:00.642 --> 00:38:02.003
Everything will be alright.

00:38:02.722 --> 00:38:04.602
But you can't get out of bed for now.

00:38:04.923 --> 00:38:06.483
Just rest and recover.

00:38:07.003 --> 00:38:08.003
We'll see what to do.

00:38:12.523 --> 00:38:13.843
Is that competition

00:38:15.282 --> 00:38:17.162
of yours almost over?

00:38:20.202 --> 00:38:22.082
Soon. Just a few more weeks.

00:38:22.803 --> 00:38:24.003
I'll finally make money

00:38:24.722 --> 00:38:25.682
if I can stay.

00:38:29.483 --> 00:38:30.483
All these years,

00:38:31.122 --> 00:38:32.803
you've been pushing yourself,

00:38:33.722 --> 00:38:35.722
giving your absolute all to everything.

00:38:36.403 --> 00:38:38.562
It breaks my heart to see you like this.

00:38:39.803 --> 00:38:40.403
And now,

00:38:41.642 --> 00:38:43.722
I've caused more trouble for you.

00:38:46.282 --> 00:38:47.043
You should go.

00:38:47.843 --> 00:38:48.562
Go back.

00:38:49.162 --> 00:38:49.642
I'm fine.

00:38:50.762 --> 00:38:51.963
Just rest well.

00:38:52.242 --> 00:38:53.762
I can hire a caregiver for you.

00:38:56.043 --> 00:38:57.403
Don't waste money.

00:38:58.082 --> 00:38:59.682
That's expensive.

00:39:01.562 --> 00:39:02.682
No, Mom. Don't worry.

00:39:13.803 --> 00:39:15.003
Is your job

00:39:15.682 --> 00:39:16.803
that demanding?

00:39:31.642 --> 00:39:33.043
Jiatong, you're back.

00:39:36.082 --> 00:39:37.082
How's your mom doing?

00:39:38.963 --> 00:39:39.923
Her surgery went well.

00:39:41.403 --> 00:39:42.162
But the doctor said

00:39:42.162 --> 00:39:43.803
she needs time to recover.

00:39:44.722 --> 00:39:46.363
He suggested I keep her company.

00:39:47.562 --> 00:39:48.443
Get some rest.

00:39:51.242 --> 00:39:52.323
Why are you still awake?

00:39:56.483 --> 00:39:57.883
I was waiting for you.

00:39:58.843 --> 00:40:00.202
You must be exhausted.

00:40:04.122 --> 00:40:05.963
You're an only child
from a wealthy family,

00:40:05.963 --> 00:40:07.562
and you came to Beijing for work.

00:40:07.963 --> 00:40:09.323
It's normal that your parents

00:40:09.323 --> 00:40:10.202
can't accept it.

00:40:11.003 --> 00:40:11.762
They'll

00:40:11.762 --> 00:40:13.242
come around to it eventually.

00:40:13.682 --> 00:40:14.280
Don't worry.

00:40:16.003 --> 00:40:16.883
My mom asked me

00:40:17.722 --> 00:40:20.082
why I had to come to Beijing
to practice law.

00:40:20.682 --> 00:40:22.323
The salary used to be competitive.

00:40:23.242 --> 00:40:25.483
But it's not so appealing anymore.

00:40:26.082 --> 00:40:27.363
I might as well go home

00:40:27.602 --> 00:40:29.242
and find a stable job there.

00:40:29.883 --> 00:40:31.323
You know what really upsets me?

00:40:31.762 --> 00:40:33.082
My parents recently told me

00:40:33.363 --> 00:40:34.602
that our relatives back home

00:40:34.843 --> 00:40:36.843
think being a lawyer is dishonorable.

00:40:37.363 --> 00:40:39.122
They think lawyers only defend criminals

00:40:39.363 --> 00:40:40.923
and take bribes from both sides.

00:40:41.282 --> 00:40:42.682
They think lawyers are scums.

00:40:43.843 --> 00:40:45.323
I was furious when I heard that.

00:40:45.323 --> 00:40:47.122
It's 2024, for goodness' sake.

00:40:47.762 --> 00:40:48.602
Why do I have to

00:40:48.602 --> 00:40:49.762
go home and try

00:40:49.762 --> 00:40:51.082
to change their stereotypes?

00:40:51.363 --> 00:40:52.642
And I can't reason with them.

00:40:55.202 --> 00:40:57.923
My mom also thinks
that lawyers are scums.

00:40:58.843 --> 00:41:00.883
But that's not how it is at all.

00:41:01.443 --> 00:41:02.923
Think about Ms. Bai, Mr. Song,

00:41:02.923 --> 00:41:03.843
Mr. Zhou, and Ms. Tian.

00:41:04.242 --> 00:41:06.282
They're all incredibly good people.

00:41:08.003 --> 00:41:09.202
Although I'm young,

00:41:09.722 --> 00:41:11.403
I'm a true digital native.

00:41:11.682 --> 00:41:12.843
I surf the web every day

00:41:13.323 --> 00:41:14.682
and I've seen a lot.

00:41:15.403 --> 00:41:17.803
I can tell people's characters.

00:41:18.282 --> 00:41:19.082
Gentle,

00:41:19.082 --> 00:41:19.762
kind-hearted,

00:41:19.762 --> 00:41:20.443
and passionate.

00:41:20.602 --> 00:41:21.602
They want to help

00:41:21.682 --> 00:41:23.242
when someone is in trouble.

00:41:24.003 --> 00:41:25.642
That's who they are.

00:41:28.642 --> 00:41:30.043
You'll be like them

00:41:30.762 --> 00:41:32.003
once you become a lawyer.

00:41:34.963 --> 00:41:37.242
Maybe that's your mission.

00:41:37.762 --> 00:41:39.282
You have to be a good lawyer.

00:41:39.843 --> 00:41:41.642
Meanwhile, you must
speak up for all of us

00:41:42.202 --> 00:41:43.963
and tell everyone about

00:41:44.282 --> 00:41:45.803
the challenges we face.

00:41:51.202 --> 00:41:52.242
We don't just work

00:41:52.242 --> 00:41:53.682
past midnight in CBD skyscrapers.

00:41:54.242 --> 00:41:56.162
We clock in at dawn
on the East 3rd Ring Road.

00:41:57.003 --> 00:41:58.122
We must always provide

00:41:58.443 --> 00:41:59.483
emotional support

00:41:59.483 --> 00:42:00.483
to our clients.

00:42:00.722 --> 00:42:02.202
We dare not miss a single call.

00:42:02.923 --> 00:42:04.883
Thankfully, Jun An gets enough clients.

00:42:05.883 --> 00:42:06.403
Otherwise,

00:42:07.923 --> 00:42:08.803
it'd be unbearable.

00:42:09.162 --> 00:42:10.082
So tell me,

00:42:10.883 --> 00:42:11.602
why do they

00:42:12.363 --> 00:42:14.043
keep going when it's so hard?

00:42:15.242 --> 00:42:17.523
Surely there are breaking points.

00:42:19.443 --> 00:42:21.523
I asked Ms. Bai why she became a lawyer.

00:42:23.562 --> 00:42:24.162
She said,

00:42:26.282 --> 00:42:27.162
"Because I love it."

00:42:28.883 --> 00:42:29.803
She craves that feeling

00:42:29.803 --> 00:42:32.202
even if she wins
just one out of ten cases.

00:42:35.803 --> 00:42:38.082
Ms. Bai is who I want to be someday.

00:42:39.722 --> 00:42:41.162
But I'll never make it.

00:42:42.483 --> 00:42:42.923
Jiatong,

00:42:43.323 --> 00:42:44.082
you got this.

00:42:44.648 --> 00:42:45.896
You're like a young Bai Xiao.

00:42:53.082 --> 00:42:53.602
Jiatong,

00:42:55.003 --> 00:42:55.403
look.

00:42:56.443 --> 00:42:58.403
He Fan accused Ms. Bai online,
saying that

00:42:58.403 --> 00:43:00.003
her coercive interrogation tactics

00:43:00.363 --> 00:43:02.323
made her collapse from stress.

00:43:03.483 --> 00:43:03.762
What?

00:43:04.122 --> 00:43:04.883
Outrageous.

00:43:04.883 --> 00:43:06.642
(He Fan's Post)
The netizens are cyberbullying Ms. Bai.

00:43:07.122 --> 00:43:07.963
What's going on?
