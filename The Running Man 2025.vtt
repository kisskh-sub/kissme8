21:21.628 --> 21:23.020
Wait, no, I need
to bring her this tonight.

21:23.194 --> 21:24.935
I promise, I will be back
before the show starts.

21:25.109 --> 21:26.415
No one comes back.

21:29.157 --> 21:31.159
Come on, man.
I have a sick kid.

21:31.333 --> 21:34.423
I’ll deliver it now

[frustrated roar]

01:13:08.819 --> 01:13:12.126

[Ben] <i>This is a message</i>

<i>If I die on this show,</i>
<i>I died for the two things</i> <i>I believe in.</i>

01:13:27.620 --> 01:13:29.927
<i>My wife and my kid.</i>

01:13:30.101 --> 01:13:33.974

01:15:05.501 --> 01:15:06.414

<i>...there was one.</i>
[cheering]

01:15:45.410 --> 01:15:48.456
<i>That’s right. Ben Richards</i>

01:15:48.631 --> 01:15:51.068

[man in distance]
Richards lives!

01:16:15.527 --> 01:16:17.311
Come on, hurry.

01:16:17.485 --> 01:16:19.313
Hunters will be out
for blood.

01:16:20.140 --> 01:16:21.968
They hate civilian kills.

01:16:22.142 --> 01:16:24.884
Things are gonna start
ramping up.

01:16:26.059 --> 01:16:27.321
Come on.

01:16:27.495 --> 01:16:28.801
I wouldn’t be surprised
if they fire up

01:16:28.975 --> 01:16:31.499
the DNA sniffers tonight.

01:16:31.674 --> 01:16:35.895
<i>I don’t want anything else. </i>
<i>I don’t need anyone else.</i>

01:16:36.069 --> 01:16:37.418
[mocking] What a tough guy.

01:16:37.593 --> 01:16:39.682
[Ben] <i>Is that clear?</i>
[woman sneering]

01:16:39.856 --> 01:16:42.206
<i>I’m not looking</i>
<i>for new friends.</i> <i>Don’t ask for an autograph.</i>

01:16:42.380 --> 01:16:45.557
Eltie!
What if he’s in Derry? He’s not in Derry, Mom.

01:16:45.731 --> 01:16:46.993
Don’t worry, it’s fine.

01:16:47.167 --> 01:16:48.560
She thinks you’re
an actual demon,

01:16:48.734 --> 01:16:49.779
but she’s fairly deaf.

01:16:49.953 --> 01:16:51.128
We can use
our normal voices.

01:16:51.302 --> 01:16:53.870
Kill him.
Welf bastard.

01:16:54.044 --> 01:16:56.002
Hunt him down!

01:16:56.176 --> 01:16:58.570
[Elton] She used to be
a kind, clever woman.

01:16:58.744 --> 01:17:01.051
[Elton]
This is where it all happens.

01:17:01.225 --> 01:17:05.185
Amateur lab for making
handcrafted soap, far as you know.

01:17:05.359 --> 01:17:06.709
[radio hissing]

01:17:06.883 --> 01:17:09.625
Some normal
non-revolutionary literature.

01:17:09.799 --> 01:17:11.409
Wink, wink.

01:17:11.583 --> 01:17:15.543
Copier for my harmless
community newsletter,

01:17:15.718 --> 01:17:17.676
if you follow my drift.
Uh-huh.

01:17:19.896 --> 01:17:21.506
So what’s a DNA sniffer?

01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:23.073
[sighs]

01:17:24.683 --> 01:17:28.861
Black ops scanners that I.D.
highly fragmented strands of DNA.

01:17:29.035 --> 01:17:30.907
These things are hidden
in every streetlamp across the country.

01:17:31.081 --> 01:17:33.170
Which is why you got to
get underground ASAP.

01:17:33.344 --> 01:17:35.476
[printer whirring]

01:17:35.651 --> 01:17:37.130
Man, if you want to ask,
just ask.

01:17:38.871 --> 01:17:41.091
What is up
with the hot dog cart?

01:17:42.483 --> 01:17:43.963
My dad was a cop.

01:17:46.313 --> 01:17:48.402
A good cop.

01:17:48.576 --> 01:17:51.057
He quit in protest
when the Network privatized local police.

01:17:52.232 --> 01:17:53.799
He believed officers
should be accountable

01:17:53.973 --> 01:17:56.236
to the towns that pay them,
not the government.

01:17:56.410 --> 01:17:57.977
And sure as hell
not some mega-corp.

01:17:58.891 --> 01:18:00.414
So he bought the cart.

01:18:00.588 --> 01:18:02.721
Busted his ass.
We never missed a meal.

01:18:02.895 --> 01:18:06.725
Better an honorable
hot dog vendor than a crooked Goon.

01:18:06.899 --> 01:18:10.903
But his friends
who signed on with the NCG didn’t appreciate his choices.

01:18:11.077 --> 01:18:13.036
And they let him know
every chance they got.

01:18:13.210 --> 01:18:16.082
He made damn sure
we were safe in this house.

01:18:16.256 --> 01:18:18.519
But every time
he took that cart out

01:18:18.694 --> 01:18:22.349
well... you see what
it did to my mom.

01:18:22.523 --> 01:18:24.743
And this is what they did
to my dad.

01:18:26.179 --> 01:18:28.529
His buddies on the force
never solved the case

01:18:28.704 --> 01:18:30.531
’cause they’re the ones
who killed him.

01:18:30.706 --> 01:18:32.620
But you can’t kill an idea.

01:18:32.795 --> 01:18:36.146
Dad was their worst nightmare.
A free man with a conscience.

01:18:37.538 --> 01:18:41.542
And everything they destroyed
in him lives on in me.

01:18:41.717 --> 01:18:47.157
Like a nuclear blast...
that never burns out.

01:18:47.331 --> 01:18:49.289
[canned drink opens, fizzes]

01:18:51.596 --> 01:18:52.597
Monster?

01:18:53.424 --> 01:18:55.252
I’m good.
[slurps]

01:18:56.253 --> 01:18:58.472
<i>Hey, Runners.</i>

01:18:58.646 --> 01:19:02.041
<i>You can’t outrun Fate.</i>
<i>And you cannot hide...</i>

01:19:02.694 --> 01:19:04.130
<i>from Destiny.</i>

01:19:04.304 --> 01:19:05.610
That’s actually not true.

01:19:09.875 --> 01:19:12.225
Before he was killed,
Dad refurbed this Cold War shelter

01:19:12.399 --> 01:19:13.792
he found in a nearby forest.

01:19:13.966 --> 01:19:16.012
I have a detailed map
for how to get there.

01:19:16.186 --> 01:19:17.709
You could survive down there
for three years.

01:19:17.883 --> 01:19:19.667
But you’ll only need it
for two weeks.

01:19:19.842 --> 01:19:22.148
We’ll pre-shoot the rest
of your tapes tomorrow.

01:19:22.801 --> 01:19:23.715
What do you think?

01:19:24.498 --> 01:19:25.325
Um...

01:19:25.499 --> 01:19:26.587
Or...

01:19:28.067 --> 01:19:30.287
Maybe just... white.

01:19:32.768 --> 01:19:34.204
Hardcore.

01:19:34.378 --> 01:19:35.379
Check this out.

01:19:36.859 --> 01:19:38.208
You can be arrested
just for having

01:19:38.382 --> 01:19:40.688
"The Truth" in your house.

01:19:40.863 --> 01:19:43.648
So these won’t be distributed
until right after you win.

01:19:43.822 --> 01:19:45.693
What the hell?

01:19:45.868 --> 01:19:48.392
It’s a special issue
on the Network’s most heinous crimes.

01:19:48.566 --> 01:19:50.002
What does that have
to do with me?

01:19:50.176 --> 01:19:52.352
A bomb’s chemicals
hold great power.

01:19:52.526 --> 01:19:56.095
But without an initiator
to make it go boom, it’s harmless.

01:19:56.269 --> 01:19:59.707
You know why they cheered
for you down there? They think you just might win.

01:19:59.882 --> 01:20:02.841
And if you can survive
against those Goons so can they.

01:20:03.015 --> 01:20:04.756
The people have had it.

01:20:04.930 --> 01:20:08.673
This country’s ready to blow...
and you’re the initiator.

01:20:08.847 --> 01:20:11.154
I’m not the initiator!

01:20:12.372 --> 01:20:14.548
I’m a guy trying
to get back to his family.

01:20:14.722 --> 01:20:17.377
It’s you against the world
either way, brother.

01:20:17.551 --> 01:20:19.031
Why not be both?

01:20:19.205 --> 01:20:21.555
[sighs]

01:20:21.729 --> 01:20:24.341
[maniacal laughter echoing]

01:20:25.995 --> 01:20:26.996
Come on.

01:20:32.262 --> 01:20:35.787
My mom thinks the bathroom
across the hall is haunted, so that’s all you.

01:20:35.961 --> 01:20:39.791
If the light in the hallway
is off, she’s asleep.

01:20:40.531 --> 01:20:42.141
Hey.

01:20:43.795 --> 01:20:44.840
I appreciate what you’re doing.

01:20:45.014 --> 01:20:46.754
But if they find out
you helped me,

01:20:46.929 --> 01:20:49.061
those same Goons
that got your dad...

01:20:50.193 --> 01:20:51.934
they’ll come for you.

01:20:52.108 --> 01:20:53.413
One can hope.

01:20:58.288 --> 01:20:59.637
[Ben]
<i>This message is for Cathy.</i>

01:21:03.771 --> 01:21:07.036
<i>I wanted to impart</i>
<i>a little dad advice.</i>

<i>Hit back.</i>

<i>Rule three:</i>

01:21:20.788 --> 01:21:24.792
<i>You can be kind and strong</i>
<i>at the same time.</i>

01:21:26.751 --> 01:21:30.711
<i>Rule four: Don’t trust</i>
<i>the Network... ever.</i>

01:21:32.061 --> 01:21:33.453
<i>And rule five:</i>

01:21:36.152 --> 01:21:38.023
<i>You remember...</i>

01:21:38.197 --> 01:21:40.330
<i>your dada loves you</i>
<i>a whole lot.</i>

01:21:42.201 --> 01:21:45.639
<i>I’ll be looking out for you. </i>
<i>No matter what.</i>

01:21:46.249 --> 01:21:47.467

BFE-20
is the most highly regulated industrial explosive.

01:42:00.853 --> 01:42:03.378
And you haven’t even set foot
in a state that sells it.

01:42:04.509 --> 01:42:06.424
I guess Molie didn’t
tell you everything.

01:42:06.598 --> 01:42:10.515
I got my finger stuck
in the detonator ring and it’s on half-cock.

01:42:10.689 --> 01:42:12.126
So...

01:42:12.300 --> 01:42:16.217
I want one of those big fancy
Flying-V airplanes.

01:42:16.391 --> 01:42:19.829
I want two autochutes
handed to Amelia at the bottom of the ramp.

01:42:20.003 --> 01:42:22.223
If the chutes are sabotaged,

01:42:22.397 --> 01:42:24.268
if you make
any sudden moves,

01:42:24.442 --> 01:42:25.878
if you don’t
back those trucks up

01:42:26.052 --> 01:42:28.925
and let me on that tarmac
right fucking now,

01:42:29.099 --> 01:42:31.754
you won’t even
hear it go boom.

01:42:31.928 --> 01:42:35.323
I’ll just see you in hell
and laugh in your face.

01:42:35.497 --> 01:42:36.628
You got one minute.

01:42:37.803 --> 01:42:38.848
[bullhorn feeds back, beeps]

01:42:39.022 --> 01:42:41.329
[breathes heavily]

01:42:41.503 --> 01:42:43.592
Shouldn’t take long.

01:42:43.766 --> 01:42:46.116
He’s got a direct line
to the boss.

01:42:48.162 --> 01:42:49.554
Last chance to run.

01:42:50.729 --> 01:42:52.775
No.

01:42:52.949 --> 01:42:55.865
You made me feel like
I’m the bad guy.

01:42:57.171 --> 01:42:58.911
Now I have to prove
I’m not.

01:43:00.130 --> 01:43:01.523
Why do you give a shit
what I think?

01:43:03.264 --> 01:43:05.135
You’re not the one
I’m trying to prove it to.

01:43:08.051 --> 01:43:09.444
So what’s our plan?

01:43:09.618 --> 01:43:11.228
<i>Let him through.</i>

01:43:11.402 --> 01:43:13.230
[Ben] <i>I’m gonna convince them </i>
<i>your handbag is a bomb</i>

01:43:13.404 --> 01:43:16.407
<i>long enough </i>
<i>to bail out over Canada.</i>

01:43:16.581 --> 01:43:21.586
<i>They’ll never let me win, so </i>
<i>I’m gonna slip out the back </i> <i>door and wait out the clock.</i>

01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:23.327
<i>We just have to keep</i>
<i>the audience entertained</i>

01:43:23.501 --> 01:43:26.417
<i>until that jet</i>
<i>crosses the border.</i>

01:43:26.591 --> 01:43:28.463
[Amelia]
What if they call your bluff?

01:43:28.637 --> 01:43:32.162
[Ben] You make sure
they know it’s real. Get scared, freak out.

01:43:32.336 --> 01:43:35.861
Curse, scream, call me
the worst names possible.

01:43:37.733 --> 01:43:39.735
Just remember, everything bad,

01:43:40.692 --> 01:43:42.346
it’s all good Free-Vee.

01:43:43.913 --> 01:43:46.263
<i>Act terrified when McCone</i>
<i>hands you the chutes.</i>

01:43:46.437 --> 01:43:48.483
[Amelia]
<i>I won’t have to act.</i>

01:43:48.657 --> 01:43:53.183
[Ben] <i>He grabs his gun,</i>
<i>you’ll know</i> <i>it’s time to go off.</i>

01:44:01.278 --> 01:44:03.672
So, you think you’re the guy

01:44:03.846 --> 01:44:06.022
who stops me
from seeing my daughter again?

01:44:06.196 --> 01:44:08.154
Show starts at 8:00.

01:44:08.329 --> 01:44:09.243
Get on the plane.

01:44:09.417 --> 01:44:11.636
Only if you take your mask off.

01:44:11.810 --> 01:44:12.898
Audience will love it.

01:44:13.072 --> 01:44:14.857
Keep dreaming.

01:44:15.031 --> 01:44:17.207
[Dan] <i>Do what he says.</i>
No copy.

01:44:17.381 --> 01:44:19.165
[Dan] <i>Do what he says. </i>
<i>Take it off.</i>

01:44:33.223 --> 01:44:35.312
There he is.

01:44:35.921 --> 01:44:37.532
[wolf whistles]

01:44:41.013 --> 01:44:43.538
Come on,
show starts at 8:00.

01:44:47.933 --> 01:44:50.545
[automated voice]
<i>Welcome aboard, Mr. Richards,</i>

01:44:50.719 --> 01:44:54.331
<i>to the Net-Air Flying-V</i>
<i>Luxury Jetliner,</i>

01:44:54.505 --> 01:44:56.681
<i>the ultimate</i>
<i>in private travel.</i>

01:44:56.855 --> 01:44:59.031
<i>With state-of-the-art</i>
<i>safety features,</i>

01:44:59.205 --> 01:45:03.079
<i>this is first-class comfort</i>
<i>taken sky high.</i>

01:45:03.253 --> 01:45:07.562
<i>So sit back and enjoy the most </i>
<i>relaxing flight of your life.</i>

01:45:07.736 --> 01:45:09.999
Oh, welcome aboard,
Mr. Richards.

01:45:10.173 --> 01:45:11.696
I’m Captain Holloway.

01:45:11.870 --> 01:45:14.525
You’ll excuse me
if I don’t shake your hand.

01:45:15.483 --> 01:45:17.006
That’s First Officer
Duninger

01:45:17.180 --> 01:45:19.617
and Navigation Officer Donahue
to your left.

01:45:20.662 --> 01:45:21.837
Looks like you’re missing one.

01:45:24.579 --> 01:45:27.408
Hey, Captain,
how many lavatories are on this rust bucket?

01:45:27.582 --> 01:45:29.888
Four.
Six.

01:45:30.062 --> 01:45:32.064
Why don’t you check them all
for stowaways?

01:45:32.238 --> 01:45:34.110
Anyone sneaks up on me,

01:45:34.284 --> 01:45:35.633
it’s gonna be
a real short ride.

01:45:35.807 --> 01:45:37.853
So, where
are we headed tonight?

01:45:39.376 --> 01:45:42.118
Plot a route
over the richest homes from here to Canada.

01:45:42.945 --> 01:45:45.034
Fly as low as you can.

01:45:45.208 --> 01:45:48.211
Let me know when we’re
ten minutes from the border. [Holloway] As you wish.

01:45:57.307 --> 01:45:58.743
[bell dings]

01:45:58.917 --> 01:46:01.180
<i>The seat belt sign is now off.</i>

01:46:01.355 --> 01:46:02.965
<i>Feel free</i>
<i>to move about the cabin.</i>

01:46:03.139 --> 01:46:06.229
Hey, Richards.
Six minutes to showtime.

01:46:06.403 --> 01:46:08.666
You should get that last meal
before they clear me to blow your head off

01:46:08.840 --> 01:46:10.407
in front of
a couple billion people.

01:46:10.581 --> 01:46:12.278
[Ben] Oh, yeah?

01:46:12.453 --> 01:46:14.585
You should really
put some makeup on before the show starts.

01:46:14.759 --> 01:46:16.848
Fuck the show! Let’s go.

01:46:17.022 --> 01:46:19.721
You want to go?
We can all go right now! No, no, no! Just stop!

01:46:19.895 --> 01:46:21.940
Do it! Do it, tough guy!

01:46:22.114 --> 01:46:23.725
Why are you doing this?
See if I twitch.

01:46:23.899 --> 01:46:25.379
Show him the bomb!

01:46:25.553 --> 01:46:27.772
Show it to him before
he shoots you and kills us all!

01:46:27.946 --> 01:46:30.471
Ma’am...
No, just show it!

01:46:30.645 --> 01:46:33.387
’Cause I don’t want to
feel like this anymore! Do you fucking hear me?

01:46:33.561 --> 01:46:34.518
I’m done!
Let’s calm down.

01:46:34.692 --> 01:46:35.867
Calm down.
I’m fucking done!

01:46:36.041 --> 01:46:37.129
All right, Richards,
what if I offer you

01:46:37.303 --> 01:46:39.088
an amnesty deal
and an exit visa?

01:46:39.262 --> 01:46:41.003
You’re nothing
but a Halloween costume.

01:46:41.177 --> 01:46:42.874
You can’t offer me shit!

01:46:43.048 --> 01:46:45.399
[Dan] <i>Too true, Mr. Richards. </i>
<i>He can’t.</i>

01:46:45.573 --> 01:46:48.097
<i>But I can.</i>
How about I offer you a deal?

01:46:48.271 --> 01:46:50.360
You tell your Hunters
in the cockpit

01:46:50.534 --> 01:46:52.449
to do what I tell them,
otherwise,

01:46:52.623 --> 01:46:55.409
I blow up this jet
and everyone on it!

01:46:55.583 --> 01:46:57.280
<i>Ben, I admire your commitment </i>
<i>to the bit,</i>

01:46:57.454 --> 01:46:59.587
<i>but we’re short on time, so...</i>

01:46:59.761 --> 01:47:01.153
<i>I’ll be blunt.</i>

01:47:01.327 --> 01:47:02.677
<i>We know you’re bluffing.</i>

01:47:04.287 --> 01:47:08.465
<i>The Flying-V Mark 2 has </i>
<i>scanners built into the doors.</i>

01:47:08.639 --> 01:47:10.902
<i>It’s been wildly entertaining.</i>

01:47:11.076 --> 01:47:14.776
<i>But you can give Amelia </i>
<i>her lovely handbag back now.</i>

01:47:14.950 --> 01:47:16.386
[McCone laughs]

01:47:18.170 --> 01:47:19.868
[sighs]

01:47:20.869 --> 01:47:22.305
[Dan] <i>Evan.</i>

01:47:23.524 --> 01:47:24.916
<i>Evan, don’t.</i>

01:47:25.090 --> 01:47:27.005
That’s game.
[guns clicking]

01:47:28.180 --> 01:47:29.268
Safety that weapon, sir.

01:47:29.443 --> 01:47:30.922
[Dan] <i>Evan, are you insane?</i>

01:47:31.096 --> 01:47:32.489
<i>The show hasn’t even started.</i>

01:47:32.663 --> 01:47:36.145
<i>Hand over your gun </i>
<i>and go to the back of the jet.</i>

01:47:39.148 --> 01:47:40.715
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:47:40.889 --> 01:47:43.065
<i>You can remain there</i>
<i>until I say otherwise.</i>

01:47:45.937 --> 01:47:48.113
<i>I need a moment to have</i>
<i>a word with Mr. Richards</i>

01:47:48.287 --> 01:47:49.941
<i>to discuss</i>
<i>a sensitive matter.</i>

01:47:50.115 --> 01:47:51.552
[electronic chiming]

01:47:51.726 --> 01:47:54.250
<i>Let’s keep this between us.</i>

01:47:57.035 --> 01:48:00.648
<i>You know,</i>
<i>it wasn’t too long ago</i> <i>that someone with my job</i>

01:48:00.822 --> 01:48:03.085
<i>thought it was more important </i>
<i>to force some</i>

01:48:03.259 --> 01:48:05.479
<i>hypocritical moral message</i>
<i>down society’s throat</i>

01:48:05.653 --> 01:48:08.960
<i>than to simply entertain them.</i>

01:48:09.134 --> 01:48:11.963
<i>They forgot about</i>
<i>the power of illusion,</i> <i>the power of the star,</i>

01:48:12.137 --> 01:48:14.488
<i>which is what you are,</i>
<i>Richards.</i>

01:48:14.662 --> 01:48:17.142
<i>And this is why we want</i>
<i>to offer you your own show.</i>

01:48:17.316 --> 01:48:18.883
<i>Now picture it.</i>

01:48:19.057 --> 01:48:21.756
<i>A former Runner redeemed </i>
<i>through righteous vengeance,</i>

01:48:21.930 --> 01:48:23.148
<i>turns his life around</i>

01:48:23.322 --> 01:48:26.761
<i>to become</i>
<i>a lethal force for good.</i>

01:48:26.935 --> 01:48:28.719
<i>They call him...</i>

01:48:28.893 --> 01:48:30.852
The Hunter.

01:48:31.026 --> 01:48:35.073
<i>The board has authorized me </i>
<i>to pay you 5 million </i> <i>new dollars per season.</i>

01:48:35.247 --> 01:48:36.510
<i>There’s only one condition.</i>

01:48:36.684 --> 01:48:39.425
<i>Sit back, watch the intro</i>

01:48:39.600 --> 01:48:43.125
<i>and when Bobby cues you, </i>
<i>kill every Hunter on that jet.</i>

01:48:43.299 --> 01:48:46.650
<i>Condition met,</i>
<i>I’ll remote-pilot you</i> <i>back to the studio jetport,</i>

01:48:46.824 --> 01:48:48.565
<i>where the president</i>
<i>of the United States</i>

01:48:48.739 --> 01:48:50.959
<i>will induct you</i>
<i>as "Hunter Number Six,"</i>

01:48:51.133 --> 01:48:53.657
<i>another title idea</i>
<i>I’m playing with.</i>

01:48:53.831 --> 01:48:55.354
<i>The data says</i>
<i>the revenge plot--</i>

01:48:55.529 --> 01:48:56.530
[Ben] Revenge?

01:48:56.704 --> 01:48:58.662
Revenge for what?

01:48:58.836 --> 01:49:02.100
Who is gonna root for a guy
who kills your national heroes?

01:49:02.274 --> 01:49:03.667
I call bullshit, Dan.

01:49:03.841 --> 01:49:05.800
<i>Let me worry</i>
<i>about the creative.</i>

01:49:05.974 --> 01:49:07.541
No deal.

01:49:07.715 --> 01:49:09.281
<i>The truth, then.</i>

01:49:11.980 --> 01:49:14.504
<i>Revenge</i>
<i>for your wife and child.</i>

01:49:17.551 --> 01:49:18.943
Why would I ever believe you?

01:49:19.117 --> 01:49:21.946
<i>Because,</i>
<i>if they were still alive,</i>

01:49:22.120 --> 01:49:25.559
<i>I’d hold them at gunpoint</i>
<i>and force you to do</i> <i>whatever I want.</i>

01:49:25.733 --> 01:49:28.692
<i>And torture them</i>
<i>right in front of you.</i>

01:49:28.866 --> 01:49:30.651
<i>I didn’t want to show you this.</i>

01:49:30.825 --> 01:49:32.609
<i>But I’m out of time</i>
<i>to save your life.</i>

01:49:34.089 --> 01:49:36.918
<i>The Hunter you killed</i>
<i>was part of a tight crew.</i>

01:49:37.092 --> 01:49:38.746
<i>McCone and the men</i>
<i>in that cockpit</i>

01:49:38.920 --> 01:49:41.139
<i>flew to Co-Op City</i>

01:49:41.313 --> 01:49:43.794
<i>to Sheila and Cathy’s</i>
<i>secret Uptown location.</i>

01:49:43.968 --> 01:49:45.274
No.
<i>They badged their way</i>

01:49:45.448 --> 01:49:47.493
<i>past the Family Alliance</i>
<i>agents and...</i>

01:49:48.451 --> 01:49:50.192
<i>I’m sorry, Ben.</i>

01:49:50.366 --> 01:49:52.020
<i>Not all accidents are happy.</i>

01:49:52.586 --> 01:49:54.413
No.

01:49:55.589 --> 01:49:58.940
[muffled screaming]

01:50:01.812 --> 01:50:03.814
[Dan] <i>We want you to win.</i>

01:50:03.988 --> 01:50:06.643
<i>The audience</i>
<i>is already on your side.</i>

01:50:06.817 --> 01:50:10.125
<i>Once I show them footage</i>
<i>of McCone and his men</i> <i>killing your family,</i>

01:50:10.299 --> 01:50:12.649
<i>they will follow you</i>
<i>into hell.</i>

01:50:12.823 --> 01:50:16.131
<i>Think of what this does</i>
<i>for your narrative.</i>

01:50:16.305 --> 01:50:19.482
<i>Thirty seconds</i>
<i>to showtime, Ben.</i>

01:50:19.656 --> 01:50:22.050
<i>You’ll find a gun</i>
<i>by the coffee station</i> <i>in the galley.</i>

01:50:22.224 --> 01:50:24.530
<i>But if you don’t sign </i>
<i>before the theme music ends,</i>

01:50:24.705 --> 01:50:28.491
<i>I’ll order the bastards</i>
<i>that killed your family</i> <i>to kill you, too.</i>

01:50:30.232 --> 01:50:32.887
[sound muffled]

01:50:33.061 --> 01:50:35.019
[no audio]

01:50:37.761 --> 01:50:39.328
What’s happening?

01:50:40.634 --> 01:50:43.462
[stammering] What’s happening?

01:50:45.247 --> 01:50:47.205
Tune in and find out.

01:50:48.076 --> 01:50:49.991
[breathing shakily]

01:50:52.167 --> 01:50:54.169
[device chimes]

01:50:57.346 --> 01:50:59.043
<i>Everyone, everyone,</i>
<i>please settle.</i>

01:50:59.217 --> 01:51:00.958
<i>Now, now.</i>

01:51:01.132 --> 01:51:02.307
Running <i>fans!</i>

01:51:03.569 --> 01:51:06.616
<i>We start today’s episode </i>
<i>with a heavy heart.</i>

01:51:06.790 --> 01:51:10.228
<i>We here at</i>The Running Man
<i>believe in following the rules.</i>

01:51:10.402 --> 01:51:11.795

01:51:18.497 --> 01:51:21.196
<i>Chief McCone and his Hunters.</i>

01:51:21.979 --> 01:51:23.328
<i>And that rule is</i>

01:51:23.502 --> 01:51:27.115
<i>we protect </i>

01:51:29.378 --> 01:51:31.554
<i>No one would play if we didn’t.</i>

01:51:33.034 --> 01:51:35.166
<i>We thought it only fair</i>
<i>to let Richards</i>

01:51:35.340 --> 01:51:39.214
<i>administer the penalty</i>
<i>for this grave infraction.</i>

01:51:39.388 --> 01:51:42.739

Chump.

You think you’re
the only Runner ever got offered a deal?

A. I killed your family.

Or C.
You’re too fucking stupid to figure it out?

Take it from someone
who took the deal

to be a Hunter
instead of the hunted.

01:55:31.054 --> 01:55:33.622
The only time you’ll ever see
your family again

01:55:33.796 --> 01:55:36.233
is when they torture them
in front of you.

01:55:37.278 --> 01:55:38.496
Fuck with your head enough

01:55:38.670 --> 01:55:40.716

kill it all away.

01:55:40.890 --> 01:55:42.500

But if it doesn’t,
just let her rip.

01:57:20.120 --> 01:57:22.339
When you get on the ground,
just run like hell.

I’m sorry they did this to you!

<i>And welcome</i>

01:58:56.477 --> 01:58:58.174
I already got a family.

Nothing I’ve done on the show makes me a hero.

01:59:24.592 --> 01:59:26.159
I tried to be a hero once,

And this is the only job
I could get.

01:59:41.174 --> 01:59:43.393
Seems like the whole point
of Free-Vee

01:59:44.699 --> 01:59:46.483
is to make us hate each other

01:59:48.137 --> 01:59:50.226
so they can keep
stealing from us

01:59:51.793 --> 01:59:54.622

<i>You think it was worth it?</i>

02:01:06.694 --> 02:01:08.391
That was fast.

<i>Work with me, Richards.</i>
<i>Don’t throw your life away.</i>

<i>Don’t make me fly that jet </i>
