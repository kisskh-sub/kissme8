WEBVTT

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:07.950
Wait here for a second.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:25.030
This is all your fault!

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.270
You should never have shown up.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.070
You should have stayed away from my Se Ri!

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.900
Fine. Go on, try me.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.270
You think the truth will disappear
just because I'm gone?

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.180
Just like Se Ri is my daughter,
Mi So is yours.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.280
And you're the one
who caused that tragedy...

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.380
to happen to your own daughter.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.760
Let me see your face. Are you hurt?

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.930
I'm fine.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.400
What in the world is going on?

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.330
Stay right here.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:11.610
Roll down your window.

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.180
What do you think you're doing?
Were you trying to run someone over?

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.080
Are you out of your mind?

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.520
Just you wait. I swear I'll get you...

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.820
out of my sight for good.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.790
Hey, Min Kyung Chae! Stop!

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.240
There are security cameras here, right?

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.880
Let's give the footage to the police
and report her for attempted murder.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.050
Min Kyung Chae looked completely unhinged.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.420
If we just let her go,
there's no telling what she'll do.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.960
She'll definitely think
this is all my fault.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.690
That if I weren't around,
things would be fine with Se Ri and Mi So.

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.160
They never change, do they?

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.330
Why is everyone in the Min family
like that?

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.030
Seriously, do any of them
have any self-awareness?

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.510
(Episode 121)

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.590
Ma'am, are you awake?

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.670
- Where am I?
- You're in the hospital.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.840
You were brought in after a fire.
Don't you remember?

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.040
A fire?

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.240
Yes.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:52.880
Se Ri!

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:54.880
Se Ri.

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.290
Are you okay? Stay with me!

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:01.450
Mom...

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:02.450
Just hang on.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.090
You have to stay conscious. Okay?

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:10.530
I remember now.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.030
My mom saved me.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.470
Where's my mom?

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.410
Please get my mom.

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:23.610
Mom.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:26.710
Mom.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.900
- Hello?
- Are you Min Se Ri's guardian?

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:51.970
I am. What is it?

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.640
The patient just woke up.
She's asking for you.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:57.880
She did?

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.910
Okay. I'm on my way.

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:10.190
Let's get you to Madam Jang's hotel.
I'd worry about you anywhere else.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.220
Take me somewhere else instead.

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.230
To see my Se Ri.

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.160
You want to see Se Ri?

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.530
I've barely gotten to see her.

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:22.900
Min Kyung Chae has been blocking
my visits.

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:35.050
Are you okay?

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:37.550
You're really awake, right?

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:46.190
I'm so relieved.

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.830
I thought I'd lost you.

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.130
I was so scared you'd never wake up.
I was a nervous wreck.

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:58.600
Let me look at you.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.570
How do you feel?

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:02.440
Are you hurt anywhere?

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.940
Tell me if you're in any pain.

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:07.410
I'm fine, Kyung Chae.

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.720
But where's Mom?

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.230
"Mom"? What are you talking about?

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.530
You aren't waiting for that woman,
are you?

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.700
Don't you remember what she did
when she left us?

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:34.240
She stole Dad's stake, wrecked
our whole household, and just left.

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:36.140
You know that.

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:38.610
And do you know
what she's like at the company?

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.280
She's strutting around
like she owns Mingang now.

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.750
She's already dead set
on kicking me out first.

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:48.990
After she gets rid of me,
Ji Seop and Soo Jung will be next.

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:52.060
That's why she went after the old chairman
in the first place.

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:53.890
Kyung Chae, what's gotten into you?

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:55.990
Why are you saying such awful things
about Mom?

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:59.300
I'm not badmouthing her.
I'm telling you the facts.

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:00.730
Look.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.500
I've held my tongue until now,
but that woman is a con artist.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.310
She lies every time she opens her mouth,

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:10.610
and she's a master at manipulating
situations to her advantage.

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.650
She's terrifying and will do anything
to get what she wants.

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.150
You have no idea how many incidents
she caused at the company, do you?

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:21.520
And was it any better at home?

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:24.760
We never had a moment's peace
after she moved in.

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.430
Mom's not like that!
She's always been so good to me!

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:30.330
You've got her all wrong.

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.860
She is not a good person.

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.200
Even if she acted like a mother to you,

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.070
she didn't mean any of it.

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.970
She was just using you
and playing with your feelings.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.280
I want to go home.

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:47.280
- I don't want to be here anymore.
- Wait.

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:48.910
Fine, I get it.

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:50.820
Go get changed and wait.

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.220
I'll go handle the discharge paperwork.

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:06.830
Why did she badmouth Mom...

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.370
when she barely even knows her?

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:17.040
Se Ri!

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:18.840
Mom.

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:25.250
When did you wake up?

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:27.050
Thank goodness.

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:30.690
Thank you so much for waking up.

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:35.060
Thank you so much for letting me
hold you like this again.

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:37.930
You were really worried about me,
weren't you, Mom?

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:54.780
What do you think you're doing here?

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:59.920
I thought I made it perfectly clear
you're not to come here.

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:04.020
- What are you doing?
- Go wait in the car.

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:05.360
Kyung Chae!

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.420
Now!

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:07.730
Do as I say.

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:11.760
Do you want to see me
drop dead right here?

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.100
Do I have to kill myself in front of you
to get you to listen to me?

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:17.370
Is that it?

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.400
Should I just die for you then?

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:20.910
Kyung Chae.

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:22.440
Just go now!

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:34.020
How dare you threaten her
by saying you'll kill yourself?

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:37.260
Is that any way
to treat your own daughter?

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:43.530
My patience has its limits.

00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:45.860
You tried to hit me with your car earlier,

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:47.160
and now you're trying to hit me?

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:52.040
I told you none of this
is going to change the truth.

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.340
Se Ri is mine.

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:57.510
She's my daughter!
I'm the one who gave birth to her.

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:01.380
Really?

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:05.320
So, we have one child and two mothers?

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:07.020
What should we do?

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:10.620
Should we cut her in half to share?

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:12.020
Fine. Be my guest.

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:14.560
Go right ahead.

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:16.860
Should I split her and take my half?

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:23.600
If I can't have her, neither can you.

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:40.890
Ms. Se Ri, what happened?
We were worried sick.

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:43.790
I think you took ten years off my life.

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:45.290
Are you all right, Se Ri?

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:47.360
Do you recognize me?

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:49.990
- How many fingers am I holding up?
- Who are you?

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:51.100
It's five.

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:52.830
Oh my...

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:55.930
Something must have happened
to her head...

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:58.840
after being kidnapped and then
getting caught in that fire.

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.110
She was just messing with you.

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:06.480
You've been through so much.
It must have been so hard on you.

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:08.480
If that woman happens
to show up at the house,

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:10.410
never let her in.

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:13.250
- "That woman"?
- Lucia.

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:15.750
Do not open the door for her,
no matter what.

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:18.290
Why would she even come here?

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:20.320
She might come here
and try to take Se Ri from me.

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:25.460
She's completely lost it.
So, whatever you do, don't open the door.

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:26.830
Okay.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.210
What's wrong with her?

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:37.070
Looks to me like she's the one
who's lost it.

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:38.540
Unbelievable.

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:45.250
Get changed first.

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:48.250
Why did you do that back at the hospital?

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:52.260
She came because she was worried.
How could you kick her out like that?

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:53.990
Have you not been listening
to a word I've said?

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:56.530
I told you she's a bad person!

00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:58.100
Seriously, what's wrong with you?

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:01.600
- I said I want to see my mom.
- And I told you no!

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:05.370
I'm confiscating this.

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:08.570
If I find out you contacted her
behind my back or went to see her,

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:10.410
it's over for both of us.

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:14.150
Promise me that you won’t see her.

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:16.610
You're not going to answer me?

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:28.960
What do you think you're doing?

00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:31.900
- What are you doing?
- Let go!

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.100
- Stop it!
- This is the only way...

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:35.770
to make sure you have no clothes
to go out in.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:41.540
What are you doing? Stop it!

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:48.610
Stop it!

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.720
What are you doing?

00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:58.990
I said stop!

00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:05.260
I heard Se Ri woke up.

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:07.500
That's a relief.

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:09.500
It's that woman I'm worried about.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.540
She keeps trying
to get her claws into Se Ri.

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:15.010
I should've finished her off
when I had the chance.

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:18.280
Why not just send Se Ri far away from her?

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:20.080
Why are you agonizing
over something so simple?

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:21.610
Far away? Where?

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:23.250
Should I send her abroad...

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:27.750
Of course.

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:30.690
I'll just send her abroad again.

00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:33.490
I'll send her somewhere
that woman can never find her.

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:36.260
Why didn't I think of that?

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:46.170
So she knows the girls
were switched at birth.

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:48.270
She's still doting
on another woman's child?

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:52.510
Even though she knows how tragically
her own child died,

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:54.850
she's determined to deny reality?

00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:57.580
Like that's going to work.

00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:00.420
The moment reality truly sinks in,

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:02.690
she'll completely lose her mind.

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:10.630
I wish I'd never woken up.

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.230
How can you say that?

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:15.630
If you hadn't, Ms. Kyung Chae
would have worried herself to death.

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:19.240
She was an absolute wreck,
worrying that you wouldn't wake up.

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:23.610
Then why is she doing this to me?
What is all this?

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:27.950
She's so over the top sometimes.
She's not even my mom.

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:33.120
Se Ri.

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:36.090
I need you to listen carefully
to what I'm about to say.

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:40.930
It might be a bit of a shock,
but you need to know the truth.

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:43.090
What are you planning on telling her?

00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:47.430
Kyung Chae is so obsessed with you...

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:49.730
- because...
- Ms. Ja Kyung. Please, don't.

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:53.040
It's because
you're Kyung Chae's secret daughter.

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:55.770
Your birth mother is Kyung Chae.

00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:59.010
Are you insane? What are you saying?

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:04.250
Kyung Chae is my mother?

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:06.620
Is that true?

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:10.050
No, it's not true!
Don't believe a word she's saying.

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:11.920
I'm asking you if it's true!

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:15.860
Is she really my mother?

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:18.030
Did she really give birth to me?

00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:20.030
It's true.

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:22.730
I'm sure she has her reasons,

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:26.000
but she secretly gave birth to you...

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.370
and registered you
as your father's daughter,

00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:29.740
so she could pretend to be your sister
all this time.

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:33.710
No way...

00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:35.980
How could she?

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:40.320
Then she should have told me.

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:41.720
Why did she keep it a secret
all this time?

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:45.790
I need to hear it from her myself.

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:47.930
I need to hear her say
whether she's my mother.

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:49.530
Se Ri.

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:52.460
Se Ri!

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:00.600
Se Ri.

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:04.910
What's wrong? Hey, why are you crying?

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:06.280
What are you doing here?

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:08.080
Mom.

00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:11.650
They're saying that Kyung Chae
is my mom...

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:14.750
and that she's been hiding it from me
this whole time.

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:19.460
Se Ri.

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:21.230
Calm down.

00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:25.430
This isn't the place.
Let's go somewhere quiet, okay?

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:47.080
What's going on with you two?

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:50.990
Madam Jang.

00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:53.090
Could you please look after Se Ri for me?

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:55.590
Look after her?
What are you talking about?

00:15:57.130 --> 00:15:58.130
Oh, dear.

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:01.930
You should wash up first.
Your face is a mess.

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:04.940
Go on, wash up in the bathroom over there.

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:12.840
What happened?

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:15.680
What were you thinking, bringing her here?

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:20.120
She found out that Min Kyung Chae
is her birth mother...

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:23.090
and it looks like she ran out in shock.

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:24.920
But she's not even her birth mother.

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:27.360
It seems she doesn't know that part yet.

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:30.790
I was already planning
to get Se Ri out of that house,

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:32.230
but things just ended up this way.

00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:34.260
Please look after her just for a few days.

00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:37.870
What a tangled mess.

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:41.840
That poor girl is just caught
between two mothers.

00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:45.810
What did you say? Se Ri ran away?

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:47.280
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:50.180
What on earth were you doing?
You couldn't even keep an eye on her?

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:53.920
Did Ja Kyung really say that to her?

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:58.760
I always knew her big mouth
would cause trouble one day,

00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:00.760
but I never imagined
it would be like this.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:07.460
What did Kyung Chae say?

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:10.430
Is she mad at me?

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:11.740
What do you think?

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:14.610
As if she hasn't been through enough.

00:17:14.610 --> 00:17:16.340
She just got home and is recovering,

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:17.880
and you poured gasoline on the fire?

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:20.840
Were you even thinking?

00:17:21.850 --> 00:17:24.010
I had no idea you could be so clueless.

00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:28.920
I just figured
Se Ri had to find out someday,

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:31.320
and it just slipped out before I knew it.

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:34.220
Anyway, this mouth of mine is the problem.
It really is.

00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:38.660
(Mingang Distribution)

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:40.300
What's wrong?

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.330
You seem anxious.

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:44.130
Se Ri...

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:47.400
found out I'm her birth mother
and ran away.

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:50.110
She left her phone,
so I can't even reach her.

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:52.640
I can't even look for her
if I don't know where she is.

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:54.610
She's probably with that woman.

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:59.420
- No way.
- I just saw them in the lobby, hugging,

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:01.190
and then they left the building together.

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:03.490
I knew it.

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:06.660
I knew she'd try
to take Se Ri from me one day.

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:08.630
I can't believe her!

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:13.060
Where on earth could they have gone?

00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:14.730
Isn't it obvious?

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:18.170
The one place she'd consider safest.

00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:20.470
A place you know very well, too.

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:28.450
Where's my Se Ri?

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:30.710
Where did you hide my daughter?

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:32.580
Give her back to me now.

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:34.520
- I said, give her back to me right now!
- Hey!

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:36.190
Hey, Min Kyung Chae!

00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:37.860
What do you think you're doing,
barging in here?

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:39.060
Have some class!

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:41.290
If you have something to say, be civil.

00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:43.690
Do you think I don’t know
that woman took Se Ri...

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:45.730
and is keeping her here?

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:47.360
Come out here right now!

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:51.200
I said, come out now
before I call the police!

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:53.270
Give me back my daughter, you kidnapper!

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:55.340
I said, give me back my daughter!

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:01.280
Se Ri.

00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:04.620
I'm not going with you.

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:07.150
Se Ri.

00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:10.490
If you're really my mom,
how could you do this to me?

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:14.090
You sent me away to study abroad at seven,
shuffling me from place to place.

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:16.630
You have no idea how lonely I was.

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:18.930
It was all for you.

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:21.400
Do you have any idea
how much that tuition cost?

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:24.030
People are dying to get into that school.

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:25.440
And that's not all.

00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:29.340
You said you hated the dorms,
so I got you a new luxury apartment...

00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:32.610
and had a housekeeper and private driver
treat you like a queen.

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:34.380
That's not what I wanted.

00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:36.510
I needed a mom.

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:40.080
A mom who was like a friend
who'd make eye contact with me, hug me...

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.420
and just talk to me.

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:44.150
Okay, from now on, I'll...

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:45.190
No.

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:46.790
Your mom will.

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:50.930
From now on, I'll be the mom
you want me to be.

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:52.930
It's too late.

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:54.970
Se Ri.

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:57.470
Why didn't you save me from that fire?

00:19:58.170 --> 00:19:59.370
Why didn't you run into the fire?

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:01.710
If you were really my mom,

00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:04.170
how could you hesitate
to save me from that fire?

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:07.810
Of course, you'd be scared.
You're only human.

00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:10.850
But a mother shouldn't be like that
when it's her child's life on the line.

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:14.720
Se Ri, you've got it all wrong.

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:16.350
I'm the one who saved you.

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:18.760
I carried you out
and took you to the hospital.

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:20.420
So what are you talking about?

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:23.960
You must not remember
because you were unconscious.

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:27.530
I saved you.

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:33.500
Stop lying! How can you lie to my face
about something like that?

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:37.070
When I collapsed in the fire,
the one who saved me wasn't you,

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:39.710
it was my mom.

00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:45.180
- Se Ri.
- I'd rather you just stay my sister.

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:47.080
That's just how I feel.

00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:50.590
It's hard for me to accept you as my mom.

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:54.990
I'm going to stay here with my mom
for a while.

00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:56.030
You should go.

00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:57.930
Se Ri.

00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:59.030
Se Ri!

00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:03.870
I think it's best you go now.

00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:06.270
Se Ri has clearly made up her mind.

00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:09.410
What did you do to turn her against me?

00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:12.280
How on earth did you manipulate her?

00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:14.680
She's my daughter.
I raised her for 20 years.

00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:16.980
How could you take her from me?

00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:19.020
Who do you think you are?

00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:26.860
Who do you think you are?

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:30.490
What do you think you're doing?
Stop harassing my mom!

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:57.150
What on earth happened to her?

00:21:57.950 --> 00:22:01.390
Hey, you don't think
she's really losing it, do you?

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:04.560
I know. She looks completely zoned out.

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:08.930
Ja Kyung said Se Ri ran away
and Kyung Chae went to bring her back.

00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:13.370
What is wrong with Se Ri?
Is now really the time to be running away?

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:15.010
Can you blame her?

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:18.080
The woman she thought was her sister
suddenly turns out to be her mom.

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:21.650
I get that,
but we have a million other problems now.

00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:26.220
And what about the company?
We're lucky Lucia is lying low for now,

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:28.520
but what if she exercises
Father's stake immediately?

00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:32.090
Kyung Chae needs to pull herself together,
so we can figure this out.

00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:34.690
She should've just left Se Ri alone
when she just got out of the hospital.

00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:37.530
Why did she have to
reveal her birth secret now?

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:39.960
Hey, where did your Ja Kyung go?

00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:43.200
Where did she go
after causing all this trouble?

00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:45.540
So you're saying you ran away
and came here?

00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:46.770
What did Ji Seop say?

00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:49.940
He freaked out about the mess I made.

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:53.280
There's no way I could listen
to all that nagging!

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:55.610
I'm just going to stay here for the night.

00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:57.650
You can stay the night if you want,

00:22:58.050 --> 00:23:00.050
but who on earth do you take after?

00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:01.790
If you were just 10 percent
like your father...

00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:04.120
But no, you had to be 99 percent
like your mother.

00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:06.660
So you always run that mouth of yours
and cause trouble.

00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:09.960
What kind of nonsense
is that supposed to be?

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:14.000
Why am I the blabbermouth?
You're the big mouth, Oh Pan Sool.

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:15.800
I'm a man of discretion.
My lips are sealed.

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:18.370
When I'm out, I don't open my mouth
unless I'm eating.

00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:20.900
So my friends say, "a man's word
is his bond" was a saying...

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:22.670
made up just for me.

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:26.810
"A man's word is his bond"?
Don't make me laugh.

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:29.850
Your word isn't your bond.
It's more like bubble gum.

00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:33.120
How often have you gotten into trouble
for running your big mouth?

00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:36.420
My beautiful wife.
Do you want me to scold you...

00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:38.490
until you’re breathless, farting,
and drooling all over yourself?

00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:41.060
Even if I'm a blabbermouth,
I'm still more tight-lipped than you.

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:44.930
When you die, your mouth will rot first
from all the flapping you do.

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:48.200
- What is it, you handsome old geezer?
- You sexy old broad!

00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:49.600
- Darn you.
- Darn you!

00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:52.970
- All you do is mutter...
- Zip it!

00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:57.070
(Mingang Distribution)

00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:59.540
I don't know what
Min Kyung Chae's next move will be.

00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:02.580
The only thing I'm sure of
is that she'll stop at nothing.

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:05.080
After she came all the way
to Madam Jang's place...

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:07.250
only to be humiliated by her daughter,

00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:08.920
she can't be in her right mind.

00:24:16.290 --> 00:24:17.390
It's Min Kyung Chae.

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:21.600
I'm going to kill myself today.

00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:23.830
My own daughter has rejected me...

00:24:24.370 --> 00:24:26.570
and won't accept me as her mother.
What's the point of living anymore?

00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:28.610
Let's meet one last time.

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:30.910
Se Ri's mother to mother.

00:24:31.810 --> 00:24:33.410
I'll be waiting for you
at the Andeok Reservoir.

00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:47.460
You're not actually going, are you?

00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:52.430
I have to.
She asked to see me mother to mother.

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:54.330
Then, I'll go with you.

00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:57.600
No. I'll go by myself.

00:24:58.170 --> 00:25:00.170
It could be a trap.

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:03.770
She could be using suicide talk
to lure you just to hurt you.

00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:07.780
Even if that's true,
we need to settle this once and for all.

00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:09.610
I'll go alone.

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:28.130
So you came.
I guess threatening to die works.

00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:36.410
Whether you live or die is up to fate,
but before that happens,

00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:40.710
you need to tell the press
what happened to Mi So four years ago...

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:43.750
and issue a formal apology
as the CEO of Mingang Distribution.

00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:46.850
And beg forgiveness...

00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:49.320
for making Mi So the guilty party
with your lies.

00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:53.290
And acknowledge and accept Mi So.

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:56.660
Just like Se Ri is both my daughter
and your daughter,

00:25:57.090 --> 00:25:58.800
the same goes for Mi So.

00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:01.000
I told you I have nothing to do
with that girl.

00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:04.430
I said not to mention your dead daughter
in relation to me again.

00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:06.240
You really have nothing to do with her?

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:08.770
Denying it with all your might
won't make it untrue.

00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:12.040
The feeling of her kicking inside you.

00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:16.580
Mothers remember that feeling.

00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:20.020
No, I don't remember.

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:22.850
I feel absolutely nothing for her.

00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:25.060
Someone with no feelings
would deny it this desperately?

00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:28.090
If you truly felt nothing,
you wouldn't be acting this way.

00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:30.290
You...

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:33.500
For ten months as an unwed mother,

00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:37.030
it must have been so hard for you,
hiding it from the world.

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:39.270
I know what that's like.

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:41.770
Because I went through the same thing.

00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:45.640
So instead of blaming yourself,

00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:50.580
you can still acknowledge and accept her
as your daughter.

00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:57.290
Do you know how smart Mi So was?

00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:01.190
She took after you and your sharp mind.

00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:02.830
She was always at the top of her class.

00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:09.170
Her picky eating always bugged me,

00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:13.670
but now I realize she gets that from you.

00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:17.040
And her face...

00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:21.510
She's the spitting image of you.

00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:24.350
Her eyes, her nose, her mouth.

00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:27.280
There's not a single feature
that isn't yours.

00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:34.790
No, I'm not her mother.

00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:37.160
What makes you think I'm her mother?

00:27:38.530 --> 00:27:41.460
- I said I'm not.
- Why are you doing this? Let me go!

00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:43.130
I should be asking you that!
Why are you doing this?

00:27:43.570 --> 00:27:45.000
- Why?
- Let go!

00:27:45.070 --> 00:27:48.540
- Why on earth are you doing this to me?
- I said, let go of me!

00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:35.790
