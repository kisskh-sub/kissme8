00:16.120 --> 00:20.880
Jess! Maddy and I are ready
to put the star on the tree!

00:21.760 --> 00:23.120
Are you ready?

00:24.280 --> 00:25.640
Trevor,

00:25.720 --> 00:29.680
I hope you haven't dressed Maddy
in that ridiculous costume you bought.

00:29.760 --> 00:33.760
-Take a look in the five and ten
-It's glistening once again…

00:33.840 --> 00:36.600
-Oh!
-Are you ready, Maddy? Put the star…

00:36.680 --> 00:37.520
Go on.

00:37.600 --> 00:39.560
…on the tree.

00:40.160 --> 00:42.400
-Yeah!
-Yay! Hay-hay-hay!

00:42.480 --> 00:44.840
Okay, Maddy.

00:45.360 --> 00:46.400
Can you reach?

00:46.920 --> 00:48.720
Oh. Here, let me do it.

00:48.800 --> 00:50.440
The holly that will be…

00:53.840 --> 00:55.920
-Trevor! Trevor!
-I think I've broken something.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.120
Maddy, come on. Come on.

00:58.200 --> 01:00.960
You always put the star on the tree.

01:01.040 --> 01:02.560
Mom, no.

01:02.640 --> 01:05.520
And the thing that will make them ring
Is the carol…

01:05.600 --> 01:07.560
-Right.
-Okay.

01:09.240 --> 01:11.120
Happy Christmas, Dad.

01:32.680 --> 01:35.200
It's time to get
your long johns on, Hertfordshire,

01:35.280 --> 01:36.480
because it is cold out there,

01:36.560 --> 01:39.360
and forecasters now predicting
a very white Christmas.

01:39.440 --> 01:41.480
Oh, goodness.

01:44.200 --> 01:45.440
Children playing

01:46.720 --> 01:48.080
Having fun…

01:57.200 --> 01:58.840
Oh, no.

02:06.600 --> 02:07.680
Ah!

02:17.200 --> 02:19.560
The 21st.

02:19.640 --> 02:20.680
Ah!

02:23.560 --> 02:24.600
Ah.

02:27.800 --> 02:28.840
Ah.

02:30.440 --> 02:31.640
Mmm.

02:31.720 --> 02:32.760
Mmm!

02:42.040 --> 02:43.000
Ah.

03:03.040 --> 03:04.040
Uh.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.160
Ooh.

03:08.320 --> 03:10.120
Very nice.

03:19.760 --> 03:22.040
Oh, Jess. Hang on.

03:25.000 --> 03:25.840
Oh.

03:30.120 --> 03:31.680
Okay, I'm outside.

03:31.760 --> 03:34.920
Outside?
What are you doing outside, Trevor?

03:35.000 --> 03:35.920
It's freezing.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.960
Well, it's just the reception.
It's a bit patchy around here, I'm afraid.

03:40.760 --> 03:43.000
But it's a lovely place, Jess.

03:43.520 --> 03:46.240
When you and Maddy come over,
I'll show you the village.

03:46.320 --> 03:50.520
-'Cause they've got this wonderful--
-That's actually why I'm calling, Trevor.

03:51.040 --> 03:54.080
We've had the most amazing invitation.

03:54.680 --> 03:57.840
I think I might have mentioned
my new boyfriend to you.

03:58.560 --> 03:59.680
Goran?

03:59.760 --> 04:00.680
Oh, yes.

04:00.760 --> 04:03.440
Well, he's got this villa in Barbados and…

04:03.520 --> 04:06.760
Well, he's invited Maddy and me
to join him there for Christmas.

04:07.480 --> 04:08.640
Oh.

04:08.720 --> 04:09.760
Uh…

04:09.840 --> 04:10.680
So--

04:10.760 --> 04:12.920
I thought it was
just the perfect way to celebrate

04:13.000 --> 04:15.280
Maddy getting onto her course in Paris.

04:16.040 --> 04:16.880
Right.

04:16.960 --> 04:18.520
But it does mean flying out tomorrow.

04:18.600 --> 04:19.600
So I'm really sorry,

04:19.680 --> 04:22.000
but we won't be able
to join you after all.

04:23.840 --> 04:25.880
Oh. Okay.

04:25.960 --> 04:28.280
But we'll be right back
after New Year's, so,

04:28.360 --> 04:30.600
why don't we aim to have a drink then?

04:31.200 --> 04:33.240
Yes. Yes.

04:33.320 --> 04:34.800
I've got some good news.

04:35.400 --> 04:38.920
I know what a challenge the fees
for the Sorbonne were going to be,

04:39.000 --> 04:42.360
but Goran gets on
so incredibly well with Maddy,

04:42.440 --> 04:45.040
he'd very much
like to cover the cost himself.

04:45.880 --> 04:50.360
Oh. Oh, no. I've got plenty of, um-- Uh…

04:50.440 --> 04:53.040
-I'll be absolutely fine.
-Morning, Trevor.

04:53.760 --> 04:54.920
Oh, morning.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.160
Well, okay.

04:56.680 --> 04:57.920
If you're sure.

05:01.200 --> 05:02.080
And look…

05:02.160 --> 05:04.360
Have a very merry Christmas.

05:04.440 --> 05:06.320
Uh, yes. And the same to you.

05:06.400 --> 05:07.280
Bye.

05:07.360 --> 05:09.360
And to Maddy.

05:30.760 --> 05:32.840
Hi, Maddy. It's Dad here.

05:32.920 --> 05:35.360
Sorry, I've never left a voice note,
so I hope this works.

05:35.440 --> 05:37.760
-Morning, Trevor. Big day.
-Morning. Morning.

05:37.840 --> 05:39.080
Um, anyway,

05:39.160 --> 05:43.440
I just wanted to say that I hope
you have a wonderful time in Barbados.

05:43.520 --> 05:45.760
Gosh. What a treat.

05:45.840 --> 05:48.520
But I'd love to have
a quick word before you go,

05:48.600 --> 05:52.200
because… because I'm going to miss you,
sweet pea.

05:52.280 --> 05:53.440
So much.

05:53.520 --> 05:54.680
Morning, Trevor.

05:54.760 --> 05:56.320
Oh, Tom. Hello.

05:57.160 --> 05:59.280
So… so maybe speak later.

05:59.800 --> 06:00.800
Okay?

06:00.880 --> 06:02.040
Bye.

06:02.120 --> 06:04.240
And then I just lift my thumb off.

06:04.320 --> 06:05.560
Eh, good.

06:11.440 --> 06:13.880
-Trevor. Trevor.
-Oh, hello, Diana. How are you?

06:13.960 --> 06:16.720
We are going to need
those extra chairs, please. Thank you.

06:16.800 --> 06:20.320
-Yes. I'll get my coat off and then I'll--
-Soon as you can, please, Trevor.

06:20.400 --> 06:21.800
Yes. Yes.

06:21.880 --> 06:23.840
Go and check the manger, please.
Thank you.

06:23.920 --> 06:26.600
And Mrs. A., would you mind
clearing this box from the--

06:26.680 --> 06:30.160
Oh, one second. Can I have a…
That's a bit flimsy. Never mind.

06:30.240 --> 06:32.480
Oh, no, not there, Trevor.

06:32.560 --> 06:34.160
No, they need to go at the back.

06:34.240 --> 06:35.960
At the back. Right.

06:36.040 --> 06:39.680
Also, um, we're still missing
a "No Vacancy" sign for the inn.

06:39.760 --> 06:40.600
Okay.

06:41.120 --> 06:43.040
And straw for the stable.

06:43.120 --> 06:44.040
Oh, right.

06:44.560 --> 06:47.320
And I don't think the bulb
for the Christmas star is working.

06:47.400 --> 06:48.920
Right. Let me just, um…

06:49.000 --> 06:54.120
Now, uh, teas and coffees.
Mrs. André, can I get you a tea?

06:56.440 --> 06:58.840
-Oh! Trevor. Could I have a word?
-Um…

06:58.920 --> 07:00.280
-Thank you so much.
-Trevor?

07:00.360 --> 07:01.960
-Oh…
-Ah! Diana.

07:02.640 --> 07:04.880
I hear you've had a bit of a coup
on the Baby Jesus front.

07:04.960 --> 07:08.240
Oh, yes. I think you know June,
Jennifer's mom?

07:08.320 --> 07:11.600
She's going to be dropping off
her eight-month-old before curtain-up.

07:11.680 --> 07:14.000
A real baby in our manger
for the first time.

07:14.080 --> 07:16.560
-We're all very excited.
-Cannot wait.

07:17.360 --> 07:18.800
Trevor, I'll take those.

07:20.400 --> 07:21.720
Do take a seat.

07:21.800 --> 07:22.800
Thank you.

07:25.880 --> 07:30.160
Now, I believe you and I, Trevor,
have an occasion to mark.

07:31.440 --> 07:32.280
Uh…

07:36.800 --> 07:39.640
Not just the last day of term,
but your last day at the school.

07:39.720 --> 07:40.800
Isn't that right?

07:40.880 --> 07:41.960
Oh.

07:42.040 --> 07:43.400
Yes, that's right.

07:44.160 --> 07:46.560
I really am genuinely sorry
we had to let you go.

07:46.640 --> 07:48.600
But on behalf of all of us
here at St. Aldwyn's,

07:48.680 --> 07:52.160
I just wanted to thank you for everything
you've done for the school in the last…

07:52.920 --> 07:54.160
How long has it been?

07:54.760 --> 07:56.120
Seven months.

07:56.200 --> 07:57.440
Gosh.

07:58.200 --> 07:59.480
Feels like years.

08:01.320 --> 08:02.680
Cheers.

08:09.400 --> 08:12.320
So, have you got anything else lined up?

08:13.040 --> 08:15.560
Uh, no. No, not as such.

08:18.480 --> 08:20.960
Well, thank you again.
And happy Christmas.

08:32.240 --> 08:34.320
-Ah!
-…for the production.

08:35.360 --> 08:37.280
Can somebody get the back door, please?

08:41.280 --> 08:42.440
Trevor?

08:56.120 --> 08:56.960
Huh.

08:59.840 --> 09:01.240
June?

09:02.320 --> 09:03.640
June?

09:14.280 --> 09:15.120
Well…

09:15.200 --> 09:16.320
Mary, perfect.

09:16.400 --> 09:18.240
Wise Man One.

09:19.400 --> 09:20.240
Perfect.

09:20.320 --> 09:22.280
Excuse me. Diana.

09:22.360 --> 09:25.200
I didn't see June, but there was a baby.

09:25.280 --> 09:26.280
Oh…

09:30.040 --> 09:32.800
Well, don't just stand there, Trevor.
Put it in the manger.

09:33.680 --> 09:35.040
Here we go.

09:35.560 --> 09:36.640
Are you ready?

09:38.240 --> 09:39.840
There we are.

09:42.760 --> 09:43.680
Hello, you.

09:57.480 --> 09:58.320
Trevor!

10:13.440 --> 10:17.160
Tonight, we tell a story, old and true,

10:17.240 --> 10:20.520
of a baby named Jesus,
born for me and you.

10:21.600 --> 10:24.080
Nine thousand pounds! Ooh…

10:24.160 --> 10:27.640
And now our story begins in a land so far,

10:27.720 --> 10:29.840
where Mary and Joseph…

10:29.920 --> 10:30.760
Oh, dear!

10:30.840 --> 10:32.280
…travel under the guiding star.

10:32.360 --> 10:35.280
-Trevor! Hooves!
-Oh!

10:48.480 --> 10:53.240
Joseph, the night grows cold,
and the wind is cruel.

10:56.280 --> 10:59.360
Do not worry, Mary,
we will find the place,

10:59.440 --> 11:01.280
pulled by this humble mule.

11:03.520 --> 11:06.800
The journey is long,
but their hearts are strong…

11:06.880 --> 11:07.720
Hello?

11:07.800 --> 11:11.760
Buenos días, señora.
May I speak with Mr. Trevor Binge-ly?

11:12.520 --> 11:14.000
It's "Bingley."

11:14.080 --> 11:16.080
Trevor Bingley. Yes, that's me.

11:16.160 --> 11:18.520
But I'm sorry,
this isn't really a very good time.

11:18.600 --> 11:21.560
Señor Bingley, I am so pleased
to make your acquaintance.

11:21.640 --> 11:24.960
I am Cesar Jimenez
from the personnel department

11:25.040 --> 11:27.120
of Grupo del Sanchez Romero.

11:28.080 --> 11:30.320
Okay. I don't know…

11:30.400 --> 11:33.320
The new parent company
of Housesitters Deluxe.

11:34.960 --> 11:36.760
Oh, right.

11:36.840 --> 11:40.720
We don't have any room in the inn,
though your need is clear.

11:40.800 --> 11:43.760
The thing is that, um,
due to the recent change in ownership,

11:43.840 --> 11:45.840
our Barcelona team is not…

11:45.920 --> 11:48.280
Sorry, could I leave you
for just one minute, please?

12:02.080 --> 12:03.520
Sorry. You were saying?

12:04.360 --> 12:08.960
I was saying that our, uh,
Barcelona team is not entirely familiar

12:09.040 --> 12:11.400
with all of the Housesitters staff.

12:11.480 --> 12:13.840
But you are still on our books.

12:13.920 --> 12:14.800
…bright,

12:14.880 --> 12:18.680
Three Wise Men draw near
on this holy night.

12:19.520 --> 12:22.840
And I am calling
because we've had a member of staff

12:22.920 --> 12:25.240
cancel due to a family emergency.

12:25.320 --> 12:28.200
Behold! The star! Rising in the East!

12:28.800 --> 12:31.520
And we were wondering
if you might be available to take over

12:31.600 --> 12:35.360
a platinum-level house-sitting job
over the Christmas period.

12:37.560 --> 12:40.360
Oh. No, I don't really do
that kind of thing anymore.

12:40.440 --> 12:44.280
In case you were wondering,
it pays around £10,000.

12:48.960 --> 12:50.560
Ten thousand pounds?

12:50.640 --> 12:53.480
Calm. Calm. Anyone hit? Anyone hurt?

12:53.560 --> 12:57.160
Full disclosure, uh, you would
have to attend an interview on site

12:57.240 --> 12:59.320
in London this evening at 5:00 p.m.

12:59.400 --> 13:02.800
And, if approved, start immediately.

13:03.400 --> 13:06.400
So, do you think you might be available?

13:07.000 --> 13:08.840
Well, yes.

14:12.960 --> 14:15.040
What are you doing here?

14:25.080 --> 14:26.720
Where's your mom?

14:28.960 --> 14:30.920
Let's go and find her, shall we?

14:34.280 --> 14:37.600
Okay. Here we go.

14:37.680 --> 14:41.880
Right. Parents' directory.
Parents' directory.

14:43.320 --> 14:45.320
June. June. June.

14:45.400 --> 14:48.480
June! There we go. June Harbinson.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.840
Right.

14:54.200 --> 14:55.720
Okay.

14:55.800 --> 14:57.880
Don't worry, we'll soon get you home.

14:57.960 --> 14:59.600
Hello! You've reached June.

14:59.680 --> 15:02.920
I can't come to the phone right now,
but you know what to do.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.520
Hello, June? It's Mr. Bingley from school.

15:07.600 --> 15:12.040
I didn't see you at the play,
but it seems we've still got your baby.

15:12.640 --> 15:13.640
Can you let me know

15:13.720 --> 15:15.920
when you might be able
to come and pick it up?

15:16.000 --> 15:17.960
Okay, thanks. Thanks, bye.

15:22.920 --> 15:24.440
What time is it?

15:28.800 --> 15:32.680
June, hello. I'm in a little bit
of a rush to catch a train to London,

15:32.760 --> 15:36.520
so I thought I'd just pop 'round now
and drop the baby off, if that's okay?

15:38.720 --> 15:40.880
Oh, hello, June. I've got…

15:41.360 --> 15:42.200
Oh.

15:42.800 --> 15:46.160
Oh. I know. Poor little thing.

15:46.240 --> 15:49.360
She woke up with a bit of a sniffle,
so I called the school and left a message

15:49.440 --> 15:51.880
to say I wouldn't be
bringing her in after all.

15:52.960 --> 15:54.560
Right.

15:54.640 --> 15:57.000
Aww.

15:57.080 --> 15:59.240
So, who's this little chap, then?

16:01.280 --> 16:02.800
Um…

16:12.000 --> 16:13.160
The baby?

16:13.240 --> 16:16.600
Yes. It turned out
that June didn't bring her baby to school,

16:16.680 --> 16:17.960
so the baby that was left

16:18.040 --> 16:22.000
at the back door that we put in the manger
must have belonged to somebody else,

16:22.080 --> 16:25.240
and whoever that was
hasn't come back to pick it up yet, so I--

16:25.320 --> 16:27.520
Trevor! I'm sorry, I'm in the car.

16:27.600 --> 16:29.040
I'm going away.

16:29.120 --> 16:31.440
I don't really have time
to sort this out right now.

16:31.520 --> 16:33.680
Look, why don't I pop it
on the parents' WhatsApp group

16:33.760 --> 16:36.800
and then refer any calls to you?
Is that all right?

16:36.880 --> 16:39.960
Well, the thing is,
I have to go to London.

16:40.040 --> 16:44.280
And I have to go to Lanzarote, Trevor.
Tonight. With my entire family.

16:44.360 --> 16:46.360
And I'm already
an hour late for the airport.

16:46.440 --> 16:47.760
Uh, well, the…

16:47.840 --> 16:50.400
I'll pop it on the group chat now, okay?

16:51.920 --> 16:53.160
Hello?

16:54.720 --> 16:56.680
Oh, dear.

16:58.800 --> 17:00.600
Now what?

17:03.920 --> 17:05.080
A baby?

17:05.600 --> 17:07.200
Yes. It's a bit of a long story,

17:07.280 --> 17:10.480
but, basically,
it was left at St. Aldwyn's School,

17:10.560 --> 17:12.440
and then nobody came back to pick it up.

17:12.520 --> 17:14.720
-And who are you?
-Trevor Bingley.

17:14.800 --> 17:17.120
I'm the school caretaker.

17:17.200 --> 17:19.520
Well, I was the school caretaker.

17:19.600 --> 17:21.520
Okay. Well, look,
the weather's not helping us,

17:21.600 --> 17:24.080
but we should be able
to get a patrol car out to you in…

17:24.880 --> 17:26.720
oh, three to four hours?

17:27.200 --> 17:28.160
Oh.

17:28.640 --> 17:32.120
Oh, unfortunately, I'm supposed to be
in London at five o'clock.

17:32.200 --> 17:35.600
Your only chance of getting anyone
sooner would be to try social services.

17:35.680 --> 17:37.200
Oh.

17:39.920 --> 17:41.080
Hello, social services.

17:41.160 --> 17:43.240
-Hello. My name is Trevor Bingley.
-Right.

17:43.320 --> 17:46.520
-I've got a baby left at a school play.
-And…

17:46.600 --> 17:48.480
And you've still got this baby?

17:48.560 --> 17:54.400
Yes. And the thing is,
I need to leave in sort of 45 minutes.

17:54.480 --> 17:55.760
Um, so I was really hoping

17:55.840 --> 17:58.560
that someone might be able
to come around and pick it up before then.

18:00.080 --> 18:02.600
Okay. Uh, well, look.

18:02.680 --> 18:05.640
I'll come and get it myself.
Can I just take some details?

18:05.720 --> 18:08.240
Oh, thank you. Thank you so much.

18:13.880 --> 18:16.440
Deck the halls with boughs of holly

18:16.520 --> 18:18.920
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la

18:19.000 --> 18:21.480
'Tis the season to be jolly

18:21.560 --> 18:24.000
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la

18:24.080 --> 18:26.640
Don we now our gay apparel

18:26.720 --> 18:29.200
Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la

18:29.280 --> 18:31.720
Troll the ancient Yuletide carol

18:31.800 --> 18:33.280
Fa-la-la-la-la, la--

18:35.720 --> 18:36.760
Baby?

18:37.720 --> 18:38.560
Baby?

18:42.800 --> 18:45.240
No! No! No! No! No!

18:45.320 --> 18:47.720
Where do you think you're going?

18:49.040 --> 18:50.000
Oh!

18:50.080 --> 18:52.480
He's here. He's here!

18:53.760 --> 18:55.760
Okay. Right.

18:57.520 --> 18:58.640
Here we go.

19:01.440 --> 19:03.840
Mr. Bingley.
Hertfordshire Social Services.

19:03.920 --> 19:06.080
Oh, thank you.
Thank you so much for coming.

19:06.680 --> 19:07.760
I'm in a bit of a rush,

19:07.840 --> 19:10.880
because I've got
to catch a train to London.

19:11.480 --> 19:15.120
Okay. Right. Well, the baby is…

19:18.360 --> 19:20.320
here…

19:21.240 --> 19:24.400
somewhere.

19:24.920 --> 19:26.280
Where are you?

19:27.120 --> 19:29.440
Where's that baby gone?

19:30.960 --> 19:33.400
Uh… Oh, dear me.

19:33.480 --> 19:35.880
Um, baby?

19:35.960 --> 19:37.480
Sorry. Just one moment.

19:37.560 --> 19:40.440
Perhaps in here. Baby?

19:41.360 --> 19:44.560
Baby? Baby!

19:44.640 --> 19:47.400
Sorry. He's definitely here somewhere.

19:48.440 --> 19:53.160
So, you found this baby in a manger?

19:53.840 --> 19:57.240
Yes. He's Baby Jesus.

19:58.040 --> 20:00.880
Baby? Baby?

20:01.400 --> 20:08.320
Jesus? I can't see you!
Jesus? Jesus, where are you?

20:08.840 --> 20:09.800
Well, look, um,

20:09.880 --> 20:12.480
w-- w-- why don't I just leave you to it?

20:13.280 --> 20:14.880
Where might you be?

20:14.960 --> 20:17.680
-Are you behind the television?
-Well…

20:17.760 --> 20:18.840
No.

20:18.920 --> 20:22.280
If you… if you do happen to find
this, uh, missing baby,

20:22.360 --> 20:25.760
then, uh, all-- all-- all of my details
are on that card.

20:25.840 --> 20:28.440
Are you in the coal scuttle?

20:29.120 --> 20:30.280
No.

20:30.360 --> 20:32.520
All right, well, cheerio.

20:34.320 --> 20:35.880
-Bye!
-Oh!

20:39.120 --> 20:39.960
Are you…?

20:40.040 --> 20:42.640
There you are!

20:45.320 --> 20:48.680
I've found it! I've found it!

20:50.640 --> 20:53.240
Oh, no! No!

20:53.320 --> 20:54.920
Oh!

20:55.000 --> 20:56.200
He left his card.

21:00.640 --> 21:01.800
Yes!

21:07.480 --> 21:09.480
This is Neil. I'm now on annual leave

21:09.560 --> 21:12.200
and won't be back
in the office until January 4th.

21:12.280 --> 21:14.160
No! No!

21:14.240 --> 21:17.200
I've got to go! I've got to go!

21:18.920 --> 21:21.880
Oh, I know. I'll drop you off on the way.

22:05.480 --> 22:07.360
Oh.

22:10.440 --> 22:12.360
What?

22:15.040 --> 22:17.920
All right. We need a plan B.

22:20.960 --> 22:23.280
-Hello, Hertfordshire Police.
-Oh, hello. Yes.

22:23.360 --> 22:25.080
I rang earlier about a baby,

22:25.160 --> 22:28.560
uh, that was left behind
at St. Aldwyn's School.

22:28.640 --> 22:29.880
Sorry. Just a second.

22:32.440 --> 22:33.480
There we go.

22:34.000 --> 22:37.000
You put me in touch
with social services, but unfortunately--

22:37.080 --> 22:38.440
Did we give you a case number, sir?

22:39.120 --> 22:40.920
Um, n-- n-- no.

22:41.000 --> 22:44.520
-Let's start with your last name, then.
-It's Bingley.

22:46.120 --> 22:48.520
Sorry, I didn't catch that.
Could you say that again for me?

22:48.600 --> 22:52.480
Um, last name is B-I-N…

22:55.080 --> 22:55.960
Hello?

22:56.800 --> 22:57.680
Hello?

22:58.360 --> 23:00.400
Reception's not good, sir,
but let's keep going.

23:00.480 --> 23:03.880
So the name's Mr. Bin? Is that correct?

23:03.960 --> 23:07.000
Well, it's "Bin" and then "gley."

23:07.520 --> 23:09.040
Got it. Bin Glee.

23:09.120 --> 23:11.360
So Bin's your first name, Mr. Glee?

23:13.080 --> 23:13.960
Hello?

23:14.040 --> 23:15.360
Hello? Hello?

23:17.160 --> 23:19.200
You're coming in and out a bit, sir.

23:19.280 --> 23:21.680
-Can you hear me now?
-Yes.

23:21.760 --> 23:24.360
Trevor Bingley. Called earlier.
Found baby left at school.

23:25.280 --> 23:27.200
-Sorry?
-Also reported social services.

23:27.280 --> 23:29.840
Now moving to new location,
but still on same number.

23:30.880 --> 23:32.120
Mr. Glee?

23:32.200 --> 23:34.640
Will send you address soonest
if I get job I'm going for.

23:36.920 --> 23:38.040
Oh, no.

23:43.840 --> 23:46.240
16:10 service to London Marylebone

23:46.320 --> 23:48.640
will depart from platform two.

23:49.280 --> 23:51.720

24:08.320 --> 24:11.200

24:11.800 --> 24:13.960
Twenty-nine…

24:18.160 --> 24:19.200

24:26.640 --> 24:28.040
