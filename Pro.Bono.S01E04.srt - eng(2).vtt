PRO BONO

00:00:37.433 --> 00:00:39.853
Mr. Kang!

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.605
You're going to sue Chairman Choi?

00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:44.482
What on earth are you doing?

00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:46.359
I'm filing a civil claim for damages.

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:48.570
But why did you say…

00:00:49.153 --> 00:00:51.489
"File a civil claim for damages."
That's too long.

00:00:51.573 --> 00:00:53.992
"I'll sue you."
That's much easier and simpler to say.

00:00:54.075 --> 00:00:56.494
It'll make for sexier headlines too.

00:00:57.203 --> 00:00:58.538
"Sexy"?

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.292
Do you think that
is an appropriate word for this case?

00:01:02.375 --> 00:01:05.837
It has to be sexy to grab attention,
and we have to grab attention

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.047
if we want more people to hear us out.

00:01:08.131 --> 00:01:10.675
We'll be holding a press conference,
so get ready.

00:01:11.176 --> 00:01:14.012
But no one usually comes
to press conferences of pro bono cases.

00:01:14.095 --> 00:01:16.848
Haven't you been listening?
We'll make it sexy to draw them in.

00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:20.101
Could you find me a hair salon?

00:01:20.185 --> 00:01:22.187
-You brat!
-Hair salon? What for?

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.397
-Isn't there one in your town?
-Of course, there is!

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.901
Hey, Stretch. How can you let
a kid be sharper than you?

00:01:27.984 --> 00:01:29.527
Sorry? But what did I…

00:01:29.611 --> 00:01:31.946
-Geez, that attention seeker.
-I can hear you!

00:01:34.073 --> 00:01:35.950
-Why a hair salon?
-Geez!

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:38.786
THE PEOPLE'S JUDGE SUES KOREA

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.040
You may now begin
to take Kim Gang-hun's photos.

00:01:46.878 --> 00:01:47.879
I'm sorry.

00:01:49.088 --> 00:01:50.590
I'm sure you all must be busy.

00:01:51.257 --> 00:01:53.259
Thank you for coming.

00:02:00.225 --> 00:02:03.770
You said you'd make Woongsan Group CEO
Choi Woong-san stand trial.

00:02:03.853 --> 00:02:06.940
It's an appeal trial for damages
against the hospital.

00:02:07.023 --> 00:02:08.650
Is it possible to add a defendant?

00:02:09.275 --> 00:02:11.110
That's a good observation, Ms. Park.

00:02:11.694 --> 00:02:14.697
You can't add a defendant
in an appeal trial.

00:02:14.781 --> 00:02:17.325
Therefore, in the appeal,

00:02:17.408 --> 00:02:21.663
I will prove the suffering
Gang-hun has felt up until now.

00:02:21.746 --> 00:02:25.333
And then, since the one truly responsible
is hiding behind the hospital,

00:02:25.416 --> 00:02:28.544
I'll file a separate lawsuit for damages

00:02:28.628 --> 00:02:31.631
against Chairman Choi Woong-san.

00:02:32.298 --> 00:02:36.719
If this appeal is the preliminary round,
then that trial would be the final match.

00:02:36.803 --> 00:02:39.639
It's going to be more intense and brutal.

00:02:42.475 --> 00:02:44.936
Brace yourself, Chairman.

00:02:47.397 --> 00:02:51.234
Okay, everyone.
We'll take just a few more questions.

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:54.696
Gang-hun is such a smart and mature kid.

00:02:54.779 --> 00:02:59.617
Did you say you got the courage to file
the lawsuit after watching Capernaum?

00:02:59.701 --> 00:03:02.203
What? Someone as young as him saw that?

00:03:02.286 --> 00:03:03.413
Do you like movies?

00:03:04.038 --> 00:03:07.166
Yes. For some strange reason,
I like those kinds of movies.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.878
My mom teases me for being an old soul.

00:03:12.922 --> 00:03:15.299
What's your favorite movie then?

00:03:16.175 --> 00:03:17.844
It's Forrest Gump.

00:03:18.511 --> 00:03:20.430
Right. The one where Tom Hanks
plays a disabled…

00:03:23.141 --> 00:03:26.394
Gang-hun and I have so much in common.

00:03:26.936 --> 00:03:27.770
First of all,

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.231
our handsome looks.

00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:33.151
That's pretty rare.

00:03:33.234 --> 00:03:35.570
Gang-hun is also a Go genius.

00:03:35.653 --> 00:03:36.654
Aren't you the top player

00:03:36.738 --> 00:03:38.322
-on online Go?
-No.

00:03:38.406 --> 00:03:40.700
-Yes, you are.
-I'm not.

00:03:40.783 --> 00:03:42.201
It's called Go! Go Game.

00:03:42.285 --> 00:03:44.787
I'm barely holding on
to first place in that game.

00:03:44.871 --> 00:03:47.874
What? Go! Go Game? I play that too.

00:03:47.957 --> 00:03:50.126
What is your username then?

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:51.919
AlphaGo911.

00:03:52.003 --> 00:03:53.463
"AlphaGo911"?

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:57.300
The renowned Go master,
AlphaGo911? That's you?

00:03:57.383 --> 00:04:01.054
My goodness. You're amazing.

00:04:01.137 --> 00:04:02.263
Not at all.

00:04:02.805 --> 00:04:03.639
I have…

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:06.267
a lot of free time on my hands.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.780
What on earth are you doing?

00:04:19.405 --> 00:04:20.615
My apologies, sir.

00:04:22.075 --> 00:04:26.079
How could you drag our CEO's name
into this joke of a trial?

00:04:26.162 --> 00:04:28.706
Is this what we're paying you
all that money for?

00:04:31.751 --> 00:04:34.670
My apologies. I'll stop it at all costs.

00:04:34.754 --> 00:04:38.132
If any inconvenience
happens upon the chairman,

00:04:38.216 --> 00:04:39.842
you'll be held responsible.

00:04:41.636 --> 00:04:42.595
Yes, sir.

00:04:43.221 --> 00:04:44.055
EPISODE 4

00:04:44.138 --> 00:04:46.182
You were amazing today, Gang-hun.

00:04:46.265 --> 00:04:47.975
It was tough, wasn't it?

00:04:48.643 --> 00:04:49.602
Are you all right?

00:04:50.436 --> 00:04:51.562
I'm fine.

00:04:52.605 --> 00:04:55.274
Anyway, did I do okay?

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.860
I didn't look arrogant, did I?

00:04:57.944 --> 00:05:01.781
People like it
when the disabled look pitiful.

00:05:01.864 --> 00:05:04.492
Don't think like that, Gang-hun.

00:05:07.829 --> 00:05:09.831
Anyways, so you like Forrest Gump?

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.083
I love that movie too.

00:05:12.708 --> 00:05:14.544
No, I don't like that movie.

00:05:15.378 --> 00:05:16.629
You don't?

00:05:17.713 --> 00:05:19.257
I only said I did.

00:05:20.049 --> 00:05:22.802
Honestly, the main character of the movie

00:05:23.428 --> 00:05:26.556
has difficulty walking
and an intellectual disability.

00:05:27.181 --> 00:05:29.016
But his mom says,

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.811
"Life is like a box of chocolates."

00:05:32.437 --> 00:05:35.314
"You never know what you're going to get."

00:05:36.691 --> 00:05:37.692
That's ridiculous.

00:05:38.818 --> 00:05:40.903
"Life is like a box of chocolates"?

00:05:41.821 --> 00:05:42.655
How?

00:05:44.782 --> 00:05:47.618
She knows perfectly well
that whatever you get will be garbage.

00:05:49.954 --> 00:05:51.956
Why did she lie to her son?

00:06:01.048 --> 00:06:02.008
Gang-hun.

00:06:03.634 --> 00:06:05.428
Why wouldn't Forrest's mom know

00:06:06.012 --> 00:06:09.599
that her son would face
difficulties in his life?

00:06:09.682 --> 00:06:11.726
Why did she lie then?

00:06:13.269 --> 00:06:14.729
Maybe it's not a lie.

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:17.523
Maybe it was a desperate hope.

00:06:18.149 --> 00:06:19.317
Desperate hope?

00:06:19.901 --> 00:06:20.735
Yeah.

00:06:22.612 --> 00:06:24.447
In this unpredictable life,

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:26.741
you don't know
what kind of things may happen.

00:06:26.824 --> 00:06:29.911
But even if they leave
a bitter taste at first,

00:06:29.994 --> 00:06:32.455
she hopes things taste sweet
like chocolate in the end.

00:06:34.749 --> 00:06:38.711
She so desperately wished that to be true,
so maybe that's why she said that.

00:06:39.879 --> 00:06:42.632
She prayed her son's life
would be like a box of chocolates.

00:06:44.926 --> 00:06:47.136
It's time to go home now, Gang-hun.

00:06:47.845 --> 00:06:50.556
-Let's go to my car. I'll drop you off.
-Thank you.

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.099
Okay, Gang-hun. Let's get going.

00:06:53.392 --> 00:06:54.810
Let's go.

00:06:59.398 --> 00:07:00.399
Let's go.

00:07:01.108 --> 00:07:02.109
Mr. Kang.

00:07:03.486 --> 00:07:04.487
What is it?

00:07:06.614 --> 00:07:09.033
Stop using Gang-hun for a PR stunt.

00:07:10.076 --> 00:07:12.370
Using him? What are you talking about?

00:07:12.453 --> 00:07:14.705
-Gang-hun came to me on his own--
-He's still a kid.

00:07:14.789 --> 00:07:16.082
Don't you get it?

00:07:16.165 --> 00:07:18.459
He may seem mature, but he's just a kid.

00:07:19.043 --> 00:07:21.379
You made him stand
in front of reporters and TV cameras.

00:07:21.462 --> 00:07:23.005
Don't you get it, Ms. Park?

00:07:25.675 --> 00:07:28.719
I'm giving it my all
to fight for Gang-hun.

00:07:28.803 --> 00:07:31.806
There's already a Supreme Court precedent
that's going against him.

00:07:31.889 --> 00:07:33.099
If we don't do this,

00:07:33.182 --> 00:07:36.018
that presiding appellate judge
will dismiss the case immediately.

00:07:36.811 --> 00:07:38.271
We have to grab people's attention--

00:07:38.354 --> 00:07:41.023
Are you sure you're fighting for Gang-hun?

00:07:41.107 --> 00:07:41.941
What?

00:07:42.024 --> 00:07:43.943
You're not fighting for yourself, are you?

00:07:44.026 --> 00:07:46.988
Right, justice candidate
and the people's judge, Kang Da-wit?

00:08:00.418 --> 00:08:01.961
Do I look like that much of a scumbag?

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:07.300
I'm sorry. I crossed the--

00:08:07.383 --> 00:08:10.344
If you don't want to work
with a scumbag, quit the team.

00:08:10.428 --> 00:08:12.430
-Mr. Kang.
-Whether you like it or not,

00:08:12.513 --> 00:08:14.098
I came here to lead this team.

00:08:14.974 --> 00:08:18.561
Whether it's you or me, it looks like
one of us will have to leave.

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:24.859
I'm going to make a winning team.
If you don't like that, you can leave.

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:37.538
Why the long face though?

00:08:38.623 --> 00:08:39.498
What is it?

00:08:40.625 --> 00:08:42.460
Do your team members not listen to you?

00:08:44.295 --> 00:08:45.296
No, it's just…

00:08:45.921 --> 00:08:46.756
Just?

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:49.091
There's someone
who makes me uncomfortable.

00:08:49.592 --> 00:08:50.426
Is that so?

00:08:51.302 --> 00:08:54.305
I wonder who could make
the great Kang Da-wit

00:08:54.847 --> 00:08:56.098
feel uncomfortable.

00:08:56.891 --> 00:08:59.393
Well, they're all crazy,
so they all make me uncomfortable.

00:09:00.186 --> 00:09:01.604
Don't worry. I'll handle it.

00:09:03.981 --> 00:09:04.940
Thank you.

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:14.241
By the way, Da-wit.
It's okay to make things a big event,

00:09:14.325 --> 00:09:15.785
but let's not cross the line.

00:09:15.868 --> 00:09:16.911
What line?

00:09:18.329 --> 00:09:21.165
That kid was cute.
The adorable boy in the wheelchair.

00:09:22.124 --> 00:09:24.460
And Oh & Partners is helping that boy.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.003
That's very nice.

00:09:27.421 --> 00:09:30.132
But making a chaebol CEO stand trial?

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:32.802
You're going way over the line.

00:09:38.182 --> 00:09:41.477
Everyone clamored for me to fire you
at the management meeting,

00:09:42.061 --> 00:09:43.562
and I was barely able to prevent it.

00:09:43.646 --> 00:09:45.815
"It was just a show
to put pressure on the opponent."

00:09:46.399 --> 00:09:47.817
"You know he's good at doing that."

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:50.444
What if I wasn't putting on a show?
What would happen then?

00:09:56.951 --> 00:09:57.952
Hold on.

00:09:59.453 --> 00:10:03.958
It's been so long since I handled
a criminal case, so my memory's fuzzy.

00:10:06.043 --> 00:10:08.003
The Aggravated Punishment
of Specific Crimes Act.

00:10:08.087 --> 00:10:10.214
If the amount of a bribe
is over 100 million won,

00:10:11.173 --> 00:10:12.508
what was the penalty?

00:10:15.344 --> 00:10:17.304
Life imprisonment or…

00:10:19.598 --> 00:10:20.599
Right.

00:10:20.683 --> 00:10:23.352
Imprisonment for at least ten years.
Am I right?

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:29.316
So you saw the video.

00:10:32.027 --> 00:10:34.864
This is a bar.
Why aren't you drinking? Come on.

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:03.058
Geez, my phone.

00:11:14.069 --> 00:11:15.780
What is this noise?

00:11:23.787 --> 00:11:27.625
RESTING AREA

00:11:34.423 --> 00:11:35.424
Ms. Park?

00:11:36.342 --> 00:11:39.595
Oh, my gosh! So that was you, Mr. Kang.

00:11:40.429 --> 00:11:43.265
-What brings you here at this hour?
-That's what I want to ask you.

00:11:43.349 --> 00:11:45.559
And what are those things in your hands?

00:11:48.437 --> 00:11:49.313
These?

00:11:50.606 --> 00:11:51.815
Let's put those down

00:11:51.899 --> 00:11:53.692
and talk like rational people.

00:11:53.776 --> 00:11:56.779
I didn't really mean it earlier
when I told you to leave the team.

00:11:58.697 --> 00:12:00.658
I was just doing a bit of sword dancing.

00:12:02.409 --> 00:12:03.827
What kind of nonsense is that?

00:12:04.745 --> 00:12:07.998
Why would an attorney suddenly be
sword dancing in the middle of the night?

00:12:09.959 --> 00:12:11.126
Exactly.

00:12:12.211 --> 00:12:13.337
It all started…

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:16.715
because of this law firm.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.221
Don't you have enough experience
to not be that naive anymore?

00:12:22.805 --> 00:12:25.641
Stop thinking about useless things
and focus on the numbers.

00:12:25.724 --> 00:12:28.018
Revenue, costs, profits.

00:12:29.144 --> 00:12:30.187
Right, everyone?

00:12:30.271 --> 00:12:31.355
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

00:12:31.939 --> 00:12:33.107
Okay, that's it for today.

00:12:35.401 --> 00:12:38.237
Gosh, Park. You're still such a kid.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:39.321
How adorable.

00:12:39.989 --> 00:12:42.533
Park, let's get it together.

00:12:42.616 --> 00:12:45.202
We're professionals. Don't hurt the team.

00:12:47.371 --> 00:12:49.540
The life of a law firm associate

00:12:49.623 --> 00:12:51.625
was filled
with a constant stream of stress.

00:12:52.626 --> 00:12:55.379
I despised my senior colleagues.

00:12:55.462 --> 00:12:57.840
I was afraid I'd end up
getting thrown out at that rate,

00:12:57.923 --> 00:12:59.592
so I looked for a place to let off steam.

00:13:03.178 --> 00:13:04.179
Incredible!

00:13:09.893 --> 00:13:11.854
Mr. Bae?

00:13:15.399 --> 00:13:16.900
No!

00:13:45.888 --> 00:13:46.972
You.

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:50.225
Are you here to learn sword dancing?

00:13:51.268 --> 00:13:53.562
No, I was just looking…

00:13:53.646 --> 00:13:54.480
Learn it.

00:13:55.064 --> 00:13:56.273
I see you're filled with rage.

00:13:56.899 --> 00:13:59.109
You should learn it
so you don't get sick from stress.

00:14:02.321 --> 00:14:03.322
Sick from stress?

00:14:06.784 --> 00:14:10.120
-And so, you learned to sword dance?
-Yes.

00:14:10.204 --> 00:14:12.206
My teacher was spot on.

00:14:13.624 --> 00:14:16.960
Whenever my senior colleagues
made me angry, I danced like crazy.

00:14:37.564 --> 00:14:38.857
Hey, you.

00:14:40.734 --> 00:14:41.694
Yes, ma'am?

00:14:43.946 --> 00:14:47.032
Would you like to be my successor?

00:14:48.909 --> 00:14:52.037
-Sorry?
-You're a natural.

00:14:52.121 --> 00:14:55.833
A nerd's level of concentration
is scary indeed.

00:14:56.667 --> 00:14:59.920
It had been a while, but a certain someone
made me want to dance.

00:15:03.132 --> 00:15:04.383
Excuse me.

00:15:05.092 --> 00:15:06.176
Hold on.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.804
If the senior colleagues you despised
made you dance,

00:15:08.887 --> 00:15:10.222
then tonight--

00:15:13.517 --> 00:15:15.102
Gosh, you make me uncomfortable.

00:15:21.984 --> 00:15:23.277
GAME RESULT
WIN

00:15:24.862 --> 00:15:26.363
I learned some good moves today.

00:15:27.698 --> 00:15:31.243
How many times have I beaten you?
I told you you're no match for me.

00:15:31.326 --> 00:15:32.995
When are you going to give up?

00:15:34.329 --> 00:15:36.707
As you know, I never give up.

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:39.001
-I have lots of time.
-Okay. I'll play with you again.

00:15:39.585 --> 00:15:41.462
Challenge me again next week.

00:15:43.172 --> 00:15:45.466
What? Do you have something to say?

00:15:47.134 --> 00:15:50.012
I saw you in the news, AlphaGo911.

00:15:50.095 --> 00:15:51.013
What?

00:15:51.096 --> 00:15:53.557
Kim Gang-hun is your name, isn't it?

00:16:02.274 --> 00:16:03.567
Welcome back.

00:16:05.152 --> 00:16:06.236
You were on the news.

00:16:07.738 --> 00:16:09.490
Yeah, probably.

00:16:09.573 --> 00:16:10.783
"Probably"?

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:18.415
I saw your interview. Did you file
the lawsuit because of that movie?

00:16:19.083 --> 00:16:20.084
What?

00:16:20.876 --> 00:16:21.877
Yeah.

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:23.754
You're doing it to punish me, aren't you?

00:16:23.837 --> 00:16:25.214
Mom, what's the matter?

00:16:25.297 --> 00:16:26.757
I know it's true!

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:28.634
That movie!

00:16:28.717 --> 00:16:30.677
It's about a kid
suing his neglectful parents

00:16:30.761 --> 00:16:32.763
for giving birth to him!

00:16:33.555 --> 00:16:36.266
Is that how you really feel?

00:16:41.021 --> 00:16:42.481
You should have sued me then.

00:16:45.025 --> 00:16:48.612
Not God and a hospital!

00:16:50.656 --> 00:16:52.199
Answer me, Kim Gang-hun!

00:16:55.077 --> 00:16:56.829
I see right through you.

00:17:00.165 --> 00:17:01.416
ADOPTING A DISABLED CHILD

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:02.709
Look.

00:17:03.627 --> 00:17:04.711
Look at it!

00:17:05.587 --> 00:17:07.714
You wanted to get on TV to be adopted.

00:17:07.798 --> 00:17:10.342
What? You want to go to America?

00:17:14.471 --> 00:17:15.889
Do you hate me that much?

00:17:17.891 --> 00:17:18.976
How could you…

00:17:20.018 --> 00:17:22.104
How could a mother-son relationship--

00:17:22.187 --> 00:17:24.314
Don't you hate your parents?

00:17:26.608 --> 00:17:27.860
What did you just say?

00:17:29.069 --> 00:17:31.029
That music box you love so much…

00:17:31.613 --> 00:17:34.032
You said she left you
the day she bought you that.

00:17:34.116 --> 00:17:36.201
You still like someone like that?

00:17:36.285 --> 00:17:37.286
Kim Gang-hun,

00:17:37.953 --> 00:17:39.454
I told you.

00:17:39.538 --> 00:17:41.748
Our family went bankrupt,
so because of debt--

00:17:41.832 --> 00:17:44.459
I guess parents abandon
their children during hard times too.

00:17:45.252 --> 00:17:46.628
You should've abandoned me too!

00:17:46.712 --> 00:17:48.046
Kim Gang-hun!

00:18:22.039 --> 00:18:23.165
Okay.

00:18:23.248 --> 00:18:27.419
What are you going to prove
in this appeal?

00:18:27.502 --> 00:18:29.588
The defendant
Woongsan General Hospital's fault

00:18:29.671 --> 00:18:32.466
in not diagnosing
and explaining the disability

00:18:32.549 --> 00:18:34.635
was already acknowledged
during the first trial.

00:18:34.718 --> 00:18:38.096
For the sole reason of not accepting
the plaintiff's life as damaging,

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:40.766
the plaintiff's claim was dismissed.

00:18:40.849 --> 00:18:42.851
Therefore, in this appeal trial,

00:18:42.935 --> 00:18:46.772
we will show what life is like
for people with disabilities

00:18:46.855 --> 00:18:50.150
to prove the damages
suffered by the plaintiff.

00:18:50.234 --> 00:18:53.904
I think the plaintiff's counsel
is a bit mistaken.

00:18:53.987 --> 00:18:56.949
Korea is an advanced country now
in every aspect.

00:18:57.616 --> 00:19:00.953
Welfare and equality for people
with disabilities are legally secured.

00:19:01.036 --> 00:19:02.871
Mobility rights
and transportation services.

00:19:02.955 --> 00:19:04.873
We've invested
an exorbitant amount of money

00:19:04.957 --> 00:19:07.125
to provide all sorts
of accessible facilities.

00:19:07.209 --> 00:19:10.754
What more do they want?

00:19:11.463 --> 00:19:14.466
Your Honor, did you just agree
with the defense?

00:19:15.092 --> 00:19:17.344
Pardon? No.

00:19:17.427 --> 00:19:18.387
I was just…

00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:22.474
-It was an unintentional--
-To refute what the defense just argued…

00:19:24.476 --> 00:19:26.186
we request an on-site inspection.

00:19:26.853 --> 00:19:29.481
What on earth is there to inspect on-site?

00:19:29.564 --> 00:19:32.150
If everything is exceptionally accessible
as you say it is,

00:19:32.234 --> 00:19:34.653
the judge can experience
the life of a disabled person

00:19:34.736 --> 00:19:36.530
and decide for himself.

00:19:36.613 --> 00:19:39.366
You seem to be interested.
Would you like to join him?

00:19:40.158 --> 00:19:41.285
Plaintiff's Counsel!

00:19:42.536 --> 00:19:45.038
Do you think this Court
has that much free time?

00:19:45.914 --> 00:19:46.957
Experience the life?

00:19:47.916 --> 00:19:50.669
If you keep this up,
I'll hold you in contempt--

00:19:50.752 --> 00:19:53.213
What is the issue at hand here,
Your Honor?

00:19:53.297 --> 00:19:55.382
-What?
-The issue is whether we can consider

00:19:55.465 --> 00:19:58.635
the plaintiff's life with disability
damaging or not.

00:19:58.719 --> 00:20:00.595
Aren't on-site inspections done

00:20:00.679 --> 00:20:03.348
so judges can form beliefs
from firsthand experience?

00:20:03.432 --> 00:20:05.267
That's what I did as a judge.

00:20:06.727 --> 00:20:08.854
Things must have changed a lot since then.

00:20:12.024 --> 00:20:13.275
Your Honor.

00:20:13.358 --> 00:20:17.487
The plaintiff's counsel is saying remarks
and requesting evidence unnecessarily

00:20:17.571 --> 00:20:19.948
-to delay the trial--
-In that case,

00:20:20.032 --> 00:20:24.661
I'll read you a newspaper interview

00:20:24.745 --> 00:20:28.540
that Woongsan Group CEO
Choi Woong-san participated in.

00:20:30.876 --> 00:20:33.378
"Our country has become
an advance country in every aspect."

00:20:33.462 --> 00:20:36.631
"But I believe we still lack consideration
for the socially marginalized,

00:20:36.715 --> 00:20:38.508
such as people with disabilities."

00:20:38.592 --> 00:20:45.182
"I, Choi Woong-san,
have a deep interest in this matter."

00:20:46.558 --> 00:20:50.645
Mr. Woo, could I submit a formal inquiry
to Chairman Choi Woong-san

00:20:50.729 --> 00:20:54.107
to see if his thoughts have changed?

00:20:54.191 --> 00:20:55.359
-I agree.
-What?

00:20:56.777 --> 00:20:58.320
Pardon? What did you say?

00:21:00.864 --> 00:21:05.327
I agree to the plaintiff's motion
for an on-site inspection.

00:21:06.036 --> 00:21:07.662
Please set the date, Your Honor.

00:21:28.892 --> 00:21:30.602
All right, are we good now?

00:21:31.353 --> 00:21:33.522
So we make our way
to court in these. Am I right?

00:21:34.022 --> 00:21:35.357
Just a moment.

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:38.527
What? What is it now?

00:21:39.111 --> 00:21:40.404
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

00:21:42.072 --> 00:21:44.199
Hey. Hold on.

00:21:44.282 --> 00:21:46.076
What are you doing?

00:21:46.159 --> 00:21:48.245
As you know, Gang-hun is a paraplegic.

00:21:48.328 --> 00:21:50.288
Please excuse me.
It's for an accurate inspection.

00:21:51.123 --> 00:21:51.998
Good grief.

00:21:56.670 --> 00:21:58.588
What are you doing? Move your foot.

00:21:58.672 --> 00:22:00.841
Here you go.

00:22:01.466 --> 00:22:02.592
Please gather your feet.

00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:04.928
Please be gentle.

00:22:05.011 --> 00:22:07.264
You're cutting off blood flow.
I have varicose veins!

00:22:13.603 --> 00:22:14.604
Geez.

00:22:15.439 --> 00:22:16.857
The streets are in good condition.

00:22:17.899 --> 00:22:20.944
What's there to complain about?
We'll be there in 15 minutes.

00:22:22.237 --> 00:22:23.530
Just a moment. Okay.

00:22:24.197 --> 00:22:26.324
Goodness. Thank you.

00:22:29.286 --> 00:22:31.037
Excuse me. Could you move the truck?

00:22:31.121 --> 00:22:32.372
Not now. Please wait.

00:22:32.455 --> 00:22:33.790
No. Please move now.

00:22:33.874 --> 00:22:35.667
Why are you blocking the sidewalk?

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:37.460
Forget it.

00:22:37.544 --> 00:22:39.129
We'll go around the front. It's fine.

00:22:39.212 --> 00:22:40.088
Geez.

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:45.051
Geez. This is…

00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:50.307
Just stay home, damn it!

00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:51.725
For Christ's sake!

00:22:51.808 --> 00:22:53.268
Geez, that guy…

00:22:54.519 --> 00:22:56.479
Someone write down his plate number.

00:22:58.190 --> 00:22:59.191
Let's go.

00:22:59.274 --> 00:23:00.275
Goodness.

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:07.866
Thanks.

00:23:08.575 --> 00:23:10.911
Push harder. The bus… Geez.

00:23:13.622 --> 00:23:15.790
Sorry. Coming through.

00:23:16.458 --> 00:23:17.667
I'm sorry.

00:23:20.003 --> 00:23:21.838
We don't have time for this!

00:23:21.922 --> 00:23:23.089
Sorry. Excuse us.

00:23:23.673 --> 00:23:25.258
I'm sorry.

00:23:29.638 --> 00:23:30.931
This isn't too bad.

00:23:31.014 --> 00:23:32.599
-Sorry?
-It's all right, isn't it?

00:23:32.682 --> 00:23:33.934
Yes. It's so convenient.

00:23:34.017 --> 00:23:35.060
Right?

00:23:36.144 --> 00:23:37.437
It's a bit hot though.

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:38.730
-Here.
-Thanks.

00:23:48.698 --> 00:23:49.908
Wait a second.

00:23:50.617 --> 00:23:51.493
Let's…

00:23:51.576 --> 00:23:54.204
-Let's stop by a restroom.
-I was going to say the same.

00:23:54.287 --> 00:23:56.248
I drank too much water.
Where's the nearest one?

00:23:56.873 --> 00:23:58.250
-Let's go that way.
-Yeah.

00:23:58.333 --> 00:24:00.377
-I think it's here. Let's go.
-Geez.

00:24:09.886 --> 00:24:11.763
For goodness' sake.

00:24:11.846 --> 00:24:14.266
-No.
-Don't.

00:24:14.349 --> 00:24:16.017
Can you help…

00:24:16.101 --> 00:24:17.560
Can you push…

00:24:19.312 --> 00:24:23.566
A wheelchair can't climb up
a curb this high.

00:24:26.319 --> 00:24:27.821
Okay, I get it.

00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:30.031
For crying out loud.

00:24:30.657 --> 00:24:31.658
Geez!

00:24:33.743 --> 00:24:35.245
For crying out loud.

00:24:35.328 --> 00:24:37.414
Untie me, will you?

00:24:37.497 --> 00:24:38.331
I can't, sir.

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:41.001
Gang-hun can't untie his for life.

00:24:41.084 --> 00:24:42.252
Jesus Christ.

00:24:46.423 --> 00:24:48.216
Geez.

00:24:49.426 --> 00:24:51.803
Just untie me. I really need to go!

00:25:02.856 --> 00:25:03.773
Okay.

00:25:06.443 --> 00:25:07.444
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

00:25:07.527 --> 00:25:11.156
Just hurry up.

00:25:11.865 --> 00:25:14.075
Hurry, hurry.

00:25:14.617 --> 00:25:15.702
What?

00:25:15.785 --> 00:25:18.121
-Geez.
-Come on.

00:25:29.049 --> 00:25:30.050
You do it.

00:25:40.352 --> 00:25:41.353
It's okay.

00:25:50.278 --> 00:25:52.447
We apologize for the trouble, Your Honor.

00:25:54.074 --> 00:25:55.408
No, it's okay.

00:25:56.409 --> 00:25:57.786
With all due respect,

00:25:57.869 --> 00:26:01.873
you traveled less than two kilometers
to arrive at court.

00:26:02.415 --> 00:26:05.960
You've only experienced
a tiny glimpse into Gang-hun's life.

00:26:06.044 --> 00:26:09.130
That was only two kilometers?

00:26:09.756 --> 00:26:10.882
Yes, Your Honor.

00:26:11.466 --> 00:26:14.177
For your information,
Gang-hun went back and forth

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:17.347
between Bucheon and my firm every day
to ask me to take his case.

00:26:18.181 --> 00:26:19.307
Every day?

00:26:19.391 --> 00:26:23.395
It's because I'm good
at dealing with my disability.

00:26:35.073 --> 00:26:35.949
Your Honor.

00:26:36.908 --> 00:26:38.910
Yes, Defense Counsel. You may speak.

00:26:38.993 --> 00:26:41.413
The defense would like to
request evidence.

00:26:42.038 --> 00:26:43.164
What is it?

00:26:44.290 --> 00:26:46.334
We request a direct examination

00:26:47.085 --> 00:26:48.837
of the plaintiff's legal guardian,

00:26:50.088 --> 00:26:52.257
Jung So-min.

00:27:15.071 --> 00:27:17.490
Is it okay if Mom doesn't come?

00:27:20.285 --> 00:27:21.119
Oh, no.

00:27:21.202 --> 00:27:22.996
It'll be hard to refuse.

00:27:23.913 --> 00:27:25.707
Why did it have to be on that day?

00:27:26.291 --> 00:27:27.292
What?

00:27:28.334 --> 00:27:30.920
Why? What day is it?

00:27:32.714 --> 00:27:33.548
It's nothing.

00:27:37.927 --> 00:27:39.554
WITNESS JUNG SO-MIN

00:27:39.637 --> 00:27:42.807
Defense Counsel, you may begin
the examination of the witness.

00:27:45.018 --> 00:27:47.770
Are you the mother of the plaintiff,
Kim Gang-hun?

00:27:49.856 --> 00:27:50.690
Yes.

00:27:50.773 --> 00:27:52.650
I'm sorry,
but where is the child's father?

00:27:52.734 --> 00:27:55.236
Objection, Your Honor. That's irrelevant.

00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:58.656
Didn't you argue the issue at hand
was the plaintiff's life itself?

00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:01.784
How can a child's parents
be irrelevant to his life?

00:28:03.369 --> 00:28:06.289
Yes. Ms. Jung, please answer the question.

00:28:09.584 --> 00:28:12.128
I've lost contact with him now.

00:28:12.212 --> 00:28:14.797
You got pregnant when you lived
with other runaway teenagers.

00:28:14.881 --> 00:28:16.508
I'm sorry,

00:28:16.591 --> 00:28:18.801
but do you even remember
who the father is?

00:28:18.885 --> 00:28:23.014
Your Honor, the defense counsel
is going beyond the scope of examination.

00:28:23.097 --> 00:28:25.934
Okay. I will retract the question.

00:28:26.684 --> 00:28:29.896
Ms. Jung, I'm sorry,

00:28:31.314 --> 00:28:33.900
but you have a lot of stuff
on your neck and arms.

00:28:33.983 --> 00:28:36.861
Are those all tattoos?

00:28:36.945 --> 00:28:40.782
-Your Honor!
-The character of the plaintiff's mother

00:28:40.865 --> 00:28:43.868
is relevant to the plaintiff's life,
Your Honor.

00:28:44.953 --> 00:28:47.038
Yes, considering
the unique aspects of this case,

00:28:47.121 --> 00:28:48.665
the Court will allow

00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:51.835
comprehensive questions
about his home environment.

00:28:51.918 --> 00:28:52.961
You may proceed.

00:28:56.172 --> 00:28:59.008
I got these tattoos
when I was young and immature.

00:28:59.092 --> 00:29:01.719
-But I couldn't erase them.
-I see.

00:29:02.387 --> 00:29:05.473
It must have been hard
to find a proper job too.

00:29:06.224 --> 00:29:07.934
Aren't you also taking antidepressants?

00:29:11.354 --> 00:29:13.857
Well, it's not that serious.

00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:15.733
Yes, so you're taking them.

00:29:17.151 --> 00:29:22.448
You know the first trial's presiding judge
was visually impaired, don't you?

00:29:22.532 --> 00:29:26.619
Her mother worked as a teacher

00:29:26.703 --> 00:29:30.623
and raised her blind daughter
to become a great judge.

00:29:31.875 --> 00:29:35.461
The life of a person
with disabilities is tough.

00:29:37.046 --> 00:29:38.673
I assume it is.

00:29:39.757 --> 00:29:42.927
How could I dare to understand
how painful it could be?

00:29:43.011 --> 00:29:43.845
However,

00:29:44.345 --> 00:29:46.639
there are many families in Korea

00:29:46.723 --> 00:29:50.727
who take care of their disabled children
with love and lead happy lives.

00:29:52.604 --> 00:29:53.646
On the other hand,

00:29:54.355 --> 00:29:56.399
your son Gang-hun,

00:29:56.482 --> 00:29:58.818
who's only 12 years old,

00:29:58.902 --> 00:30:03.239
said not being born would've been better
and filed this suit.

00:30:03.323 --> 00:30:04.824
There's something I want to know.

00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:10.121
If Gang-hun's life is like hell,

00:30:10.204 --> 00:30:12.206
is it only because of his disability?

00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:15.168
Or it is because of you
since you didn't take care of him right?

00:30:15.251 --> 00:30:16.419
Your Honor!

00:30:16.502 --> 00:30:19.088
-You may continue.
-If Gang-hun's life is damaging,

00:30:19.172 --> 00:30:20.757
then who caused that damage?

00:30:21.716 --> 00:30:24.385
Is the hospital to blame
for not allowing an abortion?

00:30:24.469 --> 00:30:27.430
Or is it you and the unruly,
irresponsible life you've led?

00:30:27.513 --> 00:30:30.141
-Your Honor!
-That's enough, Counsel.

00:30:31.017 --> 00:30:32.977
Abusive questioning is not permitted.

00:30:33.519 --> 00:30:36.814
Yes, Your Honor.
I'll ask one last question then.

00:30:39.025 --> 00:30:40.109
Ms. Jung.

00:30:40.193 --> 00:30:43.988
Do you believe giving birth
to Gang-hun was damaging?

00:30:46.157 --> 00:30:46.991
What?

00:30:50.453 --> 00:30:51.496
There.

00:30:52.622 --> 00:30:54.082
Look at your son.

00:30:55.625 --> 00:30:59.337
Have you been living your entire life
hating and regretting the fact

00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:02.882
that you gave birth to him?

00:31:20.817 --> 00:31:22.986
No.

00:31:23.569 --> 00:31:24.779
I don't.

00:31:26.447 --> 00:31:27.323
Never.

00:31:28.241 --> 00:31:31.244
I've never thought that.

00:31:32.036 --> 00:31:34.914
I can't live without him!

00:31:39.085 --> 00:31:40.128
Is that so?

00:31:41.129 --> 00:31:43.798
Why did you agree to this lawsuit then?

00:31:44.716 --> 00:31:45.800
What?

00:31:45.883 --> 00:31:49.220
A minor can't sue
without their legal guardian's consent.

00:31:49.303 --> 00:31:53.683
This trial is happening
because you agreed to file the suit.

00:31:53.766 --> 00:31:55.476
Did you agree to it

00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:58.229
because you thought it'd be better

00:31:58.312 --> 00:32:00.440
-if Gang-hun hadn't been born?
-No.

00:32:00.523 --> 00:32:01.607
No!

00:32:02.191 --> 00:32:03.860
I was just…

00:32:04.694 --> 00:32:08.573
I couldn't help it
because Gang-hun was so persistent--

00:32:08.656 --> 00:32:09.991
So persistent?

00:32:10.867 --> 00:32:13.828
You couldn't help it
because a child was persistent?

00:32:14.412 --> 00:32:15.371
Ms. Jung.

00:32:16.247 --> 00:32:17.790
My apologies.

00:32:18.875 --> 00:32:20.543
I'm sorry,

00:32:20.626 --> 00:32:22.045
but is it for the money?

00:32:22.128 --> 00:32:24.005
-Your Honor!
-It isn't, is it?

00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:25.631
No way.

00:32:26.716 --> 00:32:27.717
A mother?

00:32:28.843 --> 00:32:30.219
She'd use her young child,

00:32:30.303 --> 00:32:34.432
with a disability at that,
as a pawn just for money?

00:32:34.515 --> 00:32:36.601
That question was also abusive,
Your Honor!

00:32:37.602 --> 00:32:39.520
I sincerely hope that's not true,

00:32:39.604 --> 00:32:42.190
and I will also retract that question.

00:32:43.357 --> 00:32:44.442
No further questions.

00:33:28.778 --> 00:33:31.781
If Gang-hun's life is like hell,

00:33:31.864 --> 00:33:34.158
is it only because of his disability?

00:33:34.242 --> 00:33:37.578
Or it is because of you
since you didn't take care of him right?

00:33:50.925 --> 00:33:51.968
Do you want that?

00:33:52.051 --> 00:33:54.011
No, it's expensive.

00:33:54.095 --> 00:33:55.930
-It's all right.
-Here.

00:33:57.849 --> 00:33:59.100
Could you wrap this up for us?

00:33:59.183 --> 00:34:00.685
-All right.
-Mom!

00:34:00.768 --> 00:34:01.727
It's okay, So-min.

00:34:01.811 --> 00:34:04.605
Let's do everything you want today.

00:34:04.689 --> 00:34:07.066
Really? That's strange.

00:34:07.150 --> 00:34:08.651
It's not even my birthday today.

00:34:11.571 --> 00:34:13.197
Every day is your birthday.

00:34:13.281 --> 00:34:15.867
-Should we go ride the merry-go-round too?
-Yeah!

00:34:24.917 --> 00:34:26.252
-Are you having fun?
-Yeah!

00:34:38.556 --> 00:34:39.849
Mom.

00:34:40.433 --> 00:34:41.350
Yes?

00:34:41.434 --> 00:34:45.229
Today was the happiest day of my life.

00:34:46.314 --> 00:34:48.566
You liked the theme park that much?

00:34:48.649 --> 00:34:49.650
No.

00:34:50.401 --> 00:34:52.236
It's because you smiled all day.

00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:12.882
Mom, where are we? Why are we here?

00:35:15.509 --> 00:35:16.886
So-min, it's just for a month.

00:35:16.969 --> 00:35:19.096
Just wait one month for me here.

00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:22.642
I'll be overseas just for a bit
to make some money.

00:35:23.684 --> 00:35:26.646
I promise I'll come back for you. Okay?

00:35:26.729 --> 00:35:28.564
Mom, no!

00:35:28.648 --> 00:35:30.358
Take me with you!

00:35:30.942 --> 00:35:32.777
Mom!

00:35:33.736 --> 00:35:37.406
-Mom, please take me with you!
-I promise I'll come back for you.

00:35:37.490 --> 00:35:39.033
Mom, let me go with you!

00:35:39.116 --> 00:35:40.785
Mom!

00:35:41.744 --> 00:35:43.913
Mom!

00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:46.916
Mom!

00:35:49.335 --> 00:35:51.712
Mom!

00:36:52.398 --> 00:36:53.482
Mom…

00:37:05.661 --> 00:37:06.746
Mom.

00:38:24.949 --> 00:38:28.494
TALK TO THE PERSON WHO LOVES SO-MIN
MORE THAN ANYONE IN THE WORLD

00:38:42.466 --> 00:38:43.467
Mom?

00:38:44.635 --> 00:38:45.678
Mom!

00:38:48.431 --> 00:38:49.432
Gang-hun.

00:38:50.474 --> 00:38:51.434
Gang-hun!

00:38:51.976 --> 00:38:53.602
Is that you, Gang-hun?

00:38:53.686 --> 00:38:54.937
How did you…

00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:57.690
Mom, don't do it.
I can't live without you.

00:39:00.609 --> 00:39:03.028
Gang-hun.

00:39:05.823 --> 00:39:06.866
I'm sorry, Mom.

00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:10.161
All you do is work every day
because of me.

00:39:11.579 --> 00:39:14.748
Because of me, you're in pain
physically and mentally.

00:39:17.418 --> 00:39:18.502
I'm sorry, Mom.

00:39:19.295 --> 00:39:20.546
Honestly, I…

00:39:22.173 --> 00:39:24.842
I thought you'd be happy
if I wasn't around,

00:39:24.925 --> 00:39:26.469
so that's why I looked into adoption.

00:39:29.138 --> 00:39:31.557
You're young and pretty.

00:39:32.516 --> 00:39:34.310
If it weren't for me…

00:39:35.311 --> 00:39:37.229
If only I didn't exist…

00:39:43.194 --> 00:39:45.696
Some people did contact me.

00:39:47.031 --> 00:39:49.450
They seemed like good people.

00:39:55.122 --> 00:39:56.665
Mom!

00:40:02.796 --> 00:40:05.049
Gang-hun!

00:40:13.557 --> 00:40:16.769
How did you get here?

00:40:16.852 --> 00:40:17.895
I'm sorry, Mom.

00:40:19.063 --> 00:40:22.191
I can't live without you.

00:40:25.903 --> 00:40:27.655
I love you, Mom.

00:40:30.115 --> 00:40:31.951
I love you too.

00:40:32.034 --> 00:40:33.160
I love you.

00:40:33.244 --> 00:40:36.247
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

00:40:37.831 --> 00:40:39.875
I'll never do it again.

00:40:39.959 --> 00:40:41.669
I'm sorry.

00:40:41.752 --> 00:40:44.129
I love you too.

00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:48.717
I'm sorry. I'll never do that again.

00:40:49.426 --> 00:40:50.719
You must've been so scared.

00:40:51.262 --> 00:40:54.056
-I'm sorry.
-Mom.

00:40:59.812 --> 00:41:02.648
I'll never leave you alone again.

00:41:02.731 --> 00:41:05.150
Why? What day is it?

00:41:06.235 --> 00:41:07.111
Tell us.

00:41:09.863 --> 00:41:11.699
The day after the hearing

00:41:13.117 --> 00:41:15.119
is the day when she was abandoned.

00:41:16.370 --> 00:41:20.791
Mom has a really hard time
all day that day.

00:41:21.375 --> 00:41:24.169
But if she has to go to court,
I wonder if she'll be okay.

00:41:26.255 --> 00:41:27.840
My mom is a scaredy-cat.

00:41:28.465 --> 00:41:29.383
She's like a baby.

00:41:29.466 --> 00:41:31.760
I'm so sorry.

00:41:32.761 --> 00:41:36.056
But she can't date anyone
or get married because of me.

00:41:36.682 --> 00:41:42.104
Her arms and back hurt
from carrying me around her whole life.

00:41:42.813 --> 00:41:43.647
I'm sorry.

00:42:00.956 --> 00:42:04.752
Due to the defense counsel's deliberate
repeating of abusive questioning,

00:42:04.835 --> 00:42:07.379
we request an apology
and assurance that it won't happen again.

00:42:09.173 --> 00:42:11.508
A trial isn't for giving each other
well wishes.

00:42:12.926 --> 00:42:15.721
Sometimes, we have to touch
on painful subjects

00:42:15.804 --> 00:42:17.431
to reveal the truth.

00:42:17.514 --> 00:42:20.225
-Plaintiff's Counsel knows that as well.
-Your Honor.

00:42:20.934 --> 00:42:23.937
The plaintiff would like to request
a witness as well.

00:42:24.772 --> 00:42:25.773
Who is it?

00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:29.735
It's the key figure behind this case.

00:42:31.945 --> 00:42:35.240
We'd like to call
Woongsan Group CEO Choi Woong-san

00:42:35.324 --> 00:42:38.535
as a witness to this appeal trial.

00:42:39.828 --> 00:42:41.330
Your Honey… Your Honor!

00:42:41.872 --> 00:42:44.667
This is a malicious attempt
to delay the trial.

00:42:45.292 --> 00:42:47.753
All right, Defense Counsel.
Please sit down and talk.

00:42:47.836 --> 00:42:50.381
I mean, why would we call
an irrelevant CEO to this trial?

00:42:50.464 --> 00:42:52.966
Please sit and talk, Defense Counsel.
Order in the court.

00:42:53.550 --> 00:42:54.510
Please sit.

00:42:56.929 --> 00:42:58.847
"Your Honey… Your Honor!"

00:42:59.431 --> 00:43:02.476
That look on Mr. Woo's face was a delight.

00:43:02.559 --> 00:43:05.938
Because chaebols pay him all that money
to make sure such things don't happen.

00:43:06.021 --> 00:43:09.650
Will he really come to the court though?
I think he'll do all he can to avoid it.

00:43:10.693 --> 00:43:13.904
Choi Woong-san
has always been like a hermit.

00:43:13.987 --> 00:43:16.073
He hasn't been seen in public
for a while now.

00:43:16.615 --> 00:43:18.367
He barely goes out too.

00:43:18.450 --> 00:43:20.285
Really? But how do you know that?

00:43:20.369 --> 00:43:22.287
It's well-known among chaebol circles.

00:43:24.081 --> 00:43:24.915
Is that so?

00:43:24.998 --> 00:43:27.209
And how do you know that?

00:43:30.254 --> 00:43:31.296
Welcome back.

00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:34.675
Gi-ppeum, where have you been?
You were gone all morning.

00:43:35.342 --> 00:43:36.635
I was busy.

00:43:36.719 --> 00:43:40.514
I went to hospitals,
child welfare groups, and psychiatrists.

00:43:40.597 --> 00:43:42.766
To help So-min? That's my Gi-ppeum.

00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:45.811
But more importantly,

00:43:46.895 --> 00:43:49.940
I wanted to see
if So-min is in the right situation

00:43:50.023 --> 00:43:51.150
to take care of Gang-hun.

00:43:51.233 --> 00:43:52.067
I see.

00:43:53.026 --> 00:43:54.194
Mr. Kang,

00:43:54.278 --> 00:43:56.363
I don't think we should
drag this out too long.

00:43:56.447 --> 00:43:59.908
So-min and Gang-hun
are more important than winning or losing.

00:44:01.034 --> 00:44:02.703
Even if we did want to drag this out,

00:44:04.538 --> 00:44:07.040
-we probably can't.
-What?

00:44:08.667 --> 00:44:10.461
I told you not to cross the line.

00:44:12.963 --> 00:44:14.089
Think wisely.

00:44:14.715 --> 00:44:16.800
If anyone causes harm to Oh & Partners,

00:44:17.676 --> 00:44:19.178
I won't keep them around.

00:44:20.179 --> 00:44:21.430
That goes for Team Pro Bono…

00:44:22.681 --> 00:44:23.849
and you…

00:44:26.477 --> 00:44:27.478
as well.

00:44:32.858 --> 00:44:34.109
PRACTICAL STRATEGIES FOR GO

00:44:36.653 --> 00:44:40.532
I apologize for causing you trouble,
Mr. Chairman.

00:44:41.116 --> 00:44:45.496
I'll take responsibility and make sure
you won't have to stand trial.

00:44:46.121 --> 00:44:49.666
I'll submit a letter of absence
with a doctor's note to the court…

00:44:51.251 --> 00:44:52.669
I'll go.

00:44:53.545 --> 00:44:54.421
Sir?

00:44:55.130 --> 00:44:56.131
Mr. Chairman.

00:45:17.236 --> 00:45:18.487
What are you looking at?

00:45:42.511 --> 00:45:44.221
I'll get the chair for you.

00:45:45.430 --> 00:45:48.976
Defense Counsel, that's enough.

00:45:52.062 --> 00:45:54.022
-Witness Choi Woong-san.
-Yes, Your Honor.

00:45:54.606 --> 00:45:55.649
Please take your oath.

00:45:57.901 --> 00:45:58.735
"Witness oath."

00:46:00.028 --> 00:46:02.447
"I swear to speak the truth

00:46:02.531 --> 00:46:04.658
and nothing but the truth
according to my conscience."

00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:06.994
"If there is any falsehood,

00:46:07.578 --> 00:46:09.913
I shall be punished for perjury."

00:46:10.622 --> 00:46:12.708
"Choi Woong-san." Do I sign this?

00:46:12.791 --> 00:46:14.501
Yes, please sign it and take a seat.

00:46:16.753 --> 00:46:18.839
-Plaintiff's Counsel.
-Yes, Your Honor?

00:46:18.922 --> 00:46:20.882
Start your examination.

00:46:26.096 --> 00:46:28.682
Thank you for coming, Mr. Choi Woong-san.

00:46:29.891 --> 00:46:31.768
You don't have to thank me.

00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:35.272
Isn't it compulsory
to appear as a witness?

00:46:35.939 --> 00:46:37.190
Of course, it is.

00:46:37.816 --> 00:46:39.026
It was just a greeting.

00:46:39.735 --> 00:46:41.862
Then, I'll proceed.
Mr. Choi, are you a god?

00:46:42.863 --> 00:46:45.782
What kind of ridiculous question is that?

00:46:45.866 --> 00:46:48.118
I'm just checking the facts.

00:46:49.244 --> 00:46:52.831
By any chance,
are you a god, Mr. Choi?

00:46:52.914 --> 00:46:56.084
I don't know what your intention is,
but of course not.

00:46:56.918 --> 00:46:57.919
Okay.

00:46:58.754 --> 00:47:00.213
You're not a god.

00:47:00.881 --> 00:47:03.133
"No god." Then…

00:47:03.216 --> 00:47:05.510
Do you have some kind of right

00:47:05.594 --> 00:47:07.971
to be involved
in the lives and deaths of others?

00:47:11.308 --> 00:47:13.977
I think your joke
is going a bit too far, Mr. Kang.

00:47:14.895 --> 00:47:17.314
I'd never joke in this hallowed court.

00:47:17.397 --> 00:47:18.732
Please answer the question.

00:47:22.319 --> 00:47:23.654
How can a mere human being

00:47:24.821 --> 00:47:26.281
hold such a right?

00:47:26.365 --> 00:47:27.240
I don't.

00:47:27.824 --> 00:47:30.577
All right. You don't have the right.

00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:35.165
Then, on what authority did you
meddle in the life and death of others?

00:47:35.248 --> 00:47:36.625
Your Honor.

00:47:40.962 --> 00:47:43.840
What makes you say such a thing?

00:47:44.716 --> 00:47:48.804
Did you know
Woongsan General Hospital's abortion rate

00:47:48.887 --> 00:47:52.349
is far lower than the rates
of other hospitals?

00:47:52.974 --> 00:47:53.809
I didn't.

00:47:53.892 --> 00:47:55.686
Woongsan Welfare Foundation

00:47:55.769 --> 00:48:01.400
sends pregnant runaway teenagers,
the group with the highest abortion rate,

00:48:01.483 --> 00:48:04.236
to Woongsan General Hospital
and persuades them to give birth.

00:48:04.319 --> 00:48:05.237
Did you know that?

00:48:05.862 --> 00:48:08.657
I didn't, but if that's the case,
it's not persuading.

00:48:09.783 --> 00:48:10.951
It would be support.

00:48:11.993 --> 00:48:16.498
Jung So-min, the mother
of the plaintiff Kim Gang-hun,

00:48:16.581 --> 00:48:18.834
stated multiple times
in the early stages of pregnancy

00:48:19.459 --> 00:48:21.962
that she wanted an abortion.

00:48:22.045 --> 00:48:26.299
But the medical staff exaggerated
the dangers of the procedure

00:48:26.925 --> 00:48:31.680
and failed to diagnose and explain
the possibility of the baby's disability.

00:48:31.763 --> 00:48:32.848
Did you know that?

00:48:33.974 --> 00:48:36.601
It's impossible for me
to know all those details.

00:48:37.352 --> 00:48:39.855
Also, let's say that was the case.

00:48:41.815 --> 00:48:43.734
Why am I being held accountable?

00:48:44.484 --> 00:48:48.697
I've never ordered anyone
to do such a thing.

00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:51.575
Who picked a doctor
from a regional national hospital

00:48:51.658 --> 00:48:53.994
and appointed him
as Woongsan General Hospital's head?

00:48:54.077 --> 00:48:54.995
That was me.

00:48:55.078 --> 00:48:59.332
Do you know what the former workplace
of the Foundation's secretary general is?

00:48:59.416 --> 00:49:01.793
Just say it instead of asking me
when you already know.

00:49:02.377 --> 00:49:04.713
You're the one who has to answer.
Please go ahead.

00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:06.423
That's right.

00:49:10.719 --> 00:49:15.599
He was my former secretary.
But I have never given such an order.

00:49:15.682 --> 00:49:19.311
Do they also know
about your anti-abortion beliefs?

00:49:19.394 --> 00:49:20.854
You can ask them about that.

00:49:20.937 --> 00:49:23.482
Okay. Let me change the question then.

00:49:23.565 --> 00:49:26.443
This data shows
the anti-abortion groups you support

00:49:26.526 --> 00:49:28.779
with massive donations
through the Elliot Foundation.

00:49:28.862 --> 00:49:30.655
Both Woongsan General Hospital's head

00:49:30.739 --> 00:49:33.617
and Woongsan Welfare Foundation's
secretary general

00:49:34.367 --> 00:49:39.039
suddenly started making personal donations
to these groups after they were appointed.

00:49:39.122 --> 00:49:40.332
You knew this, didn't you?

00:49:41.291 --> 00:49:42.292
Okay.

00:49:43.627 --> 00:49:45.295
Good.

00:49:49.257 --> 00:49:50.926
Do you want some water?

00:49:51.009 --> 00:49:52.344
I have my own.

00:49:53.428 --> 00:49:54.304
Please go ahead.

00:49:55.972 --> 00:50:00.185
I think I see the point
of what you're saying now.

00:50:00.268 --> 00:50:01.937
"Even if I never gave a direct order,

00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:05.398
everything that happens within the purview
of Woongsan is my responsibility."

00:50:05.482 --> 00:50:07.234
Is that what you're saying?

00:50:09.986 --> 00:50:10.904
Do you admit it?

00:50:10.987 --> 00:50:12.489
-Yes, I do.
-Mr. Choi.

00:50:14.825 --> 00:50:17.202
Let me ask a question too.

00:50:18.411 --> 00:50:21.331
But what am I responsible for?

00:50:24.417 --> 00:50:25.252
I mean…

00:50:26.878 --> 00:50:29.840
Don't you see a boy in pain right here?

00:50:30.882 --> 00:50:33.635
I only see a smart, capable,

00:50:33.718 --> 00:50:35.846
and very handsome boy.

00:50:37.138 --> 00:50:38.139
Well…

00:50:39.266 --> 00:50:40.976
"Every life is beautiful."

00:50:41.059 --> 00:50:44.062
"How could a life be damaging."
You're not going to say that, are you?

00:50:44.729 --> 00:50:45.730
Is that not true?

00:50:51.403 --> 00:50:52.946
Is there a life without pain?

00:50:53.029 --> 00:50:57.033
But instead of blaming the world
and complaining,

00:50:57.117 --> 00:51:00.412
you have a duty to fight and overcome

00:51:01.204 --> 00:51:03.540
as you move forward one step at a time.

00:51:04.124 --> 00:51:07.294
That's what I've believed
and how I've lived my life.

00:51:08.378 --> 00:51:09.212
Complaining?

00:51:10.463 --> 00:51:12.549
Do you think of this trial as complaining?

00:51:12.632 --> 00:51:15.385
You may see it that way as someone
who established Woongsan Group

00:51:15.468 --> 00:51:18.889
after being born into a wealthy family
that has been landowners for generations.

00:51:20.724 --> 00:51:21.933
But you know what?

00:51:22.017 --> 00:51:25.020
There are people who always lose.

00:51:25.103 --> 00:51:28.398
No matter how hard they try,
they're too weak to fight the world.

00:51:28.940 --> 00:51:30.317
Did you know

00:51:31.067 --> 00:51:33.695
a mother had to leave
her precious young daughter

00:51:33.778 --> 00:51:36.990
in front of an orphanage
because she was being crushed by debt?

00:51:37.073 --> 00:51:38.658
Did you know

00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:42.495
a 12-year-old child looked
for a way to be adopted,

00:51:42.579 --> 00:51:46.541
thinking his absence would be
the only way for his mother to be happy?

00:51:47.417 --> 00:51:51.046
Did it ever cross your mind
that there is a mother

00:51:51.129 --> 00:51:53.632
who had her hand cut off
while working at the factory

00:51:53.715 --> 00:51:56.968
but kept the pain to herself
to not disturb her child's studies?

00:52:00.472 --> 00:52:02.390
No matter what pain
and hardship you may face,

00:52:02.474 --> 00:52:05.644
this world is worth living in
is what I believe.

00:52:05.727 --> 00:52:07.729
I've lived my life according to my belief.

00:52:09.314 --> 00:52:12.484
And I don't intend to apologize to anyone

00:52:14.444 --> 00:52:15.779
for my belief.

00:52:24.412 --> 00:52:27.290
All right. We'll conclude
the morning session here.

00:52:27.874 --> 00:52:30.585
We will resume at 2:00 p.m.

00:52:35.131 --> 00:52:36.841
All rise.

00:52:48.061 --> 00:52:50.480
Why aren't you eating?
You must be exhausted.

00:52:52.732 --> 00:52:54.192
I don't have an appetite these days.

00:53:00.949 --> 00:53:02.242
Excuse me. Sorry.

00:53:04.244 --> 00:53:05.161
All right.

00:53:05.745 --> 00:53:07.372
-Hey.
-Hello.

00:53:07.455 --> 00:53:11.251
Remember how you asked me to keep tabs
on Ms. Yoon and find out who she meets?

00:53:11.793 --> 00:53:12.836
Right.

00:53:14.087 --> 00:53:15.171
It was someone unexpected.

00:53:15.797 --> 00:53:16.673
Who is it?

00:53:17.215 --> 00:53:18.049
Damn it.

00:53:18.133 --> 00:53:21.511
The chief of Seoul Central District Court,
your former workplace.

00:53:23.263 --> 00:53:24.305
What?

00:53:24.389 --> 00:53:27.100
They're meeting at a Japanese restaurant
far away from the court,

00:53:27.183 --> 00:53:30.061
so I thought they were having an affair
and eavesdropped.

00:53:30.854 --> 00:53:32.272
I couldn't hear well, but it went,

00:53:32.981 --> 00:53:34.399
"Why do this on such a big day?"

00:53:34.482 --> 00:53:37.360
"Give me the money you promised.
I did as you asked."

00:53:38.028 --> 00:53:39.654
That's all I could make out.

00:53:45.744 --> 00:53:47.203
Okay, then.

00:53:47.287 --> 00:53:48.830
-I'll call you back later.
-Okay.

00:53:52.959 --> 00:53:54.502
Sorry.

00:53:54.586 --> 00:53:55.628
Is there a problem?

00:53:55.712 --> 00:53:57.297
-No. It's nothing.
-A new wind

00:53:57.380 --> 00:53:59.132
is blowing through the judiciary.

00:53:59.215 --> 00:54:00.467
Today, the Chief Justice

00:54:00.550 --> 00:54:02.218
recommended Shin Jung-seok,

00:54:02.302 --> 00:54:05.972
Chief of Seoul Central District Court,
to the president as a new justice.

00:54:06.473 --> 00:54:07.849
After Chief Judge Kang Da-wit,

00:54:07.932 --> 00:54:11.561
who caused a sensation
as the people's judge, suddenly resigned,

00:54:12.103 --> 00:54:14.314
a fierce contest was held
between three court chiefs.

00:54:14.898 --> 00:54:18.234
In the end, Chief Shin, who is trusted
within and outside legal circles,

00:54:18.318 --> 00:54:21.112
has been confirmed
as a new chief justice candidate.

00:54:22.322 --> 00:54:24.866
I trusted and guided you

00:54:24.949 --> 00:54:27.786
when you were a nobody
without a college degree.

00:54:27.869 --> 00:54:30.330
How could you betray me like this,
you snake?

00:54:31.915 --> 00:54:33.500
Chief Shin was selected.

00:54:34.501 --> 00:54:37.962
I met him once in court before.

00:54:38.046 --> 00:54:40.256
He was really nice to new attorneys.

00:54:41.049 --> 00:54:42.550
He seemed like a good person.

00:54:44.511 --> 00:54:46.096
-Did he?
-Yes.

00:54:49.224 --> 00:54:51.893
And about the witness examination…

00:54:51.976 --> 00:54:54.354
-Yes?
-In my opinion,

00:54:54.437 --> 00:54:57.941
Chairman Choi may look like
a very stubborn person,

00:54:58.024 --> 00:54:59.818
but he surprisingly had a human side.

00:55:00.819 --> 00:55:03.363
Instead of pressing him really hard,

00:55:03.446 --> 00:55:06.282
how about we approach
his human side in the afternoon?

00:55:10.036 --> 00:55:13.832
Do you believe there are more good people
than bad ones in the world?

00:55:14.457 --> 00:55:15.291
What?

00:55:15.375 --> 00:55:18.044
When it comes to their own interests,

00:55:18.128 --> 00:55:20.338
people don't care
about the pain of others.

00:55:21.256 --> 00:55:22.340
You should know well.

00:55:22.423 --> 00:55:24.968
After being scammed by his friend,
your father lost the house

00:55:25.051 --> 00:55:26.177
and was harassed by debtors.

00:55:26.261 --> 00:55:28.596
After going through all of that,

00:55:29.639 --> 00:55:32.767
do you still believe
there are more good people in the world?

00:55:35.019 --> 00:55:37.230
There are all sorts of people.

00:55:37.814 --> 00:55:39.524
I mean, how could everyone be bad?

00:55:40.692 --> 00:55:42.443
You really are hopeless.

00:55:43.027 --> 00:55:46.489
Then, what are you going to do
if there are no more good people?

00:55:48.700 --> 00:55:50.827
In that case…

00:55:55.123 --> 00:55:55.957
I…

00:55:57.584 --> 00:55:59.043
can become the good person.

00:55:59.127 --> 00:56:00.044
What?

00:56:05.508 --> 00:56:06.759
Eat up.

00:56:09.304 --> 00:56:13.600
Mr. Choi, you've recently donated
10 billion won to Big Love Church,

00:56:13.683 --> 00:56:15.602
where you serve as an elder,

00:56:15.685 --> 00:56:18.146
to lead the spirit of sharing. Correct?

00:56:19.564 --> 00:56:22.233
"Lead" would be a bit too much,

00:56:23.318 --> 00:56:24.694
but I did do that.

00:56:24.777 --> 00:56:27.363
Aren't you planning to use

00:56:27.447 --> 00:56:32.035
that donation to the church to fund
the construction of a fancy new chapel?

00:56:32.118 --> 00:56:33.745
I don't know if it'll be fancy.

00:56:34.537 --> 00:56:36.706
But it was indeed a donation
for chapel construction.

00:56:36.789 --> 00:56:38.583
Woongsan Welfare Foundation

00:56:38.666 --> 00:56:40.877
has been supporting
underprivileged children

00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:44.547
to give them a chance
to get the best education.

00:56:44.631 --> 00:56:48.176
The plaintiff Kim Gang-hun
began receiving that benefit this year

00:56:48.259 --> 00:56:50.261
and is attending
Woongsan Elementary School.

00:56:50.345 --> 00:56:51.930
Did you know that?

00:56:52.013 --> 00:56:53.223
I've heard.

00:56:55.516 --> 00:56:56.434
I apologize,

00:56:56.517 --> 00:56:59.646
but you also have
difficulties walking, don't you?

00:57:00.563 --> 00:57:01.439
I do.

00:57:01.522 --> 00:57:04.067
But despite the disability,

00:57:04.150 --> 00:57:05.735
if you try and don't give up,

00:57:05.818 --> 00:57:08.196
you can overcome any obstacle.

00:57:08.905 --> 00:57:11.366
You're proving that
with your own life, aren't you?

00:57:12.283 --> 00:57:13.660
I've lived my life believing that.

00:57:16.371 --> 00:57:17.997
No further questions.

00:57:18.081 --> 00:57:21.876
Okay. Plaintiff, do you have
anything else for examination?

00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:23.628
Yes. Of course, Your Honor.

00:57:23.711 --> 00:57:25.129
You may proceed.

00:57:26.130 --> 00:57:27.715
-Mr. Choi.
-Your Honor!

00:57:27.799 --> 00:57:30.552
Yes? Is something the matter?

00:57:30.635 --> 00:57:32.095
Can I ask questions too?

00:57:34.347 --> 00:57:35.723
What?

00:57:36.849 --> 00:57:39.727
You want to ask questions
to the witness yourself?

00:57:41.145 --> 00:57:42.313
Yes.

00:57:45.149 --> 00:57:46.150
Okay, then.

00:57:47.235 --> 00:57:50.363
Is it okay if the plaintiff himself
can ask questions from now on?

00:57:51.739 --> 00:57:54.409
Yes, all right. You may ask, Plaintiff.

00:58:02.959 --> 00:58:03.835
Hello, sir.

00:58:06.462 --> 00:58:07.297
Hello.

00:58:08.715 --> 00:58:11.384
Thank you for sending me to a good school.

00:58:11.467 --> 00:58:12.468
Goodness.

00:58:13.261 --> 00:58:15.805
You're a polite boy. You're welcome.

00:58:15.888 --> 00:58:19.225
But since last month,
I haven't been able to go to school.

00:58:21.436 --> 00:58:23.479
Did someone bully you?

00:58:24.063 --> 00:58:25.023
No.

00:58:25.732 --> 00:58:27.900
They were all kind people.

00:58:29.485 --> 00:58:30.486
They were…

00:58:31.279 --> 00:58:34.407
until I did something wrong.

00:58:35.950 --> 00:58:38.578
A new friend has transferred
to our school today.

00:58:38.661 --> 00:58:40.538
His name is Kim Gang-hun.

00:58:41.331 --> 00:58:44.459
As you can see, Gang-hun is very special.

00:58:45.126 --> 00:58:47.462
Will you all help him out?

00:58:47.545 --> 00:58:48.921
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

00:58:49.005 --> 00:58:50.798
Our class president and vice president.

00:58:50.882 --> 00:58:54.010
You two especially have to
take good care of him. Okay?

00:58:54.636 --> 00:58:55.762
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

00:58:55.845 --> 00:58:57.180
Nice to meet you, Gang-hun.

00:58:59.223 --> 00:59:00.725
Nice to meet you, Se-ryeong.

00:59:02.185 --> 00:59:03.561
My hand is clean.

00:59:03.645 --> 00:59:06.522
Let's write down "My Future Goals."

00:59:06.606 --> 00:59:07.523
Sorry.

00:59:09.025 --> 00:59:10.443
Write it neatly.

00:59:40.515 --> 00:59:41.516
Se-ryeong.

00:59:41.599 --> 00:59:43.226
Yes? What is it, Gang-hun?

00:59:43.309 --> 00:59:44.185
Here.

00:59:45.603 --> 00:59:46.896
What's this?

00:59:48.356 --> 00:59:49.649
Right.

00:59:50.233 --> 00:59:51.901
You were going to lend me this book.

00:59:51.984 --> 00:59:54.779
Thanks for the book, Gang-hun.

00:59:54.862 --> 00:59:56.406
-Sure.
-Show it!

00:59:56.489 --> 00:59:57.615
Show it to me now!

00:59:59.909 --> 01:00:00.868
Sorry, Se-ryeong.

01:00:00.952 --> 01:00:01.994
Hold on.

01:00:03.246 --> 01:00:06.249
-Give that to me.
-What is this?

01:00:07.417 --> 01:00:10.586
"Se-ryeong, I hope you like this book"!

01:00:10.670 --> 01:00:11.754
Please give it back!

01:00:11.838 --> 01:00:14.507
"And if it's okay,
will you go to the library with me?"

01:00:16.509 --> 01:00:17.635
Congrats, Se-ryeong!

01:00:17.719 --> 01:00:19.095
You have a boyfriend now?

01:00:20.388 --> 01:00:21.723
-Give it!
-You can't reach.

01:00:25.643 --> 01:00:26.811
This punk's a real man.

01:00:27.645 --> 01:00:29.439
-Date each other!
-Date each other!

01:00:30.231 --> 01:00:33.443
-Date each other!
-Date each other!

01:00:33.526 --> 01:00:35.319
-Se-ryeong, it's not…
-Date each other!

01:00:35.903 --> 01:00:40.825
-Date each other!
-Date each other!

01:00:40.908 --> 01:00:42.952
Hey! Be quiet!

01:00:45.496 --> 01:00:46.914
Hey, man. What's wrong?

01:01:02.054 --> 01:01:05.683
-Date each other!
-Date each other!

01:01:05.767 --> 01:01:07.435
Date each other!

01:01:08.227 --> 01:01:10.146
It wasn't their fault.

01:01:11.689 --> 01:01:13.983
They were all kind to me.

01:01:14.609 --> 01:01:16.194
It was my fault.

01:01:19.655 --> 01:01:24.285
I must've lost my mind for a bit
because they were nice to me.

01:01:28.039 --> 01:01:32.335
I put my teachers into trouble too.

01:01:36.464 --> 01:01:37.507
What are we going to do?

01:01:38.257 --> 01:01:40.718
Some mothers are a bit sensitive.

01:01:40.802 --> 01:01:44.347
"Why did you leave a boy alone
in the classroom during PE class?"

01:01:44.430 --> 01:01:48.059
"Some kids saw him fiddling
with clothes that girls changed out of."

01:01:48.142 --> 01:01:49.560
No.

01:01:49.644 --> 01:01:51.103
That's nonsense, ma'am.

01:01:51.187 --> 01:01:53.606
You know Gang-hun wouldn't do
something like that.

01:01:54.315 --> 01:01:57.693
Yes, I know too.

01:01:57.777 --> 01:02:00.947
But the mothers here are very sensitive.

01:02:01.614 --> 01:02:03.616
They call and text me all day.

01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:06.536
It's a headache for me too.

01:02:10.039 --> 01:02:12.291
I prefer a special education school.

01:02:13.209 --> 01:02:15.878
Even if I got a girlfriend there,

01:02:17.046 --> 01:02:19.549
no one would be surprised
or feel uncomfortable.

01:02:22.426 --> 01:02:23.678
But…

01:02:24.887 --> 01:02:28.683
to get to the closest
special education school from my house,

01:02:29.350 --> 01:02:30.935
it takes an hour and a half.

01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:33.521
Thankfully,

01:02:34.272 --> 01:02:37.024
a new one was going to be
built in our town,

01:02:37.108 --> 01:02:38.109
so I was happy.

01:02:40.486 --> 01:02:42.655
But I guess our neighbors hate the idea.

01:02:48.119 --> 01:02:49.662
I just…

01:02:51.414 --> 01:02:54.125
want to live like every other kid.

01:02:58.713 --> 01:02:59.714
Grandpa.

01:03:01.507 --> 01:03:03.718
You said if we try and don't give up,

01:03:04.719 --> 01:03:07.263
we can overcome any obstacle.

01:03:10.850 --> 01:03:11.851
But…

01:03:12.810 --> 01:03:15.021
I don't get it.

01:03:17.857 --> 01:03:21.611
All I've learned to do is to give up.

01:03:26.115 --> 01:03:29.368
That way, I wouldn't inconvenience anyone.

01:03:31.996 --> 01:03:33.372
Please tell me.

01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:37.585
What do I need to do
so I can live like other kids?

01:03:40.671 --> 01:03:41.672
Grandpa.

01:03:43.299 --> 01:03:44.926
I know you're a great person.

01:03:59.607 --> 01:04:01.734
-Your Honor.
-Yes, Mr. Choi?

01:04:04.820 --> 01:04:07.031
It's a bit exhausting
to sit for a long time.

01:04:08.532 --> 01:04:11.410
I'd appreciate it
if you could schedule another hearing.

01:04:13.204 --> 01:04:16.457
Okay. Let's do that. That's it for today.

01:04:16.540 --> 01:04:19.710
The trial will resume
on the next hearing date.

01:04:24.006 --> 01:04:26.425
All rise.

01:04:27.009 --> 01:04:30.972
Why do we need a school for the disabled
in our great neighborhood?

01:04:31.055 --> 01:04:32.765
We're against it!

01:04:32.848 --> 01:04:34.767
-We're against it!
-We're against it!

01:04:34.850 --> 01:04:38.729
We object to a special education school
without the residents' consent!

01:04:38.813 --> 01:04:40.398
-We object!
-We object!

01:04:40.481 --> 01:04:42.650
We object!

01:04:42.733 --> 01:04:44.193
-We object!
-We object!

01:04:44.276 --> 01:04:46.237
We object!

01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:48.280
-We object!
-We object!

01:04:48.364 --> 01:04:49.782
We object!

01:04:49.865 --> 01:04:51.575
-We object!
-We object!

01:04:51.659 --> 01:04:53.619
We object!

01:04:53.703 --> 01:04:55.204
-We object!
-We object!

01:04:55.287 --> 01:04:57.415
We object!

01:05:00.501 --> 01:05:03.212
Please allow my son to go to school.

01:05:03.295 --> 01:05:04.547
I'm begging you.

01:05:04.630 --> 01:05:06.924
He can go
to another special education school!

01:05:07.675 --> 01:05:09.677
That's a three-hour round trip.

01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:12.680
It's too long for a child in a wheelchair.

01:05:12.763 --> 01:05:13.973
Please, I'm begging you.

01:05:14.682 --> 01:05:15.683
Excuse me.

01:05:16.434 --> 01:05:18.477
Why do we have to worry
about your situation?

01:05:18.561 --> 01:05:20.980
We're people in need too!

01:05:21.063 --> 01:05:23.065
We had to live
in a rental our entire lives

01:05:23.149 --> 01:05:26.152
without eating or wearing what we want

01:05:26.235 --> 01:05:30.489
to save up our hard-earned money
to buy this small apartment.

01:05:30.573 --> 01:05:32.408
But because of you,

01:05:32.491 --> 01:05:34.869
it won't be worth crap now! Do you get it?

01:05:34.952 --> 01:05:37.288
Protect our property rights!

01:05:37.371 --> 01:05:39.248
-Protect them!
-Protect them!

01:05:39.331 --> 01:05:40.541
Protect them!

01:05:40.624 --> 01:05:44.962
-Protect them!
-Protect them!

01:05:45.046 --> 01:05:47.048
Protect them!

01:05:47.131 --> 01:05:48.132
Protect…

01:05:49.967 --> 01:05:51.677
So-min.

01:05:52.803 --> 01:05:54.638
Please, I beg of you!

01:05:54.722 --> 01:05:56.348
Please!

01:05:56.432 --> 01:05:57.892
We beg of you!

01:05:59.018 --> 01:06:00.019
Please.

01:06:03.898 --> 01:06:05.107
Please.

01:06:07.234 --> 01:06:08.194
Geez.

01:06:10.905 --> 01:06:12.198
Stop making a scene!

01:06:13.866 --> 01:06:15.785
Kneeling like this?

01:06:15.868 --> 01:06:18.245
I can kneel for you all you want!

01:06:18.329 --> 01:06:21.248
This apartment is our family's lifeline!

01:06:21.791 --> 01:06:23.250
Please let us live.

01:06:23.334 --> 01:06:26.045
-Please!
-Please let us live!

01:06:26.128 --> 01:06:28.130
Okay? Geez, don't beg!

01:06:28.214 --> 01:06:29.715
We're worried sick too!

01:06:29.799 --> 01:06:32.134
-Get up!
-Go somewhere else!

01:06:41.727 --> 01:06:43.896
Get up already!

01:06:48.109 --> 01:06:49.401
Please!

01:07:14.677 --> 01:07:16.387
Thank you again, Your Honor.

01:07:20.891 --> 01:07:23.352
Before I answer your question
from last time,

01:07:23.435 --> 01:07:26.981
can I ask you a question first?

01:07:27.606 --> 01:07:28.482
Yes.

01:07:28.983 --> 01:07:30.276
Thank you.

01:07:30.943 --> 01:07:32.111
Do you believe

01:07:32.820 --> 01:07:36.407
that miracles can happen?

01:07:37.366 --> 01:07:39.076
-Miracles?
-Yes.

01:07:40.744 --> 01:07:42.955
Like where I stand up
and walk on my own two legs,

01:07:43.664 --> 01:07:47.001
or my grandmother, who abandoned Mom,
comes back for her?

01:07:47.084 --> 01:07:48.627
That kind of miracle?

01:07:49.211 --> 01:07:50.212
Yes.

01:07:50.838 --> 01:07:54.925
You know perfectly well
those things don't exist.

01:07:57.344 --> 01:08:00.347
Then, let me ask you a random question.

01:08:00.931 --> 01:08:03.392
Your dream is to become
an astronaut, right?

01:08:04.059 --> 01:08:07.438
What? How did you know that?

01:08:07.521 --> 01:08:10.399
Isn't your favorite book
Romance of the Three Kingdoms?

01:08:11.275 --> 01:08:14.528
But you don't tell that to anyone
to not be teased for being an old soul.

01:08:15.196 --> 01:08:16.322
How did you…

01:08:17.239 --> 01:08:18.908
I've never told anyone that.

01:08:19.783 --> 01:08:22.077
What was your ideal type again?

01:08:22.161 --> 01:08:24.580
Right. Yu-Jeans…

01:08:24.663 --> 01:08:26.165
IVE? No.

01:08:26.248 --> 01:08:28.334
It's Yu-jin from IVE, isn't it?

01:08:29.084 --> 01:08:30.085
Grandpa!

01:08:30.169 --> 01:08:32.046
Was that also a secret no one knew?

01:08:33.339 --> 01:08:34.882
Think carefully.

01:08:34.965 --> 01:08:37.635
There's a friend you sometimes play with

01:08:38.219 --> 01:08:40.721
who you talk to
about everything for hours.

01:08:40.804 --> 01:08:41.805
A friend?

01:08:41.889 --> 01:08:43.098
Yeah.

01:08:45.517 --> 01:08:48.270
"I never give up."

01:08:48.354 --> 01:08:50.481
"I have a lot of damn time."

01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:52.483
What?

01:08:53.150 --> 01:08:54.485
No way. GoChamp?

01:08:55.152 --> 01:08:56.153
That's you?

01:09:02.952 --> 01:09:05.579
Yes, AlphaGo911.

01:09:05.663 --> 01:09:07.289
You little punk.

01:09:08.624 --> 01:09:10.876
It was impossible to beat you.

01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:14.880
How could you not let me win even once?
I've tried so many times.

01:09:16.382 --> 01:09:19.885
Why on earth are they talking
about "AlphaGo" and "GoChamp" right now?

01:09:19.969 --> 01:09:22.888
-It's the online Go game.
-Just a moment, Witness.

01:09:23.639 --> 01:09:27.893
Could you explain what is going on here?

01:09:27.977 --> 01:09:29.520
My apologies, Your Honor.

01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:30.938
Were you surprised?

01:09:31.814 --> 01:09:35.109
The world works
in mysterious ways sometimes.

01:09:36.318 --> 01:09:38.654
I didn't know either
until I saw the news about this trial

01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:40.656
that this little boy

01:09:41.949 --> 01:09:43.367
was my Go partner.

01:09:47.037 --> 01:09:50.249
I pretended to be young
since it was an online game,

01:09:50.332 --> 01:09:54.169
but I didn't know my opponent
was this young.

01:09:54.878 --> 01:09:58.132
I thought he'd be at least 15 or 16

01:09:58.716 --> 01:10:01.135
because he sounded like an old soul.

01:10:01.635 --> 01:10:02.761
What do you mean "old soul"?

01:10:12.187 --> 01:10:14.732
After being occupied
with work my whole life,

01:10:15.607 --> 01:10:17.192
I let my son go on to Heaven first,

01:10:17.860 --> 01:10:19.570
and it felt as if my world had collapsed.

01:10:20.696 --> 01:10:21.905
I didn't want to live anymore.

01:10:23.282 --> 01:10:25.743
I ignored work at the company

01:10:26.618 --> 01:10:28.495
and devoted my life to religion.

01:10:29.705 --> 01:10:32.041
I supported the anti-abortion groups

01:10:32.124 --> 01:10:35.461
that my son actively worked with
when he was alive.

01:10:36.128 --> 01:10:38.589
I thought perhaps my son

01:10:40.591 --> 01:10:43.469
would be happy about that
up there in Heaven.

01:10:49.725 --> 01:10:51.477
-Your Honor.
-Yes?

01:10:52.019 --> 01:10:53.479
May I stand up for a moment?

01:10:53.562 --> 01:10:54.980
Yes, you may.

01:10:55.647 --> 01:10:57.358
I'll help…

01:11:06.283 --> 01:11:07.659
While watching this trial,

01:11:09.286 --> 01:11:11.497
it made me think a lot.

01:11:14.208 --> 01:11:15.459
No matter how hard it is,

01:11:16.752 --> 01:11:20.255
my belief that this world
is worth living in has not changed.

01:11:20.339 --> 01:11:24.468
It's damaging for this smart, capable boy
to be born in this world?

01:11:24.551 --> 01:11:26.011
That's nonsense.

01:11:26.095 --> 01:11:29.306
I'll never accept such a conclusion.

01:11:29.890 --> 01:11:30.808
Counsel.

01:11:32.184 --> 01:11:35.562
Please drop this lawsuit.
This isn't right.

01:11:38.065 --> 01:11:40.359
Are you asking me to give up?

01:11:40.442 --> 01:11:42.486
I also don't know how to give up.

01:11:43.487 --> 01:11:46.824
I've never backed down from a fight.

01:11:46.907 --> 01:11:47.908
In return,

01:11:48.992 --> 01:11:50.661
I'll prove it myself

01:11:50.744 --> 01:11:54.957
to this young friend
that this world is worth living in.

01:11:55.541 --> 01:11:57.501
I'll stake the rest of my life on it.

01:11:57.584 --> 01:12:00.921
Mr. Choi, how are you going to prove that?

01:12:09.096 --> 01:12:11.432
I want to turn this incredible
and miraculous connection

01:12:13.725 --> 01:12:15.894
into a family bond.

01:12:20.607 --> 01:12:22.818
He said "family," didn't he?
He just said family!

01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:25.028
Mr. Choi?

01:12:25.654 --> 01:12:28.490
Are you talking about adoption,
by any chance?

01:12:29.074 --> 01:12:31.577
-Yes, Your Honor.
-He said "adoption"!

01:12:31.660 --> 01:12:33.579
I'm sorry,

01:12:33.662 --> 01:12:35.914
but to adopt him as a son…

01:12:35.998 --> 01:12:38.709
How should I put it?
The age difference is a bit too…

01:12:40.043 --> 01:12:42.296
Who said I was going to adopt him?

01:12:43.672 --> 01:12:46.049
Pardon? Then, who are you…

01:12:48.469 --> 01:12:50.053
-May I?
-Yes.

01:13:00.397 --> 01:13:01.398
Mr. Chairman?

01:13:23.378 --> 01:13:27.382
Will you accept
this stubborn old man as your father?

01:13:33.430 --> 01:13:35.474
Are you talking about an adult adoption?

01:13:38.101 --> 01:13:40.729
My only son
was about Gang-hun's mother's age

01:13:40.812 --> 01:13:42.981
when he passed away.

01:13:43.774 --> 01:13:46.193
I don't know if I'm going senile,

01:13:46.276 --> 01:13:47.486
but I keep thinking

01:13:48.153 --> 01:13:50.656
that this isn't a coincidence.

01:13:53.784 --> 01:13:55.536
Will you give the opportunity

01:13:57.538 --> 01:13:59.790
to this lonely old man?

01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:04.920
The opportunity to have
a dependable daughter and a smart grandson

01:14:06.421 --> 01:14:08.006
at the same time.

01:14:12.094 --> 01:14:13.220
Grandpa.

01:14:15.847 --> 01:14:17.516
-Your Honor.
-Yes?

01:14:20.602 --> 01:14:21.853
I promise.

01:14:21.937 --> 01:14:23.981
I'll make sure

01:14:24.773 --> 01:14:28.485
he never again has the horrible thought

01:14:29.611 --> 01:14:31.613
that it'd be better
to have never been born.

01:14:35.909 --> 01:14:40.455
I, Choi Woong-san, am a man of my word.

01:14:45.460 --> 01:14:48.338
-Order in the--
-Bailiff, it's okay.

01:15:13.030 --> 01:15:14.489
INCHEON DISTRICT COURT

01:15:20.203 --> 01:15:21.163
Right.

01:15:22.706 --> 01:15:23.707
I'm sorry.

01:15:24.416 --> 01:15:26.460
I brought up
such an outrageous idea so suddenly.

01:15:27.419 --> 01:15:28.420
It's okay.

01:15:28.503 --> 01:15:31.465
I know you did it for us.

01:15:32.924 --> 01:15:35.761
You don't have to decide right now.

01:15:35.844 --> 01:15:38.013
The three of us
should meet up often and talk.

01:15:38.096 --> 01:15:41.975
When you think you can trust this old man,
you can decide then.

01:15:43.644 --> 01:15:46.980
But even if you become my real grandpa,

01:15:47.064 --> 01:15:49.149
-I won't let you win in Go.
-What?

01:15:49.232 --> 01:15:50.776
A game is a game.

01:15:51.735 --> 01:15:52.861
You little brat!

01:15:52.944 --> 01:15:54.696
Don't you dare let me win.

01:15:54.780 --> 01:15:56.031
Or I'm going to scold you.

01:15:57.074 --> 01:15:59.576
There hasn't been a thing
I couldn't overcome.

01:15:59.660 --> 01:16:03.080
Just you wait.
We'll see who gets the last laugh.

01:16:06.333 --> 01:16:07.584
-Mr. Kang.
-Yes, sir?

01:16:07.668 --> 01:16:09.670
With the money
that was for building the chapel

01:16:10.712 --> 01:16:12.005
and the donations I made

01:16:12.089 --> 01:16:14.341
to Woongsan Welfare Foundation
and the Elliot Foundation,

01:16:16.009 --> 01:16:18.178
I'm going to build
a special education school.

01:16:19.471 --> 01:16:21.473
I'm going to examine each stair

01:16:22.140 --> 01:16:24.559
and each desk carefully myself.

01:16:25.394 --> 01:16:27.396
-Grandpa…
-My goodness!

01:16:31.525 --> 01:16:32.651
All right, then.

01:16:34.069 --> 01:16:35.570
Sir,

01:16:35.654 --> 01:16:37.781
I've been meaning to ask you something.

01:16:37.864 --> 01:16:40.117
-What is it?
-In Go! Go Game,

01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:41.868
the username has to be long.

01:16:41.952 --> 01:16:46.248
Gang-hun's is AlphaGo911.
What's your full username?

01:16:46.331 --> 01:16:49.543
My full username is… It's… Well…

01:16:49.626 --> 01:16:51.461
Does it…

01:16:52.254 --> 01:16:53.547
Does that matter?

01:16:53.630 --> 01:16:55.841
All right, bye! Let's go!

01:16:55.924 --> 01:16:57.342
Why is he stuttering?

01:16:57.426 --> 01:17:00.011
What was that? Gang-hun, do you know?

01:17:01.471 --> 01:17:02.681
What is it?

01:17:03.348 --> 01:17:04.433
What?

01:17:06.393 --> 01:17:07.394
What?

01:17:08.019 --> 01:17:09.438
Handsome_GoChamp?

01:17:11.565 --> 01:17:12.566
Goodbye, now!

01:17:12.649 --> 01:17:14.109
Yes. Bye.

01:17:14.192 --> 01:17:15.861
-Wait, Mr. Chairman!
-Let's go now!

01:17:15.944 --> 01:17:17.279
Is it really "Handsome"?

01:17:18.029 --> 01:17:19.698
Who knew he liked that kind of stuff?

01:17:19.781 --> 01:17:21.950
-Let's go.
-Isn't that a scam?

01:17:23.452 --> 01:17:25.662
That's fraud, Chairman Handsome.

01:17:25.746 --> 01:17:27.414
Don't let Da-wit fool you.

01:17:27.497 --> 01:17:29.416
He's a criminal who took a huge bribe.

01:17:29.499 --> 01:17:32.753
And he's a brutal murderer
who pushed a good businessman to death.

01:17:32.836 --> 01:17:34.129
Chairman Handsome,

01:17:34.212 --> 01:17:36.882
I'll see you in court soon!

01:17:36.965 --> 01:17:39.634
RESTRICTED NUMBER

01:17:40.177 --> 01:17:42.387
Hey, hold on tight.

01:17:47.517 --> 01:17:49.311
Be careful.

01:17:49.394 --> 01:17:52.814
This is so… Goodness.

01:17:54.608 --> 01:17:55.609
Ms. Park?

01:18:09.456 --> 01:18:12.125
STAY TUNED TO WATCH THE EPILOGUE

01:18:30.602 --> 01:18:31.436
Pro Bono Avengers!

01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:33.563
Let's play dirty.

01:18:33.647 --> 01:18:36.233
Don't be goody-goodies. Play dirty, okay?

01:18:36.316 --> 01:18:38.568
Is this Team Pro Bono?

01:18:38.652 --> 01:18:40.153
I want to get a divorce.

01:18:40.237 --> 01:18:41.488
I bet you're very popular.

01:18:41.571 --> 01:18:42.948
Am I pretty?

01:18:43.031 --> 01:18:45.158
Pathological jealousy, verbal abuse, and…

01:18:45.242 --> 01:18:49.913
-The trial was over. Why suddenly do that?
-Things aren't always what they seem.

01:18:49.996 --> 01:18:52.833
That ungrateful girl made it all up.

01:18:52.916 --> 01:18:55.794
The whole village knows
that family wants a child.

01:18:55.877 --> 01:18:58.755
I heard the governor's daughter-in-law
wears short skirts

01:18:58.839 --> 01:19:00.549
and a bit promiscuous.

01:19:00.632 --> 01:19:01.967
Why did you lie?

01:19:02.050 --> 01:19:05.095
You should've pretended you didn't know.

01:19:05.178 --> 01:19:06.721
-It's not true, is it?
-Brazen bitch.

01:19:06.805 --> 01:19:09.224
You have to tell us. What on earth…

01:19:09.307 --> 01:19:11.935
What on earth happened that day?

01:19:15.522 --> 01:19:17.023
Mr. Jang, how did it go?

01:19:17.107 --> 01:19:18.441
I looked into it.

01:19:18.525 --> 01:19:21.820
On that day last year
when So-min didn't come home until late,

01:19:21.903 --> 01:19:23.363
she was on Jamsil Bridge.

01:19:23.947 --> 01:19:25.365
Jamsil Bridge? Why?

01:19:25.448 --> 01:19:27.075
The day she was abandoned,

01:19:27.659 --> 01:19:29.953
-she went to Magic Land with her mom.
-I see.

01:19:30.537 --> 01:19:33.665
On that day, she was leaning
dangerously against the rail for a while,

01:19:33.748 --> 01:19:34.875
so someone called the cops.

01:19:34.958 --> 01:19:37.586
I'll be with her all day
so she won't do something unthinkable.

01:19:37.669 --> 01:19:39.629
-Are you going to be with her forever?
-What?

01:19:39.713 --> 01:19:41.214
It might happen every year.

01:19:42.132 --> 01:19:44.175
And Gang-hun can't stop it by himself.

01:19:44.259 --> 01:19:46.720
-What now?
-Seriously.

01:19:47.262 --> 01:19:48.722
On Hangang River bridges these days,

01:19:48.805 --> 01:19:51.850
they have things called lifeline phones.

01:19:52.601 --> 01:19:54.060
I don't know if they can help.

01:19:55.437 --> 01:19:57.647
-Hey, Stretch.
-Me?

01:19:57.731 --> 01:19:58.690
Yes, you.

01:19:59.900 --> 01:20:01.776
Hey, you were smart after all! Ms. Park.

01:20:01.860 --> 01:20:03.528
The phones? I'll check.

01:20:03.612 --> 01:20:04.487
Mr. Jang?

01:20:04.571 --> 01:20:06.615
I might be able to remodel an old phone.

01:20:06.698 --> 01:20:08.366
-Ms. Yoo.
-What if we put lights in it

01:20:08.450 --> 01:20:09.910
-so it stands out?
-Why put lights?

01:20:11.745 --> 01:20:12.746
No, you're good.

01:20:12.829 --> 01:20:14.164
No, I mean…

01:20:14.748 --> 01:20:16.166
Why remodel the box, Yeong-sil?

01:20:16.249 --> 01:20:18.335
Why am I the only one who doesn't get it?

01:20:18.418 --> 01:20:20.420
What am I supposed to do?

01:20:21.046 --> 01:20:22.088
Mr. Kang?

01:20:26.551 --> 01:20:28.553
