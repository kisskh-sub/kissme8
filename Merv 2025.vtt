11:29.750 --> 11:31.458
No, I haven't.

11:31.541 --> 11:33.790
You didn't come to the game with me. Hmm?

11:33.875 --> 11:36.165
And you didn't come for birthday pizza.

11:36.250 --> 11:39.458
Look, man, I know this time
hasn't been easy for you,

11:39.540 --> 11:42.540
but I think it's about time you started
hanging out with other people.

11:42.625 --> 11:44.125
I do hang out with other people.

11:44.208 --> 11:46.750
Those nine-year-olds in there
do not count.

11:46.833 --> 11:50.208
Well, I appreciate your concern.
I'm just...

11:50.290 --> 11:53.208
[crying] really enjoying
being by myself right now.

11:53.290 --> 11:55.165
Oh, really? On Christmas?

11:55.250 --> 11:56.500
A: It's not Christmas.

11:56.583 --> 11:58.375
And B: I have Merv.

11:58.958 --> 11:59.875
The dog?

12:01.708 --> 12:04.125
Don't go back to being that guy.

12:04.208 --> 12:05.458
What guy?

12:05.541 --> 12:07.083
The No Guy.

12:07.166 --> 12:09.166
-The No Guy?
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.

12:09.250 --> 12:10.916
Yeah, and then you and her got together

12:11.000 --> 12:13.250
and she started being like,
"Hey, you want to do stuff?"

12:13.333 --> 12:14.541
And you were like, "Mm-kay."

12:14.625 --> 12:18.291
Then boom!
You eating sushi and flying to Greenland.

12:18.375 --> 12:20.375
-Iceland.
-Whatever.

12:20.458 --> 12:22.708
You said yes to everything.

12:22.791 --> 12:25.041
And now look at you, man. [chuckles]

12:25.125 --> 12:26.166
The No Guy.

12:26.250 --> 12:28.333
-[automated voice] No.
-That's you.

12:28.416 --> 12:29.750
No.

12:29.833 --> 12:31.916
I am not a No Guy.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.165
-Oh, okay. Okay. Call Brené.
-No.

12:34.250 --> 12:36.125
-Ah! [laughing]
-[automated voice] No!

12:36.208 --> 12:38.125
That's a cheap trick.

12:38.208 --> 12:40.500
Hey, hey. The candy budget's getting low.

12:40.583 --> 12:42.000
You don't even need that much.

12:42.083 --> 12:43.415
The chocolate gonna kill the dog.

12:43.500 --> 12:44.665
Enjoy Disney on Ice.

12:44.750 --> 12:46.125
Russ! Don't be throwing chocolate at me.

12:46.208 --> 12:49.000
You know I was-- Oh! Oh, okay.

12:49.083 --> 12:51.083
[soft piano music playing]

12:57.500 --> 12:58.583
Oh.

13:00.458 --> 13:03.916
You didn't... have to do that.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.208
Did I not do it right?

13:05.291 --> 13:08.583
No, I just, um...
I like to butter my own bread.

13:08.666 --> 13:11.125
Is that a control issue thing?

13:11.208 --> 13:13.083
-No, I just like--
-Like to be in control.

13:13.166 --> 13:16.083
No, I just like to manage
my own bread. [chuckles]

13:16.166 --> 13:18.375
-The red?
-Right here.

13:18.458 --> 13:20.000
"Mer-lot." It's my favorite.

13:21.083 --> 13:23.125
-[waiter] And a spicy margarita.
-Thank you.

13:23.208 --> 13:24.291
Be careful. It's hot.

13:24.375 --> 13:26.458
Not too hot for a little lady, I hope.

13:26.541 --> 13:29.166
[chuckles] You just worry
about yourself, Mr. Mer-lot.

13:29.250 --> 13:30.875
[both chuckling]

13:32.915 --> 13:33.958
Too hot?

13:34.040 --> 13:36.040
[coughs]

13:36.125 --> 13:38.540
No, it tastes delicious.

13:38.625 --> 13:42.000
So, your profile said that you recently
got out of a long-term relationship.

13:42.083 --> 13:43.958
Uh, yep, I did.

13:44.040 --> 13:45.875
Do you still have feelings for him?

13:46.458 --> 13:48.665
No. Why would I-- No, no.

13:48.750 --> 13:50.375
We're just two people who share a dog.

13:50.458 --> 13:53.375
You share a dog?
That's... that's a red flag.

13:53.958 --> 13:55.415
Okay, my turn to ask a question.

13:55.500 --> 13:57.915
Shoot. They call me Ken-do, by the way.

13:58.000 --> 14:02.416
Okay. Ken-don't interrupt me
while I'm asking this important question.

14:02.500 --> 14:03.625
Your house is on fire.

14:03.708 --> 14:04.916
Oh, I don't have a house.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.250
I have a condo.

14:06.333 --> 14:08.500
With two parking spots, by the way.
Tandem.

14:08.583 --> 14:11.208
Okay, you're in your condo.

14:11.291 --> 14:12.500
It's burning down.

14:12.583 --> 14:14.958
You've saved all your pets,
your loved ones,

14:15.041 --> 14:17.416
but you can only save one more thing.
What is it?

14:19.041 --> 14:21.083
Easy. My safe.

14:21.791 --> 14:22.875
Oh. You have a safe?

14:22.958 --> 14:24.333
Doesn't everybody?

14:24.416 --> 14:25.416
-I don't.
-You should totally.

14:25.500 --> 14:27.166
Seriously, I keep
all my valuables in there.

14:27.250 --> 14:30.375
-My will, my passport, my gun. It--
-[coughs]

14:31.000 --> 14:32.915
Um... this has been nice.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.833
I agree.

14:34.915 --> 14:37.458
So, uh, what are you thinking?
Should we split a few appetizers,

14:37.540 --> 14:39.583
or do you want to just
go straight to dessert?

14:39.665 --> 14:42.290
Mm. I think, uh...

14:42.375 --> 14:45.000
[coughing]

14:46.250 --> 14:47.915
I think I'm good with bread.

14:48.665 --> 14:50.540
[sighs]

14:50.625 --> 14:51.875
Hi, Mervy.

14:51.958 --> 14:54.290
Where are you?
I could really use a cuddle right now.

14:54.375 --> 14:55.875
[Merv whines softly]

14:55.958 --> 14:57.125
Merv?

14:57.208 --> 14:59.458
[whines]

14:59.540 --> 15:01.916
Merv.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.666
Are you okay?

15:03.750 --> 15:05.208
Mervy.

15:05.291 --> 15:06.541
What's wrong, bud?

15:07.625 --> 15:09.625
[ringtone playing]

15:15.791 --> 15:18.208
-[lighthearted music playing]
-[squeaky chittering]

15:20.375 --> 15:22.375
[clucking]

15:24.791 --> 15:26.791
[hissing and rattling]

15:30.791 --> 15:33.375
[chittering]

15:33.458 --> 15:35.500
-You didn't have to come.
-Yeah, I know.

15:35.583 --> 15:37.290
I would've kept you in the loop.

15:37.375 --> 15:40.958
I would prefer to hear what the vet
has to say firsthand, thank you.

15:41.040 --> 15:42.583
[chicken clucks]

15:43.665 --> 15:45.040
[vet assistant] Russ and Anna for Merv.

15:45.125 --> 15:46.750
Dr. Bankert's ready to see you.

15:46.833 --> 15:48.165
Okay.

15:49.375 --> 15:51.625
-[whines]
-[Dr. Bankert] What's up, Merv?

15:52.750 --> 15:53.958
[Anna] Hi, Mervy.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.540
[yelps, whines]

15:55.625 --> 15:57.958
-[panting]
-[Russ] Oh, there he is.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.500
[chuckles] Hi, buddy.

15:59.583 --> 16:00.916
-Were you a good boy? Mm.
-[Anna] Are you feeling better?

16:01.000 --> 16:02.541
-Come here, buddy.
-Come here. Come on. Mm.

16:02.625 --> 16:04.291
-Good boy. We were so worried about you.
-Yeah, we missed you.

16:04.375 --> 16:06.041
-We missed you.
-Aw, buddy.

16:06.125 --> 16:07.666
Aw. How's he doing? Is he doing okay?

16:07.750 --> 16:09.791
-He seems okay.
-Yes. Vitals are fine.

16:09.875 --> 16:12.541
Eyes are clear. Breathing is normal.

16:12.625 --> 16:16.083
From where I'm standing,
he is a pretty healthy pup.

16:16.166 --> 16:17.875
[sighs heavily] Thank goodness.

16:17.958 --> 16:19.375
I don't get it, 'cause he was, like,

16:19.458 --> 16:21.833
-flat out on the floor when I got home.
-[Russ] Yeah.

16:21.916 --> 16:23.875
[Anna] He wouldn't even
perk up for a treat.

16:23.958 --> 16:25.500
Have you ever seen him like that before?

16:25.583 --> 16:27.125
He hasn't been himself lately.

16:27.208 --> 16:29.458
No, he hasn't.
He's been, like, mopey all the time.

16:29.541 --> 16:31.916
It's so unlike him.
Plus, he loves Christmas.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.958
It sounds dramatic,
but it's his favorite holiday.

16:34.040 --> 16:35.250
-[laughs]
-He loves it.

16:35.333 --> 16:37.415
[Russ] Yeah, it just, uh,
doesn't make sense, you know.

16:38.915 --> 16:41.583
Unless, have you been taking him running?

16:41.665 --> 16:43.290
-Yeah, of course. Yeah, he loves running.
-[Anna scoffs]

16:43.375 --> 16:44.750
-[Russ] Don't you, buddy?
-[Merv grumbles]

16:44.833 --> 16:46.708
[scoffs] He only has little legs,

16:46.790 --> 16:49.875
and you take him on those long
Neanderthal man runs.

16:49.958 --> 16:52.458
I mean, nobody needs to run
ten miles, right? [chuckles]

16:53.540 --> 16:54.625
[Russ chuckles]

16:54.708 --> 16:56.208
-Are you saying this is my fault?
-No.

16:56.290 --> 16:58.915
I'm just saying sometimes you overdo it.

16:59.875 --> 17:00.916
Overdo it?

17:01.000 --> 17:02.583
We haven't been overdoing it.

17:02.666 --> 17:05.333
I mean, I don't know, maybe perhap--
Have you not been walking him enough?

17:05.415 --> 17:07.083
Merv and I have a very busy schedule.

17:07.165 --> 17:09.208
[Russ] Well, maybe he doesn't love
to have a busy schedule.

17:09.290 --> 17:10.583
Maybe he likes a little bit more chill.

17:10.665 --> 17:12.500
-Maybe you give him too much chill.
-I-- [chuckles]

17:12.583 --> 17:13.958
-[all chuckle]
-Or maybe,

17:14.040 --> 17:16.708
I don't know, maybe it could be that weird
blue sludge you insist on feeding him.

17:16.790 --> 17:18.790
The blue sludge?
You mean the superfood supplement...

17:18.875 --> 17:21.958
-Right, yeah.
-...that our veterinarian said

17:22.040 --> 17:23.875
-I was going above and beyond for?
-Yeah.

17:23.958 --> 17:25.333
Yeah, but it might be bringing him down,
you know.

17:25.415 --> 17:27.625
It'd certainly bum me out
if I was made to eat blue food.

17:27.708 --> 17:29.375
So you two broke up?

17:29.458 --> 17:30.458
-Oh, yeah.
-Yes, we did.

17:30.541 --> 17:32.000
Oh. Didn't see that one coming.

17:32.083 --> 17:34.458
I usually do with my patients.

17:34.541 --> 17:35.916
You seemed so...

17:38.083 --> 17:39.166
Never mind.

17:39.250 --> 17:40.916
-So, what's wrong with him?
-Yeah.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.541
Well, judging from
my clinical observations,

17:43.625 --> 17:45.208
I believe Merv is sad.

17:45.291 --> 17:46.291
-Sad?
-What?

17:46.375 --> 17:47.458
He's suffering from depression.

17:47.541 --> 17:48.625
-[groans]
-[Russ] Why would he be depressed?

17:48.708 --> 17:49.625
[Anna] Yeah, no, no.

17:49.708 --> 17:50.958
Merv is crushing life, okay?

17:51.041 --> 17:54.541
Dogs are very sensitive to anything
that throws their routine.

17:54.625 --> 17:56.750
You know, like a breakup.

17:56.833 --> 17:59.000
You think Merv is depressed
because we broke up?

17:59.583 --> 18:01.000
[Anna] So, how can we help?

18:01.083 --> 18:03.583
Well, you can try giving him
extra love and attention.

18:03.666 --> 18:06.583
And if that doesn't work,
there's always Xanax.

18:06.666 --> 18:07.958
[Anna] Xanax?

18:08.041 --> 18:09.833
-Like "Xanax" Xanax?
-Oh, my God.

18:09.916 --> 18:11.958
What he's going through is dangerous.

18:12.041 --> 18:14.583
The imbalance, anxiety.

18:14.666 --> 18:15.750
It's bad for his heart.

18:15.833 --> 18:17.791
His heart? His little heart?

18:17.875 --> 18:19.125
We'll give it two weeks.

18:19.208 --> 18:22.208
If he doesn't show signs
of improvement then,

18:22.291 --> 18:23.375
we'll have to medicate.

18:25.291 --> 18:27.833
-[student] I want to pet him.
-You guys can pet him if you want.

18:27.916 --> 18:29.166
-[students murmuring]
-[student] Hi, Merv.

18:29.250 --> 18:31.208
[Russ] Just have to be
really gentle with him, okay?

18:31.291 --> 18:32.791
Why? What's wrong with him?

18:33.583 --> 18:35.541
Well, he's-he's just feeling a bit sad.

18:35.625 --> 18:37.083
-That's all.
-Oh.

18:37.166 --> 18:39.625
-[student] Aw. Why is he so sad?
-[student 2] Hi, Merv.

18:40.333 --> 18:42.041
[students murmuring]

18:42.791 --> 18:44.625
[Russ] Oh, God.

18:44.708 --> 18:46.416
[gentle music playing]

18:46.500 --> 18:50.291
[Russ] All right, buddy.
I think you're gonna love this.

18:50.375 --> 18:51.625
Ready?

18:58.625 --> 19:00.708
Oh... [sighs]

19:02.250 --> 19:03.750
[whines]

19:03.833 --> 19:05.333
-Don't start with me, Merv.
-[whining]

19:05.416 --> 19:07.208
A dog's got to pee. Come on.

19:08.083 --> 19:10.083
[vehicle passing]

19:11.791 --> 19:13.875
[Merv grumbles]

19:15.666 --> 19:19.958
-Warm places for dogs.
-[typing]

19:20.041 --> 19:21.750
[sighs]

19:21.833 --> 19:23.875
"Gourmet hot dogs." No.

19:24.875 --> 19:26.291
"Sunnyside Dog Beach."

19:27.291 --> 19:31.500
This is it. "Sunnyside Dog Beach.
The ultimate pet holiday paradise."

19:31.583 --> 19:32.791
[Merv whines]

19:32.875 --> 19:33.958
Oh, look. A dog hotel.

19:34.041 --> 19:35.125
[chuckling] The Paw Seasons.

19:35.208 --> 19:36.250
Merv.

19:36.333 --> 19:37.875
This is it. There's a dog beach.

19:37.958 --> 19:40.250
There's a beach for dogs.

19:40.333 --> 19:42.666
High five. We're going, buddy.

19:42.750 --> 19:44.541
We are going.

19:44.625 --> 19:45.625
[knocking at door]

19:46.666 --> 19:47.666
[Anna] Hi.

19:47.750 --> 19:49.041
-[yelps softly]
-[Russ] Uh, hi.

19:49.125 --> 19:50.125
[barks]

19:50.208 --> 19:51.458
-What--
-Is this a bad time?

19:51.541 --> 19:52.875
-Yeah, it's not a good time.
-[Merv barks]

19:52.958 --> 19:54.666
Oh, hi, Merv. I brought you a treat.

19:54.750 --> 19:56.375
She's not coming in.
Merv, she's-- Back you go.

19:56.458 --> 19:57.708
-Merv, I brought you a treat.
-Anna, what--

19:57.791 --> 19:58.791
Ma, I got to go.

19:58.875 --> 20:00.291
Okay. Bye.

20:00.375 --> 20:01.916
Oh, my-- Wow.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.416
"Wow," what?

20:03.500 --> 20:05.458
I just... Oh, my God.

20:05.541 --> 20:08.041
[Russ] What? "Oh, my God," what?

20:08.125 --> 20:09.833

I was reading a lot about
[whispers] depression.

20:22.416 --> 20:25.666
And, um, I just... I just made, like,
a little superfood mix

20:25.750 --> 20:30.833

some symptoms of ennui, sadness.

Thank you.

20:45.666 --> 20:50.166
So, um, if you could just put half a cup
on his kibble, that would be great.

20:53.375 --> 20:54.958
Are you taking him somewhere?

20:55.041 --> 20:56.000
[Russ] No. What?

20:56.083 --> 20:57.833
Our dog. Are you taking him somewhere?

20:57.916 --> 21:00.333
Yeah, actually, as it happens,
I'm going on a boys' trip.

21:00.416 --> 21:02.625
-Boys' trip? Where?
-To a dog beach.

21:03.500 --> 21:04.750
In Florida.

21:04.833 --> 21:06.875
You can't take him to Florida.
He hates beaches.

21:06.958 --> 21:09.791
No, you hate beaches. He's actually never
been to a beach 'cause you wouldn't go.

21:09.875 --> 21:11.583
And no offense, Anna, but it's kind of

21:11.666 --> 21:13.208
none of your business
what I do on my week.

21:13.291 --> 21:16.875
Oh. Well, actually it is
when it concerns our dog's mental health

21:16.958 --> 21:19.000
and he's just been diagnosed
with depression.

21:19.083 --> 21:21.541
Well, I spoke to the vet,
and she said he's fit to fly, so--

21:21.625 --> 21:23.916
-You're taking him on a plane?
-Yeah. I'm not driving.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.541
It's 18 hours.

21:25.625 --> 21:27.208
Flying is super stressful.

21:27.291 --> 21:29.083
It's lucky he's taking
his emotional support human.

21:29.166 --> 21:30.250

21:35.333 --> 21:37.833
-Surely, you can understand that.
-Yeah, I can understand that, Anna.

21:37.916 --> 21:40.708
What I also understand is
our dog hates the cold

21:40.791 --> 21:43.041
and nothing I do seems
to even remotely cheer him up,

21:43.125 --> 21:46.291
so I thought I'd take him to this beach
that's just for dogs,

21:46.375 --> 21:49.250
and he can frolic around in the sea
and eat dogsicles

21:49.333 --> 21:53.000
and get a suntan, I don't know,
and maybe find his lust for life again.

21:53.083 --> 21:54.833
Surely, you can understand that.

21:57.333 --> 22:00.500

sounds like a good idea.

No, I-I'm not going back to the hotel.
I'm going home.

48:25.750 --> 48:28.208
-What?
-Back to Boston.

48:28.291 --> 48:32.166
Wait a second, Anna.
What happened to team cheer-up?

48:32.250 --> 48:33.250
Doing anything for Merv?

48:33.333 --> 48:34.875
Putting our differences aside
for the week?

48:36.333 --> 48:39.500
If you and I were a band,

48:39.583 --> 48:41.583
we'd be called The Mistakes.

48:42.708 --> 48:43.708
[whines softly]

48:44.333 --> 48:45.625
Merv doesn't want you to leave.

48:47.166 --> 48:49.000
He told me.

48:49.083 --> 48:50.333
He told you?

48:50.416 --> 48:53.000
Something about you bringing back
his "joie division."

48:53.083 --> 48:55.125
[both laugh]

48:56.083 --> 48:57.875
[lighthearted music playing]

48:57.958 --> 48:59.541
[moans softly]

49:03.083 --> 49:05.083
[dog barking]

49:09.333 --> 49:10.458
[knocking on door]

49:11.541 --> 49:13.291
Hey. Morning.

49:13.375 --> 49:16.666
So, um, remember how much
Merv loves my folks?

49:16.750 --> 49:19.250
And they're literally just up the coast,

49:19.333 --> 49:22.541
and I kind of promised them that
we'd go and see them for a little bit.

49:24.541 --> 49:29.208
Okay. You just got me to stay,
and now you casually float out there,

49:29.291 --> 49:31.625
"Let's go see my parents," who hate me.

49:31.708 --> 49:34.000
They don't hate you.
And isn't the whole point that we spend

49:34.083 --> 49:35.875
some time together for Merv?

49:35.958 --> 49:37.500
Plus, my mom really wants to see you.

49:37.583 --> 49:39.458
Oh, no. No, she doesn't.

49:39.541 --> 49:42.625
She's blocked me on all the apps,
which is fine

49:42.708 --> 49:44.916
because her posts have become
really problematic lately,

49:45.000 --> 49:46.000
-but it's true.
-Yeah.

49:46.083 --> 49:47.791
She's just being protective
of her only son.

49:47.875 --> 49:50.500
I get it...

49:50.583 --> 49:54.291
but my answer is no, I'm not going,
and I'm firm on that.

49:54.375 --> 49:56.666
[lighthearted music playing]

49:56.750 --> 49:58.625
Okay, so...

49:58.708 --> 50:01.250
we are in and out of there, okay?

50:01.333 --> 50:03.375
-Two hours, max, I promise.
-Okay.

50:03.458 --> 50:04.500
[Russ sniffs]

50:05.583 --> 50:07.750
So, how's your dad?

50:07.833 --> 50:09.500
Yeah, I think he's okay, actually.

50:09.583 --> 50:11.333
The sun's certainly helping.

50:11.416 --> 50:13.750
-And the pickleball.
-Oh. Does he play?

50:13.833 --> 50:15.916
Oh, no. No, he-he just watches.

50:16.000 --> 50:17.625
-Oh, he's just a fan?
-Oh, yeah.

50:17.708 --> 50:18.916
[both laugh]

50:19.000 --> 50:20.875
-Yeah.
-Okay.

50:20.958 --> 50:22.041
[phone dings]

50:22.708 --> 50:24.541
[Russ] Oh. Oh, looks like, um,

50:24.625 --> 50:27.000
"Lover Not a Fighter 83"
just sent you a rose.

50:27.083 --> 50:28.583
Don't read my messages.

50:28.666 --> 50:30.625
I'm sorry. I didn't. It pinged.

50:30.708 --> 50:31.708
It was right there.

50:31.791 --> 50:34.250
Wow. So you're doing the whole,
uh, dating app thing.

50:35.291 --> 50:36.541
It's a little surprising.

50:36.625 --> 50:38.458
Why?

50:38.541 --> 50:40.500
[Anna scoffs]

50:40.583 --> 50:42.458
-Huh?
-You should try it. It's fun.

50:42.541 --> 50:43.583
[whines softly]

50:43.666 --> 50:46.000
So go on, who have you been meeting
on the... on the app?

50:46.083 --> 50:48.583
Oh, all sorts of people. I mean, I, um...

50:48.666 --> 50:50.666
I went on a date with a poet.

50:51.708 --> 50:53.625
Cool. Is he broke?

50:53.708 --> 50:56.291
Uh, no, he's very rich.

50:56.375 --> 50:57.833
Nice. That's cool.

50:57.916 --> 50:59.625
-Mm-hmm.
-What kind of poetry does he write?

51:00.458 --> 51:03.583
Verses, sonnets, um...

51:04.666 --> 51:07.208
-He's really good at rhyming things.
-Sonnets?

51:08.375 --> 51:09.666
How old is he?

51:10.750 --> 51:11.750
A hundred and fifty.

51:11.833 --> 51:13.416
-[Russ laughs]
-It's actually really exhausting

51:13.500 --> 51:15.250
kind of like keeping up with

51:15.333 --> 51:17.625
-all the messages from...
-[Merv whines, grunts softly]

51:17.708 --> 51:19.416
-Yeah, I'm sure.
-...gentleman callers.

51:19.500 --> 51:23.250
Well, maybe you need a more
kind of robust vetting process, maybe.

51:23.333 --> 51:24.791
-Oh, I have one.
-Oh, you do?

51:24.875 --> 51:26.833
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I just ask the same question.

51:26.916 --> 51:28.166
Yeah?

51:28.250 --> 51:29.791
It's, um...

51:29.875 --> 51:32.750
Okay. So your house is on fire

51:32.833 --> 51:36.375
and you can only take one thing--
what is it?

51:36.458 --> 51:39.000
-You've already saved humans and pets.
-It's a great question.

51:39.083 --> 51:40.208
-Thank you.
-What do they say?

51:40.291 --> 51:43.208
He said he would take his, uh, safe.

51:44.583 --> 51:46.458
The poet has a safe?

51:46.541 --> 51:47.916
-[laughing] Yeah.
-What-- For what?

51:48.000 --> 51:49.708
Like, quills and stuff?

51:49.791 --> 51:51.708
Yeah, quills, for sure.
Parchment and stuff.

51:51.791 --> 51:54.166
All right, then what about you?
What would you save?

51:54.250 --> 51:56.125
-Wouldn't you like to know?
-Oh, I do know.

51:56.208 --> 51:57.250
-No, you don't.
-Yes, I do.

51:57.333 --> 51:58.333
-You definitely don't.
-I bet you I do.

51:58.416 --> 51:59.416
-Mm-mm.
-Your acoustic guitar.

51:59.500 --> 52:01.333
[gasps] My dad made it with his own hands.

52:01.416 --> 52:02.625
You've never actually played it.

52:02.708 --> 52:03.916
I know, but I could do.

52:04.000 --> 52:05.333
You might want to get on with it.

52:05.416 --> 52:06.625
What would you save?

52:08.375 --> 52:09.625
Nothing.

52:10.291 --> 52:12.250
-That's not an answer. No.
-Yeah, it is. Sure, it is.

52:12.333 --> 52:14.333
Yeah, it's my list, and I-I say nothing.

52:16.875 --> 52:19.416
-So you'd just let it all burn?
-Yeah, I would.

52:20.791 --> 52:22.833
I think if you're gonna lose
everything anyway,

52:22.916 --> 52:25.000
you might as well make a fresh start.

52:25.083 --> 52:27.333
[gentle music playing]

52:34.958 --> 52:36.083
[whines softly]

52:44.208 --> 52:45.291
[Russ] Hi, Mom.

52:45.375 --> 52:47.375
Oh! Look who's here.

52:47.458 --> 52:49.000
-[vehicle door opens]
-Oh.

52:50.083 --> 52:51.416
[Russ] Let's go. Go. [whistles]

52:51.500 --> 52:54.041
-[MJ] Oh.
-[Merv barks, pants]

52:54.125 --> 52:57.458
[both] Aw. Mm.

52:57.541 --> 52:59.875
-You look so nice.
-Oh, no. [sputters]

52:59.958 --> 53:01.333
Hi, MJ.

53:02.875 --> 53:04.000
Come on in.

53:05.458 --> 53:07.708
Thought you said
that she wanted to see me.

53:07.791 --> 53:09.250
I said that?

53:10.625 --> 53:11.750
Are his feet clean?

53:11.833 --> 53:13.333
Yes, Mom, his feet are clean.

53:13.416 --> 53:14.833
-Can you go easy on him?
-[growling softly]

53:14.916 --> 53:17.083
-He's having a rough time at the moment.
-Oh, I forgot.

53:17.166 --> 53:19.708
Dog depression. Yeah.

53:19.791 --> 53:21.625
Hey. How are you?

53:21.708 --> 53:23.791
-Okay. He doesn't look depressed.
-Okay.

53:23.875 --> 53:25.125
Uh, where's Dad?

53:25.208 --> 53:26.625
He's in the back cremating the chicken.

53:26.708 --> 53:28.041
-Oh, I'm gonna surprise him.
-Yeah. All right.

53:28.125 --> 53:29.375
I'm on the drinks, so...

53:30.458 --> 53:32.208
I can help with that.

53:34.500 --> 53:36.125
[whining]

53:45.041 --> 53:48.083
-[Russ grunts, chuckles]
-Uh-huh. There he is.

53:48.166 --> 53:49.958
-How's it going, Dad?
-Oh, it's good.

53:50.041 --> 53:51.833
-Oh, it's so good to see you.
-Yeah. You, too.

53:51.916 --> 53:53.041
-How was traffic?
-Yeah, pretty smooth.

53:53.125 --> 53:54.541
-Yeah?
-Don't get up. It's all right.

53:54.625 --> 53:57.208
No, no. I need a proper hug, please.

53:57.291 --> 53:59.416
Oh, now...

53:59.500 --> 54:01.750
-So good to see you.
-Yeah. You, too.

54:01.833 --> 54:03.875
-You look well. You look really well.
-Oh. Thanks.

54:03.958 --> 54:05.875
-Not as good as you, but...
-[laughs]

54:05.958 --> 54:07.708
[Russ] Oh, look who it is.

54:07.791 --> 54:09.458
I've got a treat for you, mister.

54:09.541 --> 54:11.416
-Oh, lucky boy.
-Look at that.

54:11.500 --> 54:13.291
[Russ] Lucky boy.

54:13.375 --> 54:14.500
[Jack] He looks happy.

54:25.291 --> 54:26.791
It's so nice here.

54:27.875 --> 54:30.333
So many decorative mailboxes.

54:30.416 --> 54:32.000
[chuckles]

54:32.083 --> 54:33.333
You two must love it.

54:33.416 --> 54:35.375
Nope. Not really.

54:35.458 --> 54:37.333
That's too bad.

54:37.416 --> 54:41.250
Well, I preferred our place
in Arizona, but...

54:41.333 --> 54:44.291
too many stairs for Jack
after his heart attack, so...

54:45.875 --> 54:47.458
Oh, they're big.

54:47.541 --> 54:51.208
Oh, no stress.
I can just cut them smaller.

54:56.750 --> 54:57.750
Your hair.

54:59.166 --> 55:02.958
-You did something different.
-Yeah. I cut bangs.

55:03.041 --> 55:05.375
-Do you like it?
-I liked it before.

55:07.375 --> 55:09.833
Yeah, I guess I just, um, needed a change.

55:09.916 --> 55:12.708
[laughing] Yeah. Apparently.

55:19.791 --> 55:21.000
-[Jack chuckling]
-Gin-coming.

55:21.083 --> 55:22.083
Oh!

55:22.166 --> 55:23.166
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

55:23.250 --> 55:24.250
-Mm-hmm. Yep.
-Should I take it?

55:24.333 --> 55:25.291
Oh, thank you.

55:25.375 --> 55:26.541
[sighs]

55:26.625 --> 55:28.500
Just so you know, this is medicinal.

55:28.583 --> 55:30.541
-Cheers.
-Oh, yeah. That old chestnut.

55:30.625 --> 55:31.625
-[MJ laughing]
-Ah...

55:31.708 --> 55:33.500
-Cheers, Mom.
-Cardiologist approved.

55:33.583 --> 55:34.958
-[Jack] Mmm.
-[Russ clears throat]

55:35.041 --> 55:36.583
Oh, that's good.

55:39.375 --> 55:41.083
-It's great to have you back.
-Yeah.

55:46.291 --> 55:47.416
[door opens]

55:49.375 --> 55:50.791
Oh. MJ.

55:50.875 --> 55:51.875
Hi.

55:51.958 --> 55:54.125
[stifled sobs]

55:55.708 --> 55:58.041
MJ. Are you okay?

55:58.125 --> 55:59.500
[crying] Yeah.

55:59.583 --> 56:00.958
I'm-- Yeah, I'm fine.

56:01.041 --> 56:02.458
[clears throat] I'm fine.

56:03.250 --> 56:04.458
You know what? This is my fault.

56:04.541 --> 56:06.583
I should not have come.
Russ just said that--

56:06.666 --> 56:08.041
Oh, screw Russ!

56:08.125 --> 56:09.250
What?

56:09.333 --> 56:13.375
Look, I lost something
in all of this, too.

56:13.458 --> 56:16.708
I-I miss you, I mean, a lot.

56:16.791 --> 56:19.500
I miss you, too, so much.

56:19.583 --> 56:21.208
So much.

56:21.291 --> 56:23.875
Thanksgiving was so depressing
without you.

56:23.958 --> 56:27.333
I mean, those two bozos, they barely talk,

56:27.416 --> 56:30.791
and when they do, it's traffic
or weather or what's for lunch.

56:30.875 --> 56:32.666
It is like being with two cavemen.

56:32.750 --> 56:34.333
I miss our talks so much.

56:34.416 --> 56:36.958
Me, too! Oh, me, too.

56:37.041 --> 56:38.875
-And you know what?
-What?

56:38.958 --> 56:40.750
-Your bangs are so cute.
-Thank you.

56:40.833 --> 56:42.416
-I mean, they're fantastic.
-Thank you.

56:42.500 --> 56:44.958
I just said that to be mean. I'm sorry.

56:45.041 --> 56:47.125
-It's okay. I know. I know you did.
-Okay?

56:49.208 --> 56:50.375
[both sigh]

56:50.458 --> 56:51.875
But thank you for saying that.

56:51.958 --> 56:53.958
-Okay.
-I just have one thing to say.

56:54.041 --> 56:55.958
-Mm-hmm? Yes?
-If you're gonna unblock me,

56:56.041 --> 56:58.041
can we talk about some of the stuff
you've been posting?

56:58.125 --> 56:59.708
Oh, you're gonna hate what I just said.

56:59.791 --> 57:00.791
[laughter]

57:00.875 --> 57:04.125
Every day, Mr. De Lorenzo gets out
his power washer,

57:04.208 --> 57:07.208
and he's power-washing the fence
and he's power-washing,

57:07.291 --> 57:09.000
-like, his lounge chairs.
-[Jack and Russ laughing]

57:09.083 --> 57:13.166
Any random piece of crap
that he can get, power-washes.

57:13.250 --> 57:14.375
Well, why don't you just
say something to him?

57:14.458 --> 57:16.125
Oh, oh, she's said plenty.

57:16.208 --> 57:17.208
[Russ and MJ laughing]

57:17.291 --> 57:21.291
If it ever gets so bad
that I am power-washing

57:21.375 --> 57:23.916
all our furniture to pass the time,

57:24.000 --> 57:25.250
just put me in the street.

57:25.333 --> 57:28.666
Put my body out there, let the birds
pluck my eyes out like Tippi Hedren.

57:28.750 --> 57:30.333
-I'm begging you.
-[Russ laughs]

57:30.416 --> 57:33.875
So, Anna, I forgot to tell you, you're in
the room across from the bathroom.

57:33.958 --> 57:35.958
Oh, no, Mom,
we're gonna drive back out tonight.

57:36.041 --> 57:37.291
-No.
-Over our dead bodies, you are.

57:37.375 --> 57:39.833
Come on, Dad. You know Mom
doesn't want Merv staying here.

57:39.916 --> 57:41.708
People change.

57:42.416 --> 57:43.708
-Really?
-[MJ] Mm-hmm.

57:45.583 --> 57:47.666
Thank you. That would be really nice.

57:47.750 --> 57:49.458
Okay! Oh, good.

57:49.541 --> 57:51.583
We can do movie night.
It will be just like old times.

57:51.666 --> 57:53.000
[Jack] Mm. We get to pick, though.

01:29:33.166 --> 01:29:34.208
Go fetch.

01:29:35.541 --> 01:29:36.875
Are you ready...

01:29:36.958 --> 01:29:39.416
for the one, the only...

01:29:39.500 --> 01:29:42.125
Mr. Bear! Yay!

01:29:42.208 --> 01:29:43.416
-Go.
-[toy squeaks]

01:29:43.500 --> 01:29:45.583
Go get it. Go get it.

01:29:45.666 --> 01:29:46.916
Yes. Yes.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:48.083
No.

01:29:48.166 --> 01:29:50.416
-No! [sighs]
-[barks]

01:29:50.500 --> 01:29:51.791
It's almost Christmas.

01:29:51.875 --> 01:29:53.416
I think it's okay.

01:29:54.541 --> 01:29:55.541
Go.

01:29:59.208 --> 01:30:01.208
[uplifting music playing]

01:30:03.500 --> 01:30:05.750
Aw, Merv.

01:30:05.833 --> 01:30:07.916
[chuckles] It's you.

01:30:08.791 --> 01:30:10.333
Look how cute.

01:30:13.500 --> 01:30:14.541
Let's see what I got.

01:30:21.250 --> 01:30:24.416
[Russ] What's up?
Don't tell me you're lonely as well.

01:30:24.500 --> 01:30:27.791
Are you missing your friends
at the dog shelter?

01:30:27.875 --> 01:30:29.333
Don't want to play fetch.

01:30:29.416 --> 01:30:30.833
You don't want cuddles.

01:30:30.916 --> 01:30:32.500
You've barely eaten your food.

01:30:33.708 --> 01:30:37.083
I don't think you're gonna want
any of the super-gloop.

01:30:37.166 --> 01:30:38.750
-[whines]
-Really?

01:30:38.833 --> 01:30:41.583
[whining]

01:30:41.666 --> 01:30:42.833

[barks]

01:30:44.541 --> 01:30:46.250
Okay, here you go.

01:30:46.333 --> 01:30:48.875
It's your funeral. [sighs]

[uplifting music playing]

01:30:53.375 --> 01:30:55.208
[laughs] No way.

"Merv, if you're feeling crappy,
eat your greens.

01:31:04.375 --> 01:31:06.125

-Are those baguettes?
-[Carly] Yeah.

01:31:24.041 --> 01:31:26.000
I buttered your bread.

[indistinct chatter continues on TV]

01:31:34.375 --> 01:31:35.833
[whispering] She snores so loud.

01:31:35.916 --> 01:31:37.875
[chuckling] Yeah, she does.

01:31:37.958 --> 01:31:39.083
Who snores like that?

01:31:39.833 --> 01:31:41.333
Come for Christmas with us.

01:31:42.375 --> 01:31:44.750
-What? Christmas? What? No.
-Yeah. Come on.

01:31:44.833 --> 01:31:46.833
D-Desmond... [clears throat]

01:31:46.916 --> 01:31:48.541
probably won't burn the turkey again.

01:31:48.625 --> 01:31:52.708
No. Last time I came for dinner,
Desmond burned peas, okay? Peas.

01:31:52.791 --> 01:31:53.875
[Rebekah chuckling]

01:31:53.958 --> 01:31:56.791
Look, you don't have to take pity on me.

01:31:56.875 --> 01:31:58.083
Okay? I'm fine.

01:31:58.166 --> 01:32:00.625
-No, you're not.
-No--

01:32:00.708 --> 01:32:02.750
But you're gonna be on your own
at Christmas.

01:32:02.833 --> 01:32:04.166
It's a really lovely offer.

01:32:04.250 --> 01:32:06.041
-I really appreciate it, but I--
-Please.

01:32:06.125 --> 01:32:08.041
-I'm--
-It'll be nice.

01:32:08.125 --> 01:32:10.625
I would've loved to have come. I just...

01:32:13.250 --> 01:32:14.875
Okay.

01:32:14.958 --> 01:32:16.833
Okay. Um...

-I will come.

And if-if you want me to watch the kids

01:32:24.208 --> 01:32:28.333
while Desmond burns the turkey, I...

01:32:29.833 --> 01:32:31.166
I can do that.

01:32:31.250 --> 01:32:34.750
[squeals] This might be
my favorite Christmas gift ever.

01:32:34.833 --> 01:32:36.708
Thank you.

You've got to pee. Come on, please.

[voice shaking] Please.

01:32:49.083 --> 01:32:50.166
For me?

01:32:50.250 --> 01:32:52.833
[grumbling]

01:32:52.916 --> 01:32:54.458
I'm putting my foot down.

01:32:54.541 --> 01:32:56.250
We have to go pee.

01:32:56.333 --> 01:32:57.333
We're gonna pee.

01:33:06.250 --> 01:33:07.625
See?

01:33:07.708 --> 01:33:09.541
I told you the park was a good idea.

01:33:09.625 --> 01:33:11.708
This was Merv's favorite park.

01:33:11.791 --> 01:33:13.333
What do you say we get a snack, huh?

01:33:13.416 --> 01:33:14.625
-You like pretzels?
-[yelps softly]

01:33:15.708 --> 01:33:17.458
Good. Me, too. Here, come here.

Right. Let's try you off leash, okay?
Sit down.

-Perfect. Let's go.
-[barks]

01:33:29.625 --> 01:33:31.333

-Angelina, stop! Stop right now!

Oh, my goodness.

You crazy pup,
you can't go running off like that, eh?

01:34:00.166 --> 01:34:02.541
Come on. Oh, my goodness, that's enough.

-Hi.
-What are you doing here?

I'm walking my dog, actually.

You, um, got glasses.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.458
I did get glasses. Yes.

01:34:52.541 --> 01:34:54.541
Turns out I have really poor eyesight.

01:34:54.625 --> 01:34:57.708
I'm surprised you didn't encourage me
to get them checked at any point.

01:34:58.875 --> 01:35:01.000
It looks really good. It-it suits you.

01:35:01.083 --> 01:35:02.875
-You think?
-Mm-hmm.

I'm gonna regret it if I don't tell--

[voice breaking] I miss you so much,
like, every day.

01:36:24.458 --> 01:36:25.666
-Really?
-Yeah.

01:36:25.750 --> 01:36:29.208
[chuckles] See, I-I-I thought
that I could live without you

01:36:29.291 --> 01:36:31.708
and that it was the right thing for us.

01:36:31.791 --> 01:36:33.375
It's not better. It's horrible.

01:36:33.458 --> 01:36:35.791
-It's the worst.
-The worst.

01:36:35.875 --> 01:36:39.541
And I really thought, like, if I got my
life together and I sorted my shit out--

01:36:39.625 --> 01:36:41.416
And even now that I've done that, I--

01:36:41.500 --> 01:36:42.916
-And still, it's--
-You did that?

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.291
Oh, yeah. I did. I have drawer dividers.

-Yeah.
-Who are you?

I don't know.

01:36:53.583 --> 01:36:56.125
Well, turns out you were right.

01:36:56.208 --> 01:36:58.166
Life's just more fun with you in it.

01:36:58.250 --> 01:36:59.583
I told you.

01:36:59.666 --> 01:37:00.791
And you know what?

01:37:00.875 --> 01:37:03.291
I don't want our band
to be called The Mistakes.

01:37:03.375 --> 01:37:04.541
-I don't.
-I don't.

01:37:04.625 --> 01:37:06.166
How about, like...

-The Forevers?
-[gasps]

01:37:08.208 --> 01:37:10.291
-It's so cheesy.
-[laughs]

01:37:10.375 --> 01:37:12.208
-But we can workshop it.
-Okay.

01:38:09.500 --> 01:38:11.875
You'll get one before you know it,
Angelina.

01:38:11.958 --> 01:38:13.375
[Russ] That's right.
You don't worry about it.

01:38:13.458 --> 01:38:15.333
[Anna] You don't worry.

01:38:17.166 --> 01:38:18.708
-[Russ] So, this band...
-[Anna] Yeah.

01:38:18.791 --> 01:38:21.666
I think I should be the lead guitarist
'cause now I play guitar.

01:38:21.750 --> 01:38:23.875
