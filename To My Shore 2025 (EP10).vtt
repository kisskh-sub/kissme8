00:00:12.159 --> 00:00:17.479
A wind that only seems gentle

00:00:17.959 --> 00:00:22.440
Your gaze shimmers with a dark undertow

00:00:23.479 --> 00:00:28.120
Who is laughing at my madness

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:33.560
yet indulges my startled heart

00:00:34.759 --> 00:00:38.959
I see through your mask

00:00:39.959 --> 00:00:44.159
and let you probe my limits

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.759
It is I who indulge

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:51.400
Love blazes like fire

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:55.840
spreading

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.880
Hard to say who crossed the line first

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.759
and who is waiting for whom to yield

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:04.599
Sharing rouge-scented smoke

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:07.639
and the flame that collides at our lips

00:01:07.639 --> 00:01:10.000
fiercer than any tender lingering

00:01:10.239 --> 00:01:12.839
a duel that stakes our pride

00:01:12.839 --> 00:01:18.080
whether a calamity decreed by fate

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:23.319
or sweetness bestowed by heaven

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.639
I still choose craving, wrath, and folly's

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:30.279
mad notion

00:01:30.279 --> 00:01:33.400
made real

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:40.720
To hold your gaze is far too perilous

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.839
I walk devoutly toward my ruin

00:01:46.839 --> 00:01:56.199
You are my abyss

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:03.919
You are my

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:08.479
sunshine

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.000
"To My Shore"

00:02:16.279 --> 00:02:17.479
Professor Huang.

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:20.000
What's the deal with the investor?

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.160
I still know nothing.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:23.880
You just arrived.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.800
Your to-do list is a mile long.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.679
Investors are just money men.

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:32.960
No need to study them.

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:34.399
Anyway,

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:35.679
They'll be here in a minute.

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:37.080
We'll talk as we meet them.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.360
President Huang.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.600
Your guests are here, Mr. Huang.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:41.600
Please.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.279
President Fan.

00:03:11.279 --> 00:03:12.960
Sorry for not greeting you sooner.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.039
Shulang.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.360
President Fan

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:19.160
I don't need to introduce you again, do I?

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.000
No need.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.520
President Fan.

00:03:29.279 --> 00:03:31.119
Long time no see, Director You.

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:38.160
Earlier, President Fan said.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.679
You two had some misunderstandings.

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:41.639
He was worried it might affect your joining us.

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:43.199
He didn't want me to tell you.

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:46.320
He's the investor backing our honeysuckle drink project.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.559
He made me worry.

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:51.320
He thought you two might clash when you met.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.919
Looks like I overthought it.

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:58.399
You young people...

00:03:58.639 --> 00:03:59.960
you're so impulsive.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.160
No matter the differences before,

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.839
it's all in the past now.

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:05.839
Don't dwell on it.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.720
Before, I overstepped.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.479
I offended Director You.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.359
And I hope Director You won't hold it against me.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.600
Of course not.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.040
You're overthinking, President Fan.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.959
How could you ever overstep?

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.839
Everyone, please take your seats.

00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:30.760
The meeting will begin soon.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.160
Good.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.160
Let's break for intermission.

00:05:07.679 --> 00:05:08.480
Sir

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.559
I'm going to the restroom.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:10.559
Okay.

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:54.040
Wait for me.

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.079
I'm waiting for you.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.239
Director You looks good in a lab coat.

00:06:02.679 --> 00:06:03.679
Fan Xiao.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.399
Are you trying to control my life?

00:06:07.399 --> 00:06:09.200
Why would you say that?

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.399
Lend me a light.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:26.760
Sorry.

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.079
The light's been extinguished.

00:06:31.119 --> 00:06:32.880
Did the last beating hurt?

00:06:33.079 --> 00:06:34.000
It did.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.920
I was in bed for half a month.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.600
I took my work to the hospital every day.

00:06:42.679 --> 00:06:44.679
Then why are you here?

00:06:45.992 --> 00:06:47.472
Looking for revenge?

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.359
Not revenge, Shulang.

00:06:49.399 --> 00:06:51.119
Maybe there's a misunderstanding between us.

00:06:54.359 --> 00:06:55.920
After everything,

00:06:56.519 --> 00:06:58.119
you're still making things up?

00:06:58.119 --> 00:06:59.640
Still lying?

00:07:00.559 --> 00:07:01.959
It's all my doing.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.239
I admit it.

00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:04.320
But I can explain.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.959
What's your explanation?

00:07:06.959 --> 00:07:08.519
Using Professor Huang,

00:07:08.519 --> 00:07:10.600
tricking me into Changling Pharma.

00:07:11.119 --> 00:07:12.679
to continue controlling me.

00:07:14.679 --> 00:07:17.880
Let me think about why you
would do something like that.

00:07:18.483 --> 00:07:20.839
Bohai is a pharmaceutical company, after all.

00:07:21.116 --> 00:07:22.799
With your ability, Fan Xiao,

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.760
you couldn't fully get your hands around it.

00:07:26.559 --> 00:07:27.920
But Changling is different.

00:07:27.959 --> 00:07:30.000
It's just a research team.

00:07:30.559 --> 00:07:32.119
No money,

00:07:32.119 --> 00:07:33.359
no people,

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.279
no ability to push back.

00:07:37.317 --> 00:07:39.799
Where you can do whatever you want, right?

00:07:43.079 --> 00:07:44.160
Fan Xiao.

00:07:45.239 --> 00:07:48.000
You don't want to control Changling Pharma,

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:50.200
You want to control me.

00:07:51.119 --> 00:07:53.959
Am I really that useless in your eyes?

00:07:55.799 --> 00:07:57.239
Without Bohai,

00:07:57.839 --> 00:07:59.320
without Changling,

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:02.880
am I allowed to keep living?

00:08:03.559 --> 00:08:05.000
Leaving Changling.

00:08:05.359 --> 00:08:07.239
Wasn't this your ideal job?

00:08:07.239 --> 00:08:08.000
Didn't you tell me.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.320
You wanted to return to front-line R&amp;D?

00:08:11.119 --> 00:08:13.760
Yes, I want to work in a research team again.

00:08:15.079 --> 00:08:17.559
But I'd rather give up that dream,

00:08:18.239 --> 00:08:20.200
than see you again.

00:08:25.079 --> 00:08:26.600
Not even “see”—

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.559
Even thinking of you.

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:34.440
I feel disgusted.

00:08:35.599 --> 00:08:38.200
Please get out of my life.

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:41.599
Go far away.

00:08:43.719 --> 00:08:45.280
You can leave Changling,

00:08:47.159 --> 00:08:48.520
But if you do,

00:08:49.359 --> 00:08:52.080
Changling will mean nothing to me.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.479
It has no reason to exist anymore.

00:08:59.039 --> 00:09:00.320
What do you mean?

00:09:00.559 --> 00:09:01.880
My meaning is.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.679
If you leave Changling,

00:09:04.119 --> 00:09:05.559
and you leave me,

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.440
then Professor Huang's decades of effort...

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.280
will go up in smoke.

00:09:13.799 --> 00:09:15.159
What a joke.

00:09:15.599 --> 00:09:17.400
Even if you pull funding,

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.919
can't Changling find another investor?

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:24.400
Why don't you.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:28.000
go back and check the contract with Mr. Huang.

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:31.919
If you don't complete the process optimization
within twenty days,

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:36.119
then it'll be considered a unilateral breach of
contract, and there'll need to be compensation.

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:44.239
I think your Professor Huang wouldn't even
be able to pay for all of Changling Pharma.

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:45.880
Twenty days?

00:09:47.479 --> 00:09:49.919
How could we complete the
process optimization in twenty days?

00:09:50.159 --> 00:09:52.479
How could he sign
such an absurd contract?

00:09:53.119 --> 00:10:02.200
All I did was tell your teacher how my father
needs a good contract to support me in Bangkok.

00:10:03.119 --> 00:10:04.200
Of course.

00:10:04.919 --> 00:10:06.520
I promised him.

00:10:07.239 --> 00:10:09.280
No matter what the contract said,

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:12.760
I would give him six months of R&amp;D time.

00:10:17.159 --> 00:10:20.159
Don't blame me for “tricking” your teacher.

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:24.239
If he hadn't wanted to keep me,

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:26.880
he wouldn't have taken that risk.

00:10:28.359 --> 00:10:29.359
So.

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.799
If you leave Changling,

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:34.320
Changling really will be finished.

00:10:34.479 --> 00:10:36.520
Do you think I care if Changling lives or dies?

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:37.559
You will.

00:10:37.559 --> 00:10:41.559
If you didn't, you should've blown
everything up when you saw me earlier.

00:10:46.919 --> 00:10:48.880
You care about others' lives,

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.280
but you don't care about mine.

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.479
You never wanted to care about mine.

00:10:58.599 --> 00:11:00.960
You used to play in the shadows,

00:11:02.359 --> 00:11:05.919
now you're doing it in broad daylight.

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:25.039
Whatever you
say, that's what it is.

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:36.800
(Episode 10)

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.080
Other investment firms?

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.159
They either said the project has no prospects

00:11:45.479 --> 00:11:47.719
or they tried to put us down.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:51.039
Pinfeng gave us the best offer.

00:11:51.679 --> 00:11:54.840
Their marketing plan is ideal.

00:11:55.119 --> 00:11:56.719
Although in the contract,

00:11:56.719 --> 00:11:58.719
it only says twenty days.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.520
But if they really fall out over this,

00:12:02.799 --> 00:12:07.280
then their investment will
have gone down the drain.

00:12:16.359 --> 00:12:18.479
If they push me too far,

00:12:18.799 --> 00:12:21.479
I'll just hand over whatever's been done.

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:23.559
Anyway,

00:12:23.559 --> 00:12:25.159
Don't expect me to pay.

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.640
If it really comes to that,

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:32.799
my life's work will be in vain.

00:12:37.239 --> 00:12:38.320
Professor Huang

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.840
I'll do everything I can to
finish these things for you.

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.559
And then I'm leaving Changling.

00:13:58.719 --> 00:13:59.880
A bit skinny.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.080
Pale.

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:03.359
Clear and white skin.

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:05.200
Loves to flirt.

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:15.719
Bro, you called for someone?

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:16.880
Come in.

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:43.640
Want a drink?

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:46.479
Do you want to drink now?

00:14:46.479 --> 00:14:48.760
I like drinking in bed.

00:14:50.919 --> 00:14:53.080
Then I'll accompany you to drink in bed.

00:14:53.479 --> 00:14:54.320
Bro

00:14:54.479 --> 00:14:56.159
I already showered.

00:14:57.159 --> 00:14:57.919
Good.

00:14:58.159 --> 00:14:59.520
Wait for me on the bed.

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:57.799
Why not keep watching the show?

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:01.080
Don't you love surveilling people's lives?

00:16:07.239 --> 00:16:10.840
That angle is clear.

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:11.799
Not bad.

00:16:11.799 --> 00:16:13.559
Quite the set up.

00:16:14.679 --> 00:16:16.840
How many cameras are in this apartment?

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:19.719
Still not leaving?

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:23.000
Don't be scared.

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:25.119
No one can hurt you.

00:16:32.799 --> 00:16:33.919
Thanks for your hard work.

00:16:35.239 --> 00:16:36.320
Then I'll leave.

00:16:36.479 --> 00:16:38.400
Do you need me to call the cops?

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:40.200
No need.

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.320
Take it slow on your way out.

00:16:49.239 --> 00:16:52.599
I didn't expect someone like Director You,
someone so pure and gentle,

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:55.640
to hire an escort.

00:17:00.039 --> 00:17:01.919
Only after trying did I realize.

00:17:03.039 --> 00:17:04.800
I still prefer this.

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:06.040
"This"

00:17:07.119 --> 00:17:08.839
means you on top of him,

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:11.119
Or him on top of you?

00:17:11.319 --> 00:17:13.400
- Can he satisfy you?
- Fan Xiao.

00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:18.719
You've made me regret all
the kindness I've shown to you.

00:17:18.719 --> 00:17:19.839
Because...

00:17:21.239 --> 00:17:23.239
you never deserved it.

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:25.839
Did I say something wrong?

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:27.800
Director You.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:36.239
Aren't you someone who now only feels
satisfied when someone's on top of you?

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:53.719
Aren't you someone who now only feels
satisfied when someone's on top of you?

00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:01.160
It's him—it's him.

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:02.680
Bastard—he's the one.

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:04.560
An abandoned child with no guidance.

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:05.599
Bastard.

00:18:05.599 --> 00:18:06.280
Stay away from him.

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:07.880
What if he corrupts our family?

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:10.280
I heard he's a stray, abandoned at birth.

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:12.119
No wonder they tossed him out as soon as he was born.

00:18:12.119 --> 00:18:13.839
Perverted, disgusting spawn.

00:18:13.839 --> 00:18:14.959
Unwanted bastard.

00:18:14.959 --> 00:18:16.400
I'm not unwanted.

00:18:16.439 --> 00:18:17.319
Pervert.
No.

00:18:18.199 --> 00:18:19.040
I'm not a pervert.

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:20.359
Pervert, get out.

00:18:20.359 --> 00:18:21.400
Unwanted bastard.

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:22.599
I'm not a pervert.

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:24.359
Get out now.
I'm not unwanted.

00:18:25.319 --> 00:18:26.680
Did your parents not teach you?

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:27.560
Everyone, get out.
Leave now.

00:18:28.199 --> 00:18:29.400
Leave, all of you.

00:18:29.599 --> 00:18:31.319
Leave, please.

00:18:40.359 --> 00:18:41.560
You Shulang.

00:18:42.199 --> 00:18:43.479
I love you.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.760
Take it off quickly.

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.920
I'll accept it even if you're straight.

00:18:56.439 --> 00:18:58.680
Still couldn't escape desire.

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.319
Still reduced to a plaything.

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:05.599
In the end,

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:07.880
Empty, nothing left.

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:09.839
Oh no.

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:13.119
You got deceived and hurt.

00:19:13.199 --> 00:19:15.599
And your body is ran through.

00:19:17.239 --> 00:19:18.479
You Shulang.

00:19:19.719 --> 00:19:24.199
Your life is a joke.

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:25.560
No.

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:27.839
No.

00:19:28.199 --> 00:19:30.000
It's not like that.

00:19:37.319 --> 00:19:43.239
Aren't you someone who now only feels
satisfied when someone's on top of you?

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.319
It's not like this, Fan Xiao.

00:19:45.319 --> 00:19:46.280
You.

00:19:47.479 --> 00:19:48.719
Fan Xiao, you...

00:19:48.719 --> 00:19:49.599
Yes.

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:50.640
In these houses,

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:52.280
I've installed cameras in every corner.

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:53.479
Including the bathroom.

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:56.839
I can see everything you do.

00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:58.959
You Shulang.

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:04.439
Just going from the front
can't satisfy you anymore, right?

00:20:10.359 --> 00:20:11.760
Congratulations.

00:20:12.479 --> 00:20:13.800
President Fan.

00:20:14.199 --> 00:20:17.280
Another R-rated video on your computer.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.319
Clear enough?

00:20:23.359 --> 00:20:25.040
If not clear,

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:30.280
Should I give you a live demonstration?

00:20:31.359 --> 00:20:32.280
Shulang.

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:37.640
Do you need it?

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:42.239
If not,

00:20:44.119 --> 00:20:46.079
Please leave.

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:08.160
I'm tired today.

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:09.439
I'll move tomorrow.

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:12.560
I don't mind being spied on for another night.

00:21:20.479 --> 00:21:22.680
I'll go to Changling tomorrow to resign.

00:21:23.199 --> 00:21:25.280
Do whatever you want.

00:21:26.199 --> 00:21:29.439
Everyone must pay for their actions.

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.479
Including me.

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:33.680
And including Professor Huang.

00:21:34.479 --> 00:21:35.719
Of course.

00:21:36.359 --> 00:21:38.000
And including you.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.000
Fan Xiao.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.119
If you give up Changling,

00:21:40.119 --> 00:21:41.839
and give up your teacher,

00:21:44.119 --> 00:21:45.839
I'm not responsible for that.

00:21:45.959 --> 00:21:47.400
All of this.

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.000
is none of my business.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.800
Though until now,

00:21:50.839 --> 00:21:54.880
I still don't know why you bear
so much malice towards me.

00:21:56.479 --> 00:21:57.800
But it doesn't matter.

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:00.040
It's not important anymore.

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:03.199
Please leave.

00:22:03.239 --> 00:22:04.319
President Fan.

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:07.359
Nothing matters anymore.

00:22:08.479 --> 00:22:10.400
Among all of this,

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:12.520
Does that include me?

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:13.640
Fan Xiao.

00:22:14.199 --> 00:22:17.079
I don't have time for word games with you.

00:22:18.439 --> 00:22:20.520
Either you leave on your own,

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:23.199
Or I'll make you leave.

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:27.160
I really don't feel like beating you up right now.

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:30.040
So please, President Fan, do me a favor.

00:22:31.359 --> 00:22:33.479
Leave on your own.

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:35.560
Looks like Director You.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.959
doesn't want to care about anyone now.

00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:48.479
Do you need me to take your place?

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:51.719
Should I ask how your brother's doing?

00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:58.839
What do you mean?

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.439
Nothing much.

00:23:02.439 --> 00:23:05.319
Just that your brother's in Thailand now,

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:08.000
as a personal financial advisor,

00:23:09.239 --> 00:23:11.119
working for me.

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:22.079
I'll turn off all the cameras.

00:23:24.445 --> 00:23:25.605
Director You.

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:30.680
You can sleep well tonight.

00:23:54.106 --> 00:23:54.547
Bro.

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:55.599
Where are you?

00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:56.719
Zhang Chen

00:23:56.719 --> 00:23:57.880
I'm here.

00:23:59.719 --> 00:24:00.199
Where are you?
Bro.

00:24:01.199 --> 00:24:02.359
Over here.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.199
It's the weekend.

00:24:09.239 --> 00:24:10.280
Was the traffic bad?

00:24:11.239 --> 00:24:12.359
I sold the car.

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:14.199
Took the bus.

00:24:18.119 --> 00:24:18.880
Bro.

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:22.119
Your favorite egg dumplings.

00:24:23.479 --> 00:24:24.599
Do you remember?

00:24:24.599 --> 00:24:25.359
When we were kids,

00:24:25.359 --> 00:24:27.359
Mom would light the coal fire to make egg dumplings.

00:24:27.359 --> 00:24:30.359
We would both crowd around
the stove, fighting to roast them.

00:24:30.359 --> 00:24:31.520
Now.

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:33.359
Many restaurants don't make them anymore.

00:24:33.359 --> 00:24:34.599
I looked for a long time,

00:24:34.599 --> 00:24:36.319
Before I found this restaurant.

00:24:37.119 --> 00:24:39.040
Back then, we couldn't afford good food.

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:39.479
Come on.

00:24:39.479 --> 00:24:41.839
Eating egg dumplings was like celebrating the New Year.

00:24:41.839 --> 00:24:42.760
Try some.

00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:44.400
Speaking of the New Year,

00:24:44.839 --> 00:24:45.800
Do you remember?

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:47.239
One time it snowed heavily.

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:51.160
Many shops on West Street were buried by the snow.

00:24:54.239 --> 00:24:55.119
Mom.

00:24:55.119 --> 00:24:56.839
Look what I brought back.

00:24:57.359 --> 00:24:58.959
Where did this roast chicken come from?

00:24:58.959 --> 00:25:00.119
I went to the farmers' market.

00:25:00.119 --> 00:25:01.160
They needed help carrying things.

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:03.079
I helped them, and they gave me this.

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:07.599
Your hand's injured.

00:25:07.599 --> 00:25:08.359
It's fine, Mom.

00:25:08.359 --> 00:25:10.199
Don't move, I'll get the medicine.

00:25:12.599 --> 00:25:13.119
Xiao Chen.

00:25:13.119 --> 00:25:14.560
Save a drumstick for your brother.

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:16.599
No need, Xiao Chen is growing.

00:25:16.599 --> 00:25:17.400
Leave it all for you.

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:18.880
My brother's the best to me.

00:25:19.119 --> 00:25:20.839
I love mom's egg dumplings the most.

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:22.319
You're just sweet-talking.

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:24.319
Back then,

00:25:24.319 --> 00:25:25.680
I thought it was so delicious.

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:27.119
Now,

00:25:27.119 --> 00:25:28.800
no matter what good food I eat,

00:25:28.839 --> 00:25:30.599
I don't feel the same anymore.

00:25:32.513 --> 00:25:34.352
Waiter, bring a bottle of the Ergoutou.

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:35.839
Here.

00:25:37.359 --> 00:25:38.239
Bro.

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:42.479
If I remember correctly, you
don't seem to drink much baijiu.

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:46.839
I'll do it myself.

00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:51.280
Come on.

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:52.439
I'll drink with you.

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:54.959
Bro.

00:25:56.199 --> 00:25:57.160
I'm following your lead.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:05.959
Xiao Chen.

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:08.079
Why did you come out to meet me today?

00:26:11.719 --> 00:26:12.640
Bro.

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:13.760
You know,

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:15.640
I'm working for President Fan, right?

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:23.239
I heard you had a falling out with him?

00:26:27.119 --> 00:26:28.119
Xiao Chen.

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:29.400
Tell me,

00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:33.640
why did Fan Xiao give you such a high-paying job?

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:39.599
You mean,

00:26:39.719 --> 00:26:41.400
I'm riding your coattails?

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:42.599
Not “coattails.”

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:43.839
Xiao Chen.

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:46.520
Fan Xiao isn't a good person.

00:26:46.599 --> 00:26:49.920
I advise you to quit this job as soon as possible.

00:26:50.119 --> 00:26:52.959
I know he's not a good person.

00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:58.880
This scar is because of him.

00:26:58.880 --> 00:26:59.640
No.

00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:01.359
It's from a cigarette burn.

00:27:01.439 --> 00:27:02.280
It's fine.

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:04.119
Even if he treated me like this,

00:27:04.239 --> 00:27:06.680
I don't mind working for him.

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:09.079
So, bro,

00:27:09.439 --> 00:27:11.319
Can you be a bit more mature?

00:27:11.439 --> 00:27:13.119
Why butt heads with him?

00:27:13.119 --> 00:27:15.079
Do you know how rich he is?

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:19.319
So,

00:27:21.839 --> 00:27:24.920
You're here to talk me into going back to Fan Xiao?

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:25.560
Bro.

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:28.040
You haven't had enough of being poor?

00:27:31.359 --> 00:27:33.520
With a sucker like President Fan right in front of us,

00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:34.359
the two of us,

00:27:34.359 --> 00:27:36.520
if we team up, we'll definitely make a lot off him.

00:27:37.479 --> 00:27:39.160
You still want to grab other people's money?

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:41.160
Haven't you learned from the last time?

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:43.319
No,

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:46.560
It's different now.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.239
You and Fan Xiao have that kind of relationship,

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:51.839
As long as you coax him,

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:52.880
and get him to hand over his money,

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:55.079
and for him to trust me to invest it,

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:58.000
Then we'll figure out how to get the money later.

00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:00.640
Zhang Chen.

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:04.400
You underestimate Fan Xiao.

00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:06.199
You're underestimating me too.

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:08.400
Here's my final piece of advice:

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.119
Stay away from Fan Xiao.

00:28:10.119 --> 00:28:11.560
Leave the country and go back now.

00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:14.319
This person isn't as simple
as he appears on the surface.

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:15.719
He can't be manipulated by you.

00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:20.400
Also, you have no idea how
bad and vicious this man can be.

00:28:25.359 --> 00:28:26.160
Xiao Chen

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:27.920
I hope you'll settle down,

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:29.439
and find a real job.

00:28:29.439 --> 00:28:32.199
Stop always thinking about shortcuts to quick money.

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:34.199
Our mom's death anniversary is in a few days.

00:28:34.319 --> 00:28:35.880
I'll go back with you.

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:37.079
Let's visit her.

00:28:39.239 --> 00:28:40.160
You Shulang.

00:28:40.239 --> 00:28:41.479
You think you're so precious?

00:28:41.479 --> 00:28:42.959
Who you sleep with doesn't matter.

00:28:42.959 --> 00:28:45.400
All those years of schooling,
all for naught.

00:28:46.719 --> 00:28:48.119
This young man.

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:49.119
What's he doing?

00:28:49.119 --> 00:28:51.680
Why does everything they say sound so open-minded?

00:28:58.359 --> 00:28:59.359
Bro.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.479
What I just said.

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:05.199
was the truth.

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:12.680
Men in relationships like this,
don't need to get married, right?

00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:14.839
Who you live with is fine, right?

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:16.479
Mr. Fan.

00:29:16.839 --> 00:29:17.959
He's handsome.

00:29:17.959 --> 00:29:19.239
He's rich.

00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:21.400
What else do you have to complain about?

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:25.959
Bro.

00:29:27.319 --> 00:29:30.800
Even if you really can't get along with him,

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:32.520
For my sake,

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:34.040
tolerate him for me.

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:38.199
You know the job market right now is terrible.

00:29:38.199 --> 00:29:40.839
It wasn't easy at all to
find such a high-paying job.

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:42.560
Let me stay for a year.

00:29:43.239 --> 00:29:44.760
By then,

00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:47.479
I'll have a good résumé.

00:29:48.359 --> 00:29:49.400
And also,

00:29:49.439 --> 00:29:52.680
he still has the evidence of my incident.

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:54.640
Last time, Fan Xiao threatened me.

00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:57.199
If you don't get along with him,

00:29:57.479 --> 00:29:59.319
Then I'm finished.

00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:03.880
Bro.

00:30:04.719 --> 00:30:05.520
Bro.

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:08.560
Bro.

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:11.400
Bro.

00:30:11.719 --> 00:30:13.359
For mom's sake,

00:30:13.359 --> 00:30:15.000
please help me.

00:30:16.439 --> 00:30:19.079
If this thing gets exposed,

00:30:19.199 --> 00:30:21.800
I won't be able to survive in this industry.

00:30:23.079 --> 00:30:27.400
And by that point, Mom will never
be able to find peace in the afterlife.

00:30:40.119 --> 00:30:41.040
Bro, you're the best.

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:44.520
Xiao Chen.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.760
When you have trouble in the future,

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:52.199
You can come find me.

00:30:55.626 --> 00:30:57.719
But this thing today,

00:30:58.679 --> 00:30:59.624
I'm sorry,

00:30:59.785 --> 00:31:00.118
No...

00:31:00.991 --> 00:31:02.839
I can't help you.

00:31:09.959 --> 00:31:10.760
No,
Bro.

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:13.280
You have to save me!

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:14.599
If you don't save me,

00:31:14.599 --> 00:31:16.040
I'll be dead.

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:16.880
Bro.

00:31:22.119 --> 00:31:24.079
Bro.

00:31:24.439 --> 00:31:25.800
You Shulang.

00:31:27.079 --> 00:31:29.000
Are you trying to drive me to the grave?

00:31:53.479 --> 00:31:54.599
Officer.

00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:58.000
You are You Shulang?

00:31:58.239 --> 00:31:59.199
Yes, officer.

00:31:59.199 --> 00:32:00.719
I'm his brother, You Shulang.

00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:02.359
He asked for you by name.

00:32:02.359 --> 00:32:03.920
Talk to him, calm him down.

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:05.359
Try to calm his emotions.

00:32:05.359 --> 00:32:07.280
We'll wait for the right moment to rescue him.

00:32:07.439 --> 00:32:10.000
Is he in danger of falling from here?

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.719
It's relatively safe as long as we don't provoke him.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.640
As long as we don't provoke him.

00:32:13.719 --> 00:32:16.040
If he's determined to die,

00:32:16.439 --> 00:32:17.719
no one can stop him.

00:32:18.199 --> 00:32:18.920
Okay.

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:20.359
Thank you, officer.

00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:26.719
You Shulang.

00:32:27.359 --> 00:32:29.319
Do you like what you see?
Are you satisfied now?

00:32:30.319 --> 00:32:31.359
Don't come any closer.

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:33.760
If you come any closer, I'll jump!

00:32:35.439 --> 00:32:36.520
Zhang Chen.

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:39.479
Come over here, and we'll talk.

00:32:39.479 --> 00:32:40.680
Let's talk calmly.

00:32:40.719 --> 00:32:42.359
I'm trying to talk to you calmly.

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:43.599
Why don't you pick up the phone?

00:32:43.599 --> 00:32:45.479
How many times have I
called you in the past few days?

00:32:45.479 --> 00:32:46.359
Zhang Chen.

00:32:47.119 --> 00:32:49.119
What benefits did Fan Xiao promise you?

00:32:49.414 --> 00:32:51.094
Is it worth selling your life for him?

00:32:51.119 --> 00:32:52.839
What benefits?

00:32:53.359 --> 00:32:55.119
What can I gain?

00:32:55.119 --> 00:32:56.920
Isn't it all up to you?

00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:58.119
You Shulang

00:32:58.119 --> 00:33:00.160
I really can't figure this out.

00:33:00.199 --> 00:33:01.839
Do you really hate Fan Xiao?

00:33:01.839 --> 00:33:03.760
Or do you just simply hate me?

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:04.800
Zhang Chen.

00:33:05.599 --> 00:33:07.880
With so many people in the rescue team,

00:33:08.199 --> 00:33:09.839
Let's skip the formalities.

00:33:09.839 --> 00:33:11.640
Just tell me clearly,

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:13.319
what do I need to do to make you happy?

00:33:13.319 --> 00:33:15.000
Don't you know what's going on?

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.599
Saying it out loud just ruins the fun.

00:33:17.599 --> 00:33:18.640
Zhang Chen.

00:33:19.199 --> 00:33:21.119
Even brothers settle accounts clearly.

00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:23.040
We're not even real brothers.

00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:24.800
Just tell me straight.

00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:27.959
What do I need to do to make you happy?

00:33:29.199 --> 00:33:31.400
I just want to keep my current job.

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:32.839
You mean,

00:33:32.839 --> 00:33:34.760
you want me to go back to Fan Xiao's side?

00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:36.079
Help you win him over?

00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:38.839
Have him hand over his assets to you?

00:33:38.839 --> 00:33:41.199
And let you make a fortune?

00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:42.680
Is that it?

00:33:43.359 --> 00:33:44.400
Zhang Chen

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:46.160
I don't have that much power.

00:33:46.439 --> 00:33:49.239
This is just a game Fan Xiao plays when he's bored.

00:33:50.119 --> 00:33:51.560
I'm just a toy.

00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:54.000
And you're just a tool in his game.

00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:57.439
Do you know why he's
still interested in this game?

00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:00.839
Because he wasn't the
one who ended things.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.599
Do you know how he plans to keep this game going?

00:34:04.239 --> 00:34:06.640
By finding my weak spot.

00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:12.159
Xiao Chen.

00:34:12.879 --> 00:34:14.120
Come back to our own country with me.

00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:15.639
I'm begging you, bro.

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:18.320
Bro.

00:34:23.679 --> 00:34:24.919
Don't come any closer.

00:34:25.959 --> 00:34:26.800
You Shulang.

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:28.479
I've finally found my golden calf.

00:34:28.775 --> 00:34:31.575
I've finally reached a place with no more hardships.

00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:33.439
And now you want me to leave?

00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:39.854
(Watch on www.dramacool.club Support Admin)

00:34:33.879 --> 00:34:34.560
I...

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:36.600
Zhang Chen.

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:37.800
Don't come closer.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.320
I'm starting to respect this You Shulang.

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:48.040
He isn't what other people seem to say,

00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:49.439
that he has no limits,

00:34:49.439 --> 00:34:50.919
or that he's a saintly figure of love.

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:54.520
It seems like he actually deserves better.

00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:56.199
What did you say?

00:34:58.439 --> 00:34:59.560
Nothing.

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:03.840
Such a good person should be squarely in your palm, Young Master Fan.

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:05.000
That's enough, right?

00:35:05.479 --> 00:35:07.399
You Shulang is just holding on.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.080
He's not as indifferent as he seems.

00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:13.239
I should have known advising
him to turn back was pointless.

00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:15.719
But he still didn't give up.

00:35:16.199 --> 00:35:19.159
You Shulang, are you really trying to drive me to death?

00:35:20.015 --> 00:35:21.654
Then should I die for you today?

00:35:21.679 --> 00:35:24.679
Do you know what will happen if I jump from here?

00:35:24.679 --> 00:35:27.120
You'll look terrible.

00:35:27.159 --> 00:35:28.760
If I don't jump.

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:30.439
will I look better?

00:35:30.439 --> 00:35:34.520
If that thing comes to light, he won't let me off if I go back.

00:35:37.479 --> 00:35:39.679
You Shulang, I beg you.

00:35:39.679 --> 00:35:42.399
For Mom, who saved and raised you.

00:35:42.399 --> 00:35:44.080
Help me just this once.

00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:45.080
If you...

00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:47.479
If you won't even give me this little bit of kindness,

00:35:49.159 --> 00:35:50.080
Then today...

00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:52.360
Today, I'll jump from here.

00:35:53.919 --> 00:35:56.120
Zhang Chen, will you jump or not?

00:35:56.399 --> 00:35:57.520
It's already quite late.

00:35:57.520 --> 00:35:59.879
You Shulang, is this even humane?

00:35:59.879 --> 00:36:01.919
Zhang Chen is trying to drive You Shulang to death.

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:05.840
Isn't it you who's trying to kill You Shulang?

00:36:06.639 --> 00:36:07.760
Xiao...

00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:10.800
This trick probably won't work.

00:36:10.919 --> 00:36:12.840
I didn't make Zhang Chen jump into the river.

00:36:13.679 --> 00:36:16.159
He's just a foolish person acting on his own.

00:36:16.159 --> 00:36:17.360
You didn't direct him, right?

00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:18.600
You Shulang,

00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:21.399
You still consider me your brother?

00:36:21.879 --> 00:36:23.479
That's surprising.

00:36:23.639 --> 00:36:26.479
Even with the river-jumping trick,
he still isn't moved.

00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:31.840
Looks like your Director You is really lost.

00:36:34.679 --> 00:36:38.040
You Shulang, my mom
really raised a white-eyed wolf.

00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:41.080
We should have left you to
freeze in the trash that winter.

00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:42.760
Goddamn you gays.

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:44.439
What's wrong with sleeping with men?

00:36:44.439 --> 00:36:46.239
You're still picky about who's on top?

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:49.000
Someone's willing to sleep with you?

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.919
Accompany you to do those disgusting things.

00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:53.040
You should be grateful!

00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:56.639
You go now.

00:36:56.639 --> 00:36:58.479
Things will just get worse.

00:36:58.600 --> 00:36:59.760
Just admit it.

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:02.320
Zhang Chen jumping into the river was your doing?

00:37:03.199 --> 00:37:04.399
You Shulang.

00:37:04.639 --> 00:37:06.919
Stop pretending to be so high and mighty.

00:37:07.199 --> 00:37:08.840
You don't want Fan Xiao's money?

00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:10.320
My dad was right.

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:12.959
You're just waiting for the right price.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.360
You're playing hard to get.

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:16.399
Trying to raise your own value?

00:37:16.479 --> 00:37:17.719
You've calculated every move.

00:37:17.719 --> 00:37:19.520
But you leave me no way out.

00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:21.239
Are you afraid I'll block your path?

00:37:21.239 --> 00:37:23.239
Or are you afraid I'll take your money?

00:37:23.239 --> 00:37:25.679
I was too kind to him last time.

00:37:26.719 --> 00:37:29.760
That cigarette should have burned his tongue.

00:37:31.399 --> 00:37:32.879
Zhang Chen.

00:37:32.879 --> 00:37:36.639
I've always wondered, why did
you suddenly become so greedy?

00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:40.423
Now that you're involved
with that man, it makes sense.

00:37:41.919 --> 00:37:43.840
You even call him “Dad” now.

00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:45.199
Zhang Chen.

00:37:45.639 --> 00:37:47.360
Did you forget all the suffering mom went through?

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:48.679
Wasn't it because of him?

00:37:48.679 --> 00:37:49.320
I...

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:50.879
He's a degenerate gambler.

00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:53.919
If he hadn't remarried and had no son,

00:37:53.919 --> 00:37:56.000
would he have given you such cheap fatherly love?

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.800
He gambled away his family.

00:37:58.399 --> 00:38:00.360
Do you want to follow in his footsteps?

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.840
So this timem, jumping into the river,

00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:05.879
Was it [him,] Wei Linming who put you up to this?

00:38:10.439 --> 00:38:11.639
That makes sense.

00:38:12.479 --> 00:38:14.439
He jumped once when he was young.

00:38:14.439 --> 00:38:16.000
He got a taste of the reward.

00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:19.080
So he encouraged you to do the same.

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:22.520
Zhang Chen, go ahead and jump.

00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:24.320
I won't stop you.

00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:26.159
You think I want to stand here?

00:38:26.199 --> 00:38:27.919
It's all because of you.

00:38:27.919 --> 00:38:28.959
Me and my dad.

00:38:28.959 --> 00:38:30.879
We were just short of a little bit of luck.

00:38:30.879 --> 00:38:32.199
Otherwise.

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:34.679
I wouldn't have to ask Fan Xiao for money.

00:38:34.919 --> 00:38:37.679
He only blackmailed me because of you.

00:38:37.919 --> 00:38:40.239
Now you're ruining my situation.

00:38:40.239 --> 00:38:41.879
You're trying to kill me.

00:38:41.879 --> 00:38:42.919
Zhang Chen.

00:38:44.239 --> 00:38:45.199
I broke my promise.

00:38:45.199 --> 00:38:47.639
Mom told me to take care of you before she passed.

00:38:48.159 --> 00:38:50.080
Sorry I didn't take good care of you.

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:51.679
And I'm even more sorry,

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:56.399
that I don't plan on taking care of you anymore.

00:38:56.399 --> 00:38:57.280
Zhang Chen.

00:38:59.199 --> 00:39:00.520
Take care of yourself.

00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:05.399
Bro.
Don't leave!

00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:07.399
What will I do if you leave?

00:39:07.399 --> 00:39:08.560
You can't just abandon me!

00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:09.959
Bro.

00:39:47.879 --> 00:39:48.959
Let go.

00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:54.879
Why save scum like him?

00:39:54.879 --> 00:39:56.719
Not afraid of putting your life at risk?

00:39:57.879 --> 00:40:00.239
What am I risking?

00:40:00.239 --> 00:40:02.080
It has nothing to do with you.

00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:03.679
This has nothing to do with me.

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:06.439
All of this is Zhang Chen's own idea.

00:40:06.879 --> 00:40:08.679
Can I be left alone for a bit?

00:40:08.679 --> 00:40:09.719
Shulang.

00:40:10.879 --> 00:40:11.919
Can I...?

00:40:11.919 --> 00:40:13.159
No.

00:40:13.159 --> 00:40:14.639
If you don't leave,

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:17.320
Then I'll leave.

00:40:18.639 --> 00:40:20.080
I've been wrong all along.

00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:21.760
You can punish me however you want.

00:40:21.879 --> 00:40:22.800
If you're still not satisfied,
Hit me again.

00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:24.879
As many times as you want.

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:28.679
I just ask for one more chance.

00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:31.120
Let's start over, okay?

00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:32.199
Go away.

00:40:32.919 --> 00:40:35.159
You want to know why I'm doing this to you, right?

00:40:35.719 --> 00:40:37.600
Let me explain to you, okay?

00:40:39.879 --> 00:40:41.120
It doesn't matter anymore.

00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:42.719
I don't want to know.

00:40:44.399 --> 00:40:45.679
I'm like Zhang Chen on the railing.

00:40:45.679 --> 00:40:47.679
You don't even want me, right?

00:40:51.879 --> 00:40:52.919
Shulang.

00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:55.560
I don't want to force you.

00:40:56.952 --> 00:40:58.912
How many times have you forced me?

00:41:00.679 --> 00:41:01.800
Move.

00:41:05.479 --> 00:41:07.760
Director You isn't answering his phone?

00:41:13.959 --> 00:41:16.159
Because of you, Fan Xiao.

00:41:17.719 --> 00:41:19.719
I lost my career.

00:41:20.239 --> 00:41:21.800
I lost my family.

00:41:21.879 --> 00:41:23.000
Now I'm alone.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.360
Nothing to my name.

00:41:24.639 --> 00:41:27.800
Even if I die, no one will even mourn me.

00:41:28.159 --> 00:41:29.919
I'm really curious.

00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:33.199
What else can you threaten me with?

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:40.760
Okay.

00:41:42.199 --> 00:41:43.159
I'll answer.

00:41:44.879 --> 00:41:45.760
Wait.

00:41:46.959 --> 00:41:48.000
Wait.

00:41:49.439 --> 00:41:51.159
I don't want to hurt you anymore.

00:41:52.679 --> 00:41:54.719
I don't want to corner myself either.

00:41:54.719 --> 00:41:55.800
Fan Xiao.

00:41:58.040 --> 00:41:59.959
I can ignore the call.

00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:02.040
You can take my phone too.

00:42:03.439 --> 00:42:06.439
But don't let me find out what you've done.

00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:08.760
This is the end.

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:12.000
Everything between us.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.280
Today.

00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:17.879
Clean slate.

00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:21.239
Clean slate.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.560
It's not that easy to have a clean slate.

00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:31.040
Answer the phone.

00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:32.120
Director You.

00:42:32.145 --> 00:42:32.874
(Bai Ting calling)

00:42:36.919 --> 00:42:37.919
Bai Ting.

00:42:37.959 --> 00:42:39.800
Brother You, they said...

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.560
They said they're taking me back.

00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:43.520
Save me, save me.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.600
Brother You, Brother You.

00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:46.760
Brother You, are you listening?

00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:48.479
Brother You, you said...

00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:52.560
Everyone has to pay for their mistakes.

00:42:52.959 --> 00:42:53.959
Mr. Huang.

00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:55.520
Zhang Chen.

00:42:55.959 --> 00:42:57.760
They've all done wrong.

00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:01.439
But Bai Ting hasn't done anything wrong.

00:43:01.439 --> 00:43:03.239
She only helped you out of kindness.

00:43:04.399 --> 00:43:05.360
Fan Xiao.

00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:07.360
You know she didn't do anything wrong.

00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:09.879
But you won't let her go?

00:43:10.479 --> 00:43:12.199
You're even using her.

00:43:12.199 --> 00:43:15.840
You can think of me...
as crazy.

00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:29.199
Fan Xiao.

00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:31.760
You won.

00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:39.879
I'm too tired.

00:43:55.199 --> 00:43:56.320
Fan Xiao.

00:43:57.840 --> 00:44:00.000
You handle Bai Ting's situation.

00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:01.639
Also,

00:44:03.399 --> 00:44:05.199
Don't follow me today.

00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:07.120
I don't want to see you again.

00:44:08.399 --> 00:44:09.479
Don't worry.

00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:13.120
I'll come find you.

00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:15.560
You've got me.

00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:21.879
Very impressive.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:34.199
Fan Xiao.

00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:36.639
I'm not the bodhisattva you imagine.

00:44:37.399 --> 00:44:38.760
I can't save you.

00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:40.639
Even...

00:44:41.919 --> 00:44:44.000
I can't even save myself.

00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:23.280
In the crowd

00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:26.840
I was spotted in an instant

00:45:27.959 --> 00:45:30.360
The desolation in your eyes

00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:33.520
Hiding the same fire inside

00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:36.199
No need for words

00:45:36.199 --> 00:45:39.520
No need to ask what's right or wrong

00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:42.040
The moment we drew close

00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:44.760
The outcome was already destined

00:45:52.919 --> 00:45:55.439
Is the moth drawn to the light

00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:58.800
Or the whale sinking into the deep

00:45:59.399 --> 00:46:00.919
With nothing but solitary courage

00:46:00.919 --> 00:46:03.479
I wager it all on tomorrow

00:46:04.719 --> 00:46:07.479
The walls of the world

00:46:07.479 --> 00:46:10.760
What does it matter if I break them down

00:46:11.919 --> 00:46:14.199
My chest burns with heat

00:46:14.199 --> 00:46:16.399
Screaming only for you

00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:20.199
I'll love you until it boils over

00:46:20.199 --> 00:46:22.479
Loving without a care for the world

00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:24.239
Like two stars

00:46:24.239 --> 00:46:26.239
Colliding and shattering in the night sky

00:46:26.439 --> 00:46:27.439
Even if it's just for a moment

00:46:27.439 --> 00:46:29.040
It's more than enough to surpass forever

00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:30.320
Hate and love both burn brightly

00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:33.000
Loving until the sky falls dark

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.959
Loving until we reach the end of the road

00:46:35.719 --> 00:46:36.760
Before the altar

00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:38.879
We burn all the incense

00:46:38.879 --> 00:46:39.959
Not asking for the next life

00:46:39.959 --> 00:46:41.479
Only desiring this moment

00:46:41.479 --> 00:46:42.679
Drowning together with you in

00:46:42.679 --> 00:46:44.919
This blazing fire of fate
