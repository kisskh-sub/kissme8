00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.320
How many have fought for it?

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.319
Fathers and sons turn against each other,
brothers become enemies.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.680
How much blood has stained this throne?

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:14.879
Throughout every dynasty,

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.319
countless have died vying for this seat.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.319
I do not understand.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.120
Why do people still

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.239
rush forward one after another?

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.359
Your Majesty, you are the True Dragon Son of Heaven.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.599
Everything will be as Your Majesty wishes.

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:34.599
Let us hope so.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.799
Your Majesty, the Imperial Guard requests an audience.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.120
Enter.

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:46.120
Your Majesty.

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:48.120
The Princess instructed the Imperial Kitchen

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.560
to send you this sweet soup.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.359
Just give it to me. You may leave.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.799
Yes.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:00.239
Your Majesty.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.960
It seems tonight is destined to be restless.

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:37.680
How dare you, Lu Yi!

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.159
You break into the palace at night—what is your intent?

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.400
I heard Your Majesty is gravely ill,

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.919
beyond the help of medicine.

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:50.840
I came to mourn Your Majesty.

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:54.599
Prime Minister Lü.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.759
You lead troops into the palace at night—

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.719
are you plotting to seize the throne?

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:04.120
Your Majesty.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.879
I think you misunderstand.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.919
This is not usurping power.

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:12.360
That seat was always meant for me.

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:14.120
How dare you! Outrageous!

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.080
Guards!

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:16.280
Guards!

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.719
Come!

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:23.159
Bring him here!

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:26.319
Go!

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:32.360
My dear Shi.

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:34.199
Lu Yi, you—

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:37.719
Your Ma—

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:39.400
Your Majesty.

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:44.120
Such deep loyalty between master and servant.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.919
Well then,

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.759
I’ll send you both off together today.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.639
Why are you so certain

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:55.400
that leading troops to seize power won’t be your own funeral?

00:03:57.719 --> 00:04:01.080
I have already taken control of the entire palace.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.240
Your Majesty.

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:05.159
Tell me, on what grounds do I—

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.439
Well done, Lu Yi.

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:08.360
The late emperor treated you generously.

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:10.039
Since I ascended the throne,

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:12.159
I have treated you with kindness.

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:15.080
Every matter, big or small,

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.759
I always sought your counsel first.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.279
Why would you commit such treacherous acts?

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:24.600
What a benevolent father and son.

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:27.120
Years ago, my grandfather risked his life

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:28.639
to expand the Southern Dynasty’s territory.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.680
He laid the foundation for the Southern Dynasty.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.519
He should have been this nation’s ruler.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.160
This country should bear the Lü name.

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:38.879
Now, that seat

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.199
should rightfully be mine.

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:45.800
The court raised you with high rank and riches.

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:47.000
Who would have thought

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:48.560
it would breed a wolf like you.

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:49.439
What else?

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.839
Am I

00:04:51.399 --> 00:04:52.959
just a dog you keep?

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.079
Yes.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.120
The Shi family is a pack of loyal dogs you raised.

00:05:00.399 --> 00:05:01.240
Lu Yi, you—

00:05:03.519 --> 00:05:04.839
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.759
Your Majesty.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.639
Lu Yi!

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:09.759
What have you done to His Majesty?

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:15.399
I saw His Majesty was exhausted,

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:16.959
so I made some sweet soup.

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:19.560
I added a little something extra.

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:23.439
He’ll be dead from poison within half an hour.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.040
You—

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:25.399
Your Majesty!

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:30.120
Stop struggling in vain.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.560
Shi Mengze must be dead on his way home.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.079
No one can save you today.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.680
Prime Minister Lü, don’t you think

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:42.480
the four city gates are unusually quiet?

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.160
So quiet it’s

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.680
rather strange, isn’t it?

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.720
Do you still not understand?

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:53.839
His Majesty’s troops are loyal to him.

00:05:54.519 --> 00:05:55.600
Do you think they’ll obey

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.240
a cold, lifeless Tiger Tally?

00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.720
Besides,

00:06:00.519 --> 00:06:01.360
it’s a fake.

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:03.839
No, that’s impossible!

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:06.839
Impossible!

00:06:07.079 --> 00:06:07.680
Prime Minister Lü!

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:09.279
This is your first time seeing a Tiger Tally, isn’t it?

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.360
Absolutely impossible!

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.920
Th-this can’t be!

00:06:17.079 --> 00:06:17.720
Guards!

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.360
Cut this brat down!

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:25.319
You—

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:29.000
You’re all in on this!

00:06:33.439 --> 00:06:34.160
Sorry.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:36.199
It seems

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.759
I’ll have to disappoint the esteemed Celestial Star Tower Lord.

00:06:46.879 --> 00:06:47.519
Shuang’er.

00:06:48.399 --> 00:06:49.360
It’s your turn.

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:03.959
The south and north gates are secured.

00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:06.399
The west and east gates are under control.

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:08.839
Not a single rebel escaped.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:13.839
Good.

00:07:14.199 --> 00:07:15.360
Well arranged.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.240
So you set this trap long ago,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.720
luring me in.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.160
I’ve schemed for over twenty years,

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:29.360
yet I never thought

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:30.560
I’d lose today

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.680
to a mere child like you.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.360
But do you think

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.519
I will truly lose?

00:07:37.759 --> 00:07:38.360
Guards!

00:07:40.439 --> 00:07:41.759
Hurry up and do it!

00:07:44.279 --> 00:07:44.800
This—

00:07:45.279 --> 00:07:46.680
Didn’t expect that, did you?

00:07:58.639 --> 00:07:59.120
Quick!

00:08:10.319 --> 00:08:11.279
It’s all because of you!

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:15.920
What a perfect inside-outside collaboration.

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:19.040
What a pity.

00:08:19.759 --> 00:08:21.079
You’re still one move short.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:22.160
Impossible!

00:08:22.879 --> 00:08:23.800
This can’t be!

00:08:24.439 --> 00:08:25.319
Deputy General Zhang!

00:08:25.879 --> 00:08:26.399
Go!

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:27.879
Kneel!

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:31.759
Impossible!

00:08:32.639 --> 00:08:33.559
Impossible!

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.480
Time waits for no one.

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.639
Today, I, Lu Yi, fall here.

00:08:42.519 --> 00:08:44.519
But at least the dog emperor dies with me.

00:08:45.639 --> 00:08:46.519
It’s worth it.

00:08:47.399 --> 00:08:48.320
Worth it.

00:08:51.039 --> 00:08:51.679
Is that so?

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:57.840
I’m afraid Prime Minister Lü will be disappointed again.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:16.799
You—

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:22.440
Lu Yi

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:24.799
You sold offices for profit,
took bribes.

00:09:24.879 --> 00:09:25.840
Privately raised an army.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.360
Deliberately spread disease.

00:09:27.559 --> 00:09:28.759
Embezzled disaster relief funds.

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:30.000
Incited public outrage.

00:09:30.159 --> 00:09:31.879
Colluded with the Qiang envoy,
betrayed the country.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:33.759
Each and every one of these crimes

00:09:34.039 --> 00:09:34.919
is punishable by death.

00:09:35.559 --> 00:09:36.679
I did it.

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:38.399
So what?

00:09:38.879 --> 00:09:39.519
Lu Yi

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:41.919
You harmed loyal subjects.

00:09:42.799 --> 00:09:44.039
You betrayed the nation.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:46.799
Aren't you afraid of being scorned
by the world?

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.320
Of being reviled for generations?

00:09:50.279 --> 00:09:51.159
I'm afraid.

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.720
I'm truly terrified.

00:09:53.879 --> 00:09:55.559
So scared that every night I wonder

00:09:55.639 --> 00:09:57.080
how to seize control of the capital.

00:09:57.919 --> 00:10:00.240
How to silence those who talk big.

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:03.120
Only you, Prime Minister Lü,
can make scheming for power
sound so noble.

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:05.240
Only you, Prime Minister Lü.

00:10:06.039 --> 00:10:06.879
You've already lost.

00:10:07.759 --> 00:10:08.639
Surrender now.

00:10:12.519 --> 00:10:13.720
Never.

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:15.960
I, Lu Yi, have never lost.

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:17.440
Never, not once.

00:10:18.759 --> 00:10:19.919
No one can.

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.759
No one can.

00:10:47.399 --> 00:10:48.559
It's a new day again.

00:10:50.399 --> 00:10:52.120
How does Your Majesty
plan to punish me?

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.559
If the nation is a chessboard,

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.039
then Your Majesty is the player.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.639
Officials and the common people

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:05.679
are all pieces in your hand.

00:11:08.159 --> 00:11:09.039
Your Majesty is skilled at chess,

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:11.840
naturally knows when

00:11:12.159 --> 00:11:14.360
to place each piece
in the perfect spot.

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:15.879
To control the whole game.

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:18.519
So, my dear Shi,

00:11:18.919 --> 00:11:21.360
do you think you're a good piece?

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.039
Compared to the nation's interests,

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.120
my own future as Shi Feifan

00:11:26.759 --> 00:11:27.799
is not worth mentioning.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:35.279
About those aircraft and tanks
you mentioned before,

00:11:35.799 --> 00:11:36.799
and aircraft carriers,

00:11:36.919 --> 00:11:37.879
how is the research going?

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.279
It still needs time.

00:11:42.159 --> 00:11:44.399
But don't make us wait too long.

00:11:46.399 --> 00:11:46.919
Your Majesty.

00:11:47.879 --> 00:11:49.360
My father is getting old.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.360
I beg Your Majesty to let him
retire and return home.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:53.840
To enjoy his remaining years.

00:11:56.519 --> 00:11:58.320
Venerable Minister Shi
is still vigorous.

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.080
Let him stay with us.

00:12:14.799 --> 00:12:15.480
Young Duke.

00:12:18.519 --> 00:12:19.360
Laifu.

00:12:20.799 --> 00:12:21.600
Why are you here?

00:12:21.799 --> 00:12:23.240
I promised Brother Ping'an

00:12:23.679 --> 00:12:25.559
to never leave your side,
Young Duke.

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:27.399
Not even afraid of death.

00:12:27.559 --> 00:12:28.759
If Brother Ping'an can do it,

00:12:29.039 --> 00:12:30.080
so can I.

00:12:31.639 --> 00:12:32.159
Alright.

00:12:43.039 --> 00:12:43.799
What did His Majesty say?

00:12:45.399 --> 00:12:46.000
Exile.

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:51.039
His Majesty's decree.

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:52.159
By law,

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:55.919
exile requires wearing shackles.

00:12:56.399 --> 00:12:58.759
Young Duke, I'm sorry.

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:01.440
The road is long.

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:02.600
Young Duke,

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:04.159
take care.

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:05.960
Take care.

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:10.639
Shi family's boy,

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:13.039
Xishan is yours now.

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.600
We have high hopes for you.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:21.960
His Majesty's exact words.

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:24.320
I dare not disobey.

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:27.039
Go back and tell His Majesty

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:29.159
we keep our word.

00:14:30.679 --> 00:14:31.320
Farewell.

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:50.159
Why did you come?

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:52.639
I want to go with you.

00:14:58.039 --> 00:14:59.159
I'm being exiled.

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:01.519
It's a long journey.

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:04.559
How can you come with me?

00:15:04.879 --> 00:15:06.679
I'm not afraid of hardship
or exhaustion.

00:15:07.639 --> 00:15:09.799
Even if we wander the world,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.120
or are driven into exile,

00:15:11.279 --> 00:15:12.399
I will be with you.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.279
Now that I'm disgraced,

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.480
I can't tarnish the princess's honor.

00:15:21.399 --> 00:15:23.159
If the princess insists on coming,

00:15:23.919 --> 00:15:25.120
I'm afraid my father...

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:30.120
I understand.

00:15:30.879 --> 00:15:31.720
As long as it's you in the end,

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:33.639
I'll wait for you, no matter how long.

00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:59.120
Wake up! Wake up!

00:15:59.399 --> 00:16:00.399
Are you alright?

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:02.519
Wake up.

00:16:04.279 --> 00:16:05.120
Hang in there.

00:16:05.399 --> 00:16:06.559
I'm calling 120 now.

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:09.720
Hello?

00:16:10.639 --> 00:16:11.080
Hello?

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:12.919
Is this 120?

00:16:13.639 --> 00:16:15.480
I'm on Hua Hai South Road.

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.279
There's been a car accident here.

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:19.279
Please hurry!

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:21.519
As soon as possible.

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:25.000
120 will be here soon.

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:26.000
Hang in there.

00:16:28.279 --> 00:16:29.320
Are you alright?
