Excuse me, can you do me a favor?

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:14.800
I'm working part‑time here.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:15.800
My manager asked me

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.960
to invite people inside.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.800
- What do you want?
- You...

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.640
Come on, kiddo.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:29.640
Go home with Daddy.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.600
Let go of me! Don't...

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:46.790
Don't...

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.320
Let me go!

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.280
Thank you for the offer, Mr. Zhuang,

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.910
but I don't think

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.430
I can do this job.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.150
People in the community said

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.080
you're short on money.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.710
I don't really know how to do anything,

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.470
yet you're offering such high pay.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.190
I know I'm the one you're supposed to

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.750
help through community correction,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.680
but I can't take the job

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.190
and take your money like this.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.150
Making money to find your girlfriend, huh?

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.180
(Fulfill the wish, the same person)

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.920
Feifei?

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:37.470
Feifei?

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.120
No!

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:42.550
Feifei.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.080
I'm Zelin.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.240
I'm Zelin.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:48.640
Feifei.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.960
Feifei.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:01.640
Feifei...

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.390
What did you do to her?

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:36.390
Why has she

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:37.560
ended up like this?

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:40.750
Ask you good friend from back home,

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:41.790
Zhang Chao.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.480
Zhang Chao?

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.470
Feifei. Feifei.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.840
Feifei!

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.390
Zhang Chao is not here.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.430
It's me, Zelin.

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:55.560
Feifei, listen to me.

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.240
Zelin's here.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.880
Did you hear me?

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:01.560
Zelin's here.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.120
After you went into rehab,

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:06.830
Zhang Chao tricked Feifei

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:07.950
into Jingmengwan Clubhouse.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:10.750
There,

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:13.070
she was assaulted by different men,

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.630
and they filmed it

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.510
to blackmail those men

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.360
and Feifei.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.800
As you can see,

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:21.190
Feifei couldn't handle

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:22.430
the trauma

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:25.800
and broke down.

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:34.800
Just stop running.

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.000
If you don't behave,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.070
I'll take you down.

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:40.470
You...

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.400
That's enough.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.000
We'll be busy tonight.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:46.800
And,

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.430
don't wear so many layers.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.800
Customers don't like it.

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:58.040
No way.

00:05:58.630 --> 00:05:59.630
Get out of here!

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.910
Feifei,

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:06.950
I'm Zelin.

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:10.920
I'm Zelin.

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:13.920
I'm Zelin.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:15.960
Feifei.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:46.520
Open it.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.160
You filmed all these, didn't you?

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:22.870
You still don't get it?

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.160
Your enemy is not me.

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:52.240
This is a special blend I made for you.

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:56.800
Call me anytime if you need anything.

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:03.780
(You Only Live Once)

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:49.600
(See you next time.)

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:55.270
Captain He,

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:56.620
the call center got a report.

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:57.750
Someone saw Ding Chuan downstream

00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:58.590
on the Taonan River.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:00.960
Notify everyone.

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:02.150
Move in and arrest him.

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:03.020
Use caution.

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:04.150
Wait for backup if needed.

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:04.990
Yes.

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:06.750
Team One, move out.

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:32.990
Notify tech support.

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:34.110
Yes.

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:17.960
Is it sweet?

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.280
Yes.

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:24.960
It will never be bitter.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:45.560
If I say that,

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:46.920
will they believe me?

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:55.390
Okay,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:56.840
I'll do as you say.

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:12.800
Feifei,

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:14.240
you should follow what the doctors

00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:15.320
and nurses tell you.

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:16.750
If you need anything,

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.320
just tell them.

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.990
- Thank you.
- No problem.

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:42.270
See you tomorrow, Zelin.

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:56.980

(The Birth of Crime)

(The Birth of Crime)

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:50.150
If someone commits a crime,

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:51.510
their family usually knows.

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:53.480
They just

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:56.000
choose to ignore it,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:57.840
or look the other way.

00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:01.790
You only read the chapter, right?

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:07.200
Yuan,

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:09.000
if your family commit a crime,

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:10.270
what would you do?

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:12.840
Cover it up,

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:14.000
punish

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:14.840
your kin for justice,

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:16.870
or pretend

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:18.910
you didn't know?

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.670
This isn't up for debate.

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:24.670
You said psychology

00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:25.630
was nonsense, right?

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:36.700
(The Birth of Crime)

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:38.240
This book makes it feel like anyone,

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:40.910
no matter what kind of weirdo you are,

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:44.270
can be saved as long as they avoid those

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:45.630
twisted life experiences.

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:47.910
And even if they can't be saved,

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:49.320
some people are still

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:51.200
devoted to helping them.

00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:53.350
Yuan,

00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:54.350
you're right.

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:56.240
The world

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.550
is beautiful.

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:17.820
(No More Lies)

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:19.080
You used the color block numbers

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:20.000
around the stars

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:21.600
to make a ciphertext.

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:24.750
By shifting, you produced English letters

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:29.270
forming a Bacon's cipher.

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:31.270
But I knew you wouldn't

00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:32.510
give such a simple puzzle.

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:36.720
You applied shifts to

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
the digits labeled 0,1,2,4.

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:40.790
You then re-encrypted

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:41.670
that Bacon's cipher

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:43.030
with a Vigenère cipher.

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:48.200
I knew it.

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:49.920
This time

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:51.320
won't get the better of you.

00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:54.720
You used my birthday as the key.

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:57.150
Were you worried I couldn't solve it?

00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:04.390
Vigenère encryption

00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:07.480
is meant to be solvable by specific people.

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:08.680
If it can't be cracked,

00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:10.670
it has no meaning.

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:17.820
(Final ciphertext obtained)

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:20.000
(The key is your birthday.)

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:02.980
(Longitude, Latitude
Junhao Hotel, 6 PM)

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:09.040
Yuan,

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:11.070
aren't you worried I won't find it here?

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:13.200
This is a simple coordinate deciphering.

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:15.310
How could you possibly not find it?

00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:16.720
Then the piano piece

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:17.920
you played for me today

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:20.240
is a world-class puzzle.

00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:21.960
No hint?

00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:23.750
Having the final password

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:24.960
makes the game meaningless.

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:26.680
Come on.

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:27.750
With seven basic notes

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:28.590
over five octaves

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:30.000
and 1,678 syllables

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.270
in the entire piece,

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:33.070
plus rhythm and stress variations,

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:34.750
the possibilities are in the quintillions.

00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:36.880
That's like searching for
a needle in a haystack.

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:40.200
You're about to study chemistry.

00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:41.630
How can you

00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:43.310
not have this much patience?

00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:45.070
I've been far

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:47.000
more patient with you than with chemistry.

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:50.040
See? It's all recorded.

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:51.240
I'll make use of it in college.

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:52.830
Maybe I'll crack it before

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:53.670
school even starts.

00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:55.350
But if I play that piece

00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:56.440
at random, with no

00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:58.670
ciphertext behind it,

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:02.270
you'd never solve it.

00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:06.630
You wouldn't do that.

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:08.830
Everything in this world

00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:10.510
can be turned into ciphertext.

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.350
Add a premise, layer

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:13.270
encryption on encryption,

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:15.240
and you get

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:16.080
the same result.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.070
This is just your

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:19.110
own obsession.

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:21.400
Why do you cling

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:22.720
to a fixed key?

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:28.270
All these years solving puzzles with you

00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:30.510
has been the most fun

00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:31.920
I've ever had.

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:39.340
(Freezer-body Case. Liu Wanyao: Missing.
Best Friend: WU Xinxin.)

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:41.520
(Ding Chuan, crime of passion, Hu Bo, married,
domestic-violence, Wu Xinxin, Hu Bo's body)

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:47.040
Captain He, coffee.

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:48.720
Thanks.

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:50.040
With no milk?

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.040
I forgot.

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:55.560
Captain He,

00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:58.590
we found Ding Chuan's

00:18:58.590 --> 00:18:59.830
online chats with Liu Wanyao

00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:00.670
on his phone.

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:02.480
They hadn't been discovered earlier

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:03.880
because Liu Wanyao's phone number

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:04.920
was registered under

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:05.780
someone else's ID.

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:07.590
Liu Wanyao and Ding Chuan

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:09.400
started dating three months ago.

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:11.000
Later, Ding found that Liu was

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.070
involved in prostitution.

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:13.790
They had a huge fight.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.270
Ding Chuan saw

00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:16.920
chat logs between Hu Bo and Liu Wanyao

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:18.680
and believed she was

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:19.970
being coerced by Hu Bo.

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:21.000
Then he tortured and killed him.

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:23.590
He learned those torture methods

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:24.830
from Liu Wanyao.

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:28.640
In their chat records,

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:29.720
they mentioned a foreign,

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:30.680
niche forum

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:32.240
focused on dissection and torture,

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:33.750
through which Liu and Hu

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:34.830
had originally connected.

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:39.070
Liu Wanyao also told Ding Chuan

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:40.590
about this flesh-eating bacteria.

00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:43.270
Later, Ding Chuan wanted to reconcile

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:44.920
on the condition that

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:46.160
Liu Wanyao quit her job,

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:47.510
but she refused,

00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:48.590
unwilling to give up

00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:49.430
the high-paying work.

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:51.030
So after killing Hu Bo,

00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:52.070
Ding Chuan used

00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:53.110
Hu Bo's phone

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:54.270
to text Liu Wanyao,

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:56.550
pretending to offer clients,

00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:58.110
luring her to Hu Bo's house,

00:19:58.240 --> 00:19:59.240
where he killed her,

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:00.590
dumped her body, and cleaned the scene.

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.240
He probably didn't realize

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:04.200
that another murder

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:06.110
had occurred in this room.

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:08.000
Afterwards, he hid

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.640
and lived for a while

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:10.920
using Hu Bo's identity and money.

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:12.960
If it weren't for Hu Bo's house

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:13.850
running out of electricity

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:14.880
and the freezer stopping,

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:16.240
we might never

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:17.310
have discovered the case.

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:23.160
Were the bank cards found in

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:24.000
Ding's house traced?

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:26.350
The Anti-fraud Unit investigated them.

00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:27.790
These cards had been sold in bulk

00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:29.030
by people trafficking

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:30.030
personal information.

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:31.590
First, these cards

00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:32.550
weren't used for scams.

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:34.270
Second, each card was used only once,

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:35.270
and after each

00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:36.480
legitimate transfer, the money

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:37.380
was withdrawn immediately.

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:42.270
This is why a dead man

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:44.960
could live for so long.

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:51.000
Zelin!

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:53.520
Zelin!

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:55.190
Hi, it's been a while.

00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:57.830
Why did you call?

00:20:58.030 --> 00:20:59.160
I have good news.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.200
Feifei contacted me

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:02.920
and wants to see me tonight.

00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:03.950
Really?

00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:06.240
Bro, tell me,

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:07.480
if I propose to her

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:08.880
when we meet tonight,

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:10.270
will she say yes?

00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:12.830
I say no problem!

00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:14.830
How about this? If she agrees,

00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:16.270
you two can finally

00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:17.720
live happily and steadily

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:18.720
from now on.

00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:20.560
Let the past stay in the past.

00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:21.720
No one brings it up,

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:22.560
okay?

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:25.920
Where are you meeting tonight?

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:27.200
We will come over too.

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:28.880
When you're done,

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:29.750
let's find a place

00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:30.680
to have a real party.

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:31.830
Yeah, yeah.

00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:32.670
Thanks a lot.

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:34.560
That's why I called you too.

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:35.830
Do you guys know

00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:36.670
Jinmengwan Clubhouse?

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:38.750
She said it's in a small alley

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:39.590
next to the clubhouse.

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:41.920
Jin... Jinmengwan?

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:46.110
We'll check it out.

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:47.110
Thanks.

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:50.160
I want to get ready and buy Feifei

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:51.590
a gift this afternoon.

00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:53.590
Alright, see you tonight.

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:54.590
See you tonight.

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:05.000
Xu,

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:06.720
Ge Feifei has been found.

00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:09.510
Tonight at nine,

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:11.350
in that alley

00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:12.270
next to the clubhouse.

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:16.350
Okay.

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:17.480
Okay.

00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:21.860
(Coordinates Check)

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:29.020
(Jinmengwan Clubhouse)

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:36.780
(Jinmengwan Clubhouse)

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:25.160
What am I even paying you for?

00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:26.030
You losers!

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:26.920
Hello, sir.

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:28.110
Do you have a reservation?

00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:29.240
No.

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:30.080
This way, please.

00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:33.440
Listen,

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:36.720
- This way, sir.
- this must not get out.

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:38.440
Qingqing, this customer has no reservation.

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:40.560
Hello, sir.

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:41.640
How many in your party?

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:42.880
Just one for now.

00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:44.030
Okay, please wait a moment.

00:23:44.030 --> 00:23:48.580
(Jingmengwan Clubhouse)

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:10.500
Sir,

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:12.070
we only have one large room left.

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:13.240
Minimum spend is 18,000.

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:24.920
I'm not sure

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:26.160
how many friends are coming.

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:28.590
Maybe I'll wait to see

00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:29.920
if a small room opens up.

00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:32.110
That's fine.

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:33.520
Okay.

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:47.900
(Jinmengwan, 150 meters ahead)

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:51.240
Officer Xu.

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:54.040
Who are you?

00:24:58.550 --> 00:24:59.390
Shi Zelin.

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:02.000
Shi Zelin? What are you doing here?

00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:07.240
Are you after results

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:08.590
or the truth?

00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:12.950
My house...

00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:39.030
Captain He, someone called reporting

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:40.240
a planned revenge killing.

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:41.350
That's from a public phone

00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:42.590
near Risheng Street.

00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:28.300
(Suicide Note)

00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:30.860
(Written by Shi Zelin)

00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:39.020
(Are you after results or truth?)

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:46.000
You know him?

00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:48.960
Most likely, he died from poisoning.

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:50.040
By the way,

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:52.110
we found this on him.

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:05.540
(Zhuang Mingcheng)

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:18.320
Hello?

00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:19.350
Zhuang Mingcheng?

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:22.000
Mr. Xu,

00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:23.440
you finally called me.

00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:28.160
I know you technical guys

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:29.240
are strict.

00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:30.240
No autopsy,

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:31.240
no report,

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:32.400
and no conclusion.

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:33.720
But I really need

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:34.920
your experience now.

00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:41.200
For now,

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:43.040
he's the murderer.

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:45.590
Based on ash and shoe prints

00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:46.550
at the scene,

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:48.070
he was likely the first to be here

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:49.350
and waited for a while.

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:51.400
It was likely a premeditated murder.

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:53.440
When did you

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:54.550
know Shi Zelin?

00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:57.720
When I volunteered at the community,

00:28:57.720 --> 00:28:58.960
he was my mentee.

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:01.110
I met him twice during events.

00:29:02.270 --> 00:29:03.510
Your restaurant

00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:05.590
even hosts community events?

00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:07.790
Are you meeting

00:29:07.790 --> 00:29:09.030
with Shi Zelin now?

00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:10.110
Great,

00:29:10.510 --> 00:29:11.550
let's meet then.

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:39.030
A revenge killing usually leaves

00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:39.880
a suicide note.

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:43.790
Why do you think

00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:45.000
he killed for revenge

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.510
and not out of hatred for society?

00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:47.720
The killer's goal is clear.

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:48.590
He was very calm.

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:49.880
The traces are obvious.

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:51.070
It seems he didn't try to

00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:51.920
hide his crime at all.

00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:53.680
Once he got what he wanted,

00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:55.270
he'd probably tell someone why...

00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:57.240
Enough, Sherlock Holmes.

00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:59.350
Have Tang Shiqi check these two numbers,

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:01.590
see whose names they're registered under,

00:30:01.790 --> 00:30:03.550
and check the recent call records.

00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:05.110
Okay.

00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:11.640
Shi Zelin is dead.

00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:15.200
How could that be?

00:30:17.550 --> 00:30:19.240
Then why are you

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:20.080
at his home,

00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:21.110
Mr. Xu?

00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:23.110
What are you doing here now?

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:28.270
Shi Zelin is someone I mentor.

00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:30.480
He applied for a living allowance

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:31.550
through me,

00:30:31.550 --> 00:30:33.200
and I'm responsible for delivering it.

00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:35.590
That's why I'm here.

00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:37.150
What about you?

00:30:42.270 --> 00:30:43.310
How do you explain this?

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:46.880
I heard people say

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:48.160
Shi Zelin was short on money

00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:49.310
and working multiple jobs,

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:51.160
so I invited him to my restaurant

00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:52.550
to see if he wanted to be a waiter.

00:30:52.550 --> 00:30:53.920
He said he'd think about it.

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:57.310
Then I gave him the number

00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:58.320
you have now

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.030
so he could contact me

00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:01.160
anytime once he decided.

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:04.000
Did he contact you?

00:31:05.270 --> 00:31:06.590
I never got a reply.

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:09.440
So I came tonight

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:10.750
to follow up.

00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:21.030
Here's Shi Zelin's suicide note.

00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:28.620
(Are you after results or truth?)

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:29.680
What are you after?

00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:40.680
Mr. Xu,

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:42.750
I'm recording this.

00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:47.310
If the police find

00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:48.960
Shi Zelin's body,

00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:51.920
there will be trouble.

00:31:52.270 --> 00:31:53.110
But,

00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:55.480
this can prove my innocence.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.310
Compared to me,

00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:02.480
a foreign volunteer,

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:05.510
it's even harder to explain

00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:07.070
why a dismissed officer

00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:11.000
would show up at the victim's home.

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:23.270
(Shi Zelin is dead.)

00:32:23.270 --> 00:32:24.480
I hope our meeting

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:26.070
here tonight

00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:27.070
(How could that be?)

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:30.110
stays between us.

00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:30.960
(Then why are you)

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:31.800
(at his home,)

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:32.830
(Mr. Xu?)

00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:34.880
(What are you doing here now?)

00:32:37.510 --> 00:32:38.830
I heard that after

00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:40.030
leaving rehab,

00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:41.110
Shi Zelin never relapsed.

00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:43.920
I ran into him a few days ago.

00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:45.830
He was juggling several jobs a day,

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:46.920
working tirelessly while

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:49.400
searching for his girlfriend.

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:51.640
I didn't expect this happen to him.

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:55.590
As police officers,

00:32:56.350 --> 00:32:57.200
we solve every case

00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:58.200
we take on,

00:32:58.880 --> 00:32:59.880
and it brings peace

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:01.480
to the victims' souls.

00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:03.960
Captain He, check the work group.

00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:05.630
We got a message.

00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:12.620
(Victim Information)

00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:14.000
Shi Zelin was from

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.590
the same hometown
as Zhang Chao and Han Kuo.

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:18.400
He was lured into drugs

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:19.480
by those two.

00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:21.160
How did they get back in touch?

00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:25.880
The priority now is confirming

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:27.350
the identity of the third victim.

00:33:27.790 --> 00:33:29.550
Liu Ming, head back to the station

00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:30.880
and wait for the tech report.

00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:32.640
We'll go to Shi Zelin's home.

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:34.300
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:33:39.510 --> 00:33:40.550
Mr. Xu,

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:44.790
no wonder you teach Criminal Psychology.

00:33:44.790 --> 00:33:46.400
You've got nerves of steel.

00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:50.270
You came back from the scene

00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:51.920
without even changing your clothes?

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.640
What exactly is your purpose?

00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:58.240
I just want to ask,

00:33:59.000 --> 00:33:59.840
Mr. Xu,

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:02.110
how long do you plan

00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:03.350
to stay here?

00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:05.240
I'm thinking for your own good.

00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:06.830
The police will

00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:07.960
trace things here soon.

00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:16.920
This is a gesture of my sincerity.

00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:18.870
Of course,

00:34:19.110 --> 00:34:20.920
if the police question me,

00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:23.760
I'll tell them everything

00:34:24.110 --> 00:34:25.400
about meeting you,

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:26.920
Mr. Xu, right here,

00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:28.480
tonight.

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:32.510
But I also believe,

00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:34.880
you will

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.590
keep our

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:40.190
shared secret.

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:51.320
Thank you.

00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:51.440
Be careful going upstairs later.

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:32.620
(Suicide Note)

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:45.320
I found his suicide note.

00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:53.780
(Sorry, Captain He. You're a good person.
I may not be able to be one.)

00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:55.420
(Are you after results or truth?)

00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:56.940
(I'll make them pay! Die! Kill them!)

00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:31.630
