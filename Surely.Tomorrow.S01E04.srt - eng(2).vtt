SURELY TOMORROW

00:00:44.967 --> 00:00:45.067
SURELY TOMORROW

00:00:47.152 --> 00:00:50.447
EMERGENCY

00:00:51.448 --> 00:00:53.325
Ji-woo…

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:24.273
Hey, are you awake?

00:01:25.566 --> 00:01:26.775
What am I doing here?

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:28.193
Why…

00:01:29.486 --> 00:01:31.363
Why did you do that?

00:01:31.947 --> 00:01:34.867
Se-yeong, what are you doing here?

00:01:36.785 --> 00:01:38.037
Why are we…

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.914
Kyeong-do carried you here.

00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:46.420
Ji-woo,

00:01:47.421 --> 00:01:50.174
I have to go because Dong-won has a fever.

00:01:50.841 --> 00:01:54.011
But Kyeong-do is here,
so make sure to get treated, okay?

00:01:54.094 --> 00:01:56.305
Sorry, Se-yeong. You should get going.

00:01:56.388 --> 00:01:58.682
No need to say sorry.

00:02:01.685 --> 00:02:03.228
My head is pounding.

00:02:08.525 --> 00:02:09.860
Drop me off here.

00:02:13.113 --> 00:02:14.531
Are you sure you can walk?

00:02:14.615 --> 00:02:15.491
Yes.

00:02:18.243 --> 00:02:19.119
Hey, Seo Ji-woo.

00:02:25.042 --> 00:02:28.754
Why would you take pills with alcohol?
What were you thinking?

00:02:29.838 --> 00:02:32.257
If it weren't for Se-yeong,
you could've been gone.

00:02:32.341 --> 00:02:34.635
Did your decibel rise as you got older?

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:41.892
Fine. Then those pills.
Why did you take them?

00:02:44.061 --> 00:02:45.646
Because my mom came by.

00:02:46.397 --> 00:02:49.316
And I really don't like her.
She pissed me off.

00:02:50.985 --> 00:02:54.029
Our mom is not a good mom.

00:02:54.113 --> 00:02:56.365
I didn't take them to die,
so don't overreact.

00:02:58.617 --> 00:02:59.618
Overreact?

00:03:01.286 --> 00:03:03.872
Sure, I overreacted
and ran with you on my back.

00:03:03.956 --> 00:03:07.418
I couldn't sleep.
Not even with the sleeping pill.

00:03:07.501 --> 00:03:10.129
So I took another one,
but I still couldn't sleep.

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.465
That's what happened.

00:03:14.091 --> 00:03:16.218
Is it true?
You did that just because you were drunk?

00:03:16.301 --> 00:03:19.013
How many times do I have to say it,
damn Lee Kyeong-do?

00:03:20.014 --> 00:03:22.641
I'm already out of energy as it is.
Stop roasting me.

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:29.231
"Damn Lee Kyeong-do," wasting your time.
What the hell did I do that for?

00:03:32.317 --> 00:03:33.402
Go.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.777
Fucking lunatic.

00:04:26.121 --> 00:04:27.122
Hey.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.212
Hey.

00:04:33.295 --> 00:04:35.506
Overdosing on sleeping pills
after drinking?

00:04:35.589 --> 00:04:38.050
You want everyone to know?
Should I write an article?

00:04:38.133 --> 00:04:39.426
Now be quiet and listen.

00:04:41.428 --> 00:04:43.931
When humans drink alcohol,
they become idiots.

00:04:44.681 --> 00:04:46.058
It's okay if you know when to stop.

00:04:46.141 --> 00:04:50.395
But some don't know when to stop.
Like Seo Ji-woo and Lee Kyeong-do.

00:04:52.481 --> 00:04:56.401
That weed party in 2018,
why do you think you went there?

00:04:56.485 --> 00:05:00.989
You don't even smoke. Huh? You got drunk,
and you didn't know where you ended up.

00:05:01.073 --> 00:05:04.201
Imagine being a smoker.
Then you would've been in real trouble.

00:05:04.284 --> 00:05:06.161
You won't drink when there's no more left.

00:05:07.663 --> 00:05:12.459
You were a lunatic not to have realized
how many sleeping pills you were taking.

00:05:12.543 --> 00:05:14.336
Do you collect my articles?

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:19.216
What about the gum on the way
to the fashion show? How do you know?

00:05:19.299 --> 00:05:22.553
I dare you to buy alcohol again.
I'll come back and throw everything out.

00:05:22.636 --> 00:05:25.180
Who are you? Who do you think you are?

00:05:25.264 --> 00:05:28.016
What else? It's humanity.

00:05:32.563 --> 00:05:34.106
Get out.

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:37.609
Whether I drink or take pills,
mind your own business.

00:05:37.693 --> 00:05:40.404
So stop drinking already!

00:05:59.506 --> 00:06:03.010
I know it's tough.

00:06:03.635 --> 00:06:05.137
I know it best.

00:06:06.805 --> 00:06:08.765
Still, you shouldn't drink anymore.

00:06:10.142 --> 00:06:14.354
That's, you know, extremely tough.

00:06:15.272 --> 00:06:17.816
It's better to make an effort
sooner rather than later. Okay?

00:06:19.943 --> 00:06:23.280
Okay. I hear you.

00:06:26.575 --> 00:06:27.576
Leave now, will you?

00:06:30.913 --> 00:06:33.081
Sleep tight and order some porridge.

00:06:33.832 --> 00:06:35.584
You had your stomach pumped, so go easy.

00:06:37.336 --> 00:06:38.795
I'm sick of this.

00:06:39.296 --> 00:06:42.591
I heard you, so get out.
You're making me sober.

00:06:46.929 --> 00:06:49.640
Make sure to order porridge, okay?

00:07:02.486 --> 00:07:03.737
SURELY TOMORROW

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.364
EPISODE 4

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:08.659
See? I told you it'd look good on you.

00:07:08.742 --> 00:07:09.701
SPRING, 2007

00:07:09.785 --> 00:07:11.203
Everything looks good on me.

00:07:12.079 --> 00:07:16.667
That's true, but I think
this looks particularly good on you.

00:07:18.377 --> 00:07:19.503
Kyeong-do,

00:07:20.462 --> 00:07:22.339
I got overwhelmed while putting this on.

00:07:26.134 --> 00:07:27.344
Because you felt my love?

00:07:27.427 --> 00:07:29.763
I felt how much you worked your ass off.

00:07:29.846 --> 00:07:32.641
You must've worked your ass off
with all those plates, huh?

00:07:34.685 --> 00:07:39.106
Instead of saying "working my ass off,"
I prefer hearing "working hard."

00:07:39.606 --> 00:07:41.900
Whatever. Let's go. There's a place to go.

00:07:42.567 --> 00:07:43.652
Where?

00:07:45.279 --> 00:07:48.323
See? I knew this color
would look perfect on you.

00:07:48.407 --> 00:07:49.408
It looks nice.

00:07:50.075 --> 00:07:54.871
But if you do this, my gift doesn't shine.
Is this give and take?

00:07:56.748 --> 00:07:59.710
Okay, fine. Give and take.
All right. Very good. Yes.

00:08:02.379 --> 00:08:05.590
It's 322,000 won.
How would you like to pay?

00:08:05.674 --> 00:08:07.301
-I'll pay in full.
-Oh, okay.

00:08:08.802 --> 00:08:12.264
Matching outfits.
It matches the color of my dress, right?

00:08:12.347 --> 00:08:13.265
APPROVED

00:08:14.266 --> 00:08:15.267
Sure.

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:19.938
Here is your card and your receipt.

00:08:22.149 --> 00:08:24.693
-I'm home.
-Did you have dinner?

00:08:25.485 --> 00:08:26.528
Yeah, I did.

00:08:27.195 --> 00:08:28.363
Good job.

00:08:28.947 --> 00:08:30.574
Gosh.

00:08:31.908 --> 00:08:34.036
I barely made 300,000 won this month.

00:08:42.502 --> 00:08:44.212
Wash your feet. They stink.

00:08:45.505 --> 00:08:46.506
Okay.

00:08:58.769 --> 00:09:01.855
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
SENT

00:09:12.616 --> 00:09:15.327
Lee Kyeong-do, call me, seriously.

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:18.455
Why are you just standing there?
Do something else.

00:09:18.538 --> 00:09:21.208
Kyeong-do, you know
that tree is the most important, right?

00:09:22.209 --> 00:09:23.210
Yes.

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:25.295
Hold it tight! It's scary.

00:09:25.796 --> 00:09:27.839
Gosh, it's taking all day.

00:09:27.923 --> 00:09:30.175
-Will you spend all day on it?
-Okay, okay.

00:09:30.258 --> 00:09:32.052
JOO

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:37.057
I'm off to the restroom.

00:09:43.397 --> 00:09:44.523
Looks like a break-up.

00:09:44.606 --> 00:09:46.900
Is Kyeong-do having a hard time?

00:09:51.738 --> 00:09:55.867
This stop is Dobong District Office.

00:10:08.922 --> 00:10:10.924
I told you I was going
to your neighborhood.

00:10:11.007 --> 00:10:13.510
I know you're tired.
You made the stage today.

00:10:13.593 --> 00:10:15.720
-Did it go well?
-Yes.

00:10:16.263 --> 00:10:17.931
I'll go see it.

00:10:19.558 --> 00:10:20.725
Did I make you wait?

00:10:21.393 --> 00:10:24.020
Oh, no. It wasn't so bad.

00:10:24.104 --> 00:10:25.105
Okay.

00:10:27.482 --> 00:10:29.484
Did you all make the stage together?

00:10:29.568 --> 00:10:32.028
Yeah, well, I only do...

00:10:32.612 --> 00:10:34.239
what they tell me to do.

00:10:34.322 --> 00:10:35.657
Anything funny happened?

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.787
Well… no. I was just busy.

00:10:45.417 --> 00:10:48.253
Let's eat. I haven't had dinner yet.

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:54.259
There's a good pork cutlet place
over there.

00:10:55.051 --> 00:10:57.220
But I want tteokbokki.

00:10:59.264 --> 00:11:02.851
Let's have pork cutlet. It's on me
since you've come to my neighborhood.

00:11:11.234 --> 00:11:12.903
You love tteokbokki so much.

00:11:13.737 --> 00:11:14.738
Let's go.

00:11:14.821 --> 00:11:21.453
TTEOKBOKKI
BUNSIK

00:11:31.671 --> 00:11:32.672
Why? Is it bad?

00:11:33.465 --> 00:11:34.382
No.

00:11:36.092 --> 00:11:37.719
I thought you were hungry.

00:11:38.845 --> 00:11:41.348
-Do you want the pork cutlet--
-What's up with you?

00:11:42.807 --> 00:11:43.683
What?

00:11:45.143 --> 00:11:47.729
You know I've always liked tteokbokki.

00:11:48.522 --> 00:11:50.815
So we even had it twice a day.

00:11:54.986 --> 00:11:55.904
So?

00:11:58.823 --> 00:12:03.119
Why are you suddenly insisting
on having pork cutlets we barely eat?

00:12:06.164 --> 00:12:10.502
I just thought it'd be a good idea
to try something else.

00:12:14.047 --> 00:12:17.425
Because I'm the daughter of JARIM Apparel,

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:22.597
are you suddenly feeling uncomfortable
having bunsik with me, Kyeong-do?

00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:38.572
I said I'd meet you in Apgujeong.

00:12:39.114 --> 00:12:42.200
-It's too--
-Better than where your school is.

00:12:44.035 --> 00:12:45.495
-What I'm saying is--
-What?

00:12:47.998 --> 00:12:49.708
Are you trying to match the level?

00:12:58.967 --> 00:13:00.969
Kyeong-do. Lee Kyeong-do.

00:13:01.052 --> 00:13:02.220
What do you want me to do then?

00:13:04.723 --> 00:13:05.974
Don't you think about how I feel?

00:13:07.183 --> 00:13:09.894
Everyone around me is like me

00:13:11.229 --> 00:13:12.689
and my family.

00:13:13.273 --> 00:13:16.484
This is beyond my…

00:13:18.236 --> 00:13:21.531
Ji-woo, will you give me
some time to get used to it?

00:13:21.615 --> 00:13:22.616
"Get used to it"?

00:13:23.408 --> 00:13:25.869
Do you need to get used to seeing someone?

00:13:25.952 --> 00:13:29.080
Either I'm too young to know, or...

00:13:29.706 --> 00:13:30.665
too poor to know.

00:13:30.749 --> 00:13:32.375
Hey, seriously…

00:13:33.001 --> 00:13:36.504
Why do you have to be so twisted?
What is wrong with you?

00:13:36.588 --> 00:13:37.589
Ji-woo.

00:13:39.007 --> 00:13:42.385
Because you're visiting my neighborhood,

00:13:42.469 --> 00:13:46.389
I wanted to get you decent pork cutlet.
Why are you so uncomfortable about it?

00:13:46.473 --> 00:13:50.101
I like tteokbokki more than pork cutlet.
I've always liked it!

00:13:50.185 --> 00:13:54.064
I know that!
But I wanted to get you a pork cutlet!

00:13:54.147 --> 00:13:57.776
I've been thinking about it since school.
So I even borrowed...

00:13:59.277 --> 00:14:00.612
money from the other guys.

00:14:02.822 --> 00:14:05.283
Can't you just eat it? Huh?

00:14:05.825 --> 00:14:08.745
And make me proud.
Can't you do that for me?

00:14:14.959 --> 00:14:16.086
Damn it.

00:14:19.255 --> 00:14:20.298
I'm sorry.

00:14:21.633 --> 00:14:25.387
I just don't know what to do.

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:29.182
What's so hard? What's so hard about it?

00:14:31.101 --> 00:14:34.312
The shirt you bought me.
You asked me why I don't wear it.

00:14:35.605 --> 00:14:37.649
322,000 won.

00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:41.486
That's how much my mom makes in a month
from a side job.

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:45.407
You know,

00:14:46.032 --> 00:14:49.369
I know that I shouldn't act like this.

00:14:51.454 --> 00:14:55.125
But my parents always work so hard,
and that was…

00:14:56.835 --> 00:14:58.712
That was natural for me.

00:15:00.171 --> 00:15:03.383
But after meeting you,

00:15:04.384 --> 00:15:06.386
everything that used to be natural…

00:15:09.347 --> 00:15:11.015
feels so different.

00:15:21.234 --> 00:15:22.235
I'm sorry.

00:15:22.944 --> 00:15:25.321
This isn't your fault, but I…

00:15:35.874 --> 00:15:37.083
Sorry.

00:15:39.419 --> 00:15:41.504
No, I'm…

00:15:42.255 --> 00:15:43.089
I'm sorry.

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:50.430
Kyeong-do, I'm sorry.

00:15:51.389 --> 00:15:53.975
For buying you a 322,000 won shirt.

00:15:54.058 --> 00:15:57.479
I'm so sorry that I got you that shirt.

00:15:57.562 --> 00:15:59.939
Ji-woo, that's…

00:16:01.775 --> 00:16:04.444
I never thought about how you'd feel.

00:16:08.656 --> 00:16:10.784
I'm really sorry, Kyeong-do.

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:16.247
Let's talk about this later.

00:16:18.249 --> 00:16:21.044
I'll go now.

00:16:46.236 --> 00:16:47.237
Shit.

00:16:53.576 --> 00:16:56.120
Oh, goddamn it.

00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:19.602
The call cannot be connected.
Please leave a message…

00:17:21.354 --> 00:17:23.940
Ji-woo, is everything all right?

00:17:24.524 --> 00:17:26.025
Why can't I get a hold of you?

00:17:27.777 --> 00:17:29.112
I'm really sorry.

00:17:30.071 --> 00:17:31.573
That's not what I meant.

00:17:32.782 --> 00:17:34.242
I should've given it more thought.

00:17:35.326 --> 00:17:39.414
Let me see you for a second.
Do you want to meet near your house?

00:17:39.497 --> 00:17:40.623
Ji-woo.

00:17:40.707 --> 00:17:41.708
Ji-woo.

00:17:44.294 --> 00:17:45.461
Ji-woo.

00:17:46.588 --> 00:17:48.089
Mr. Kim!

00:17:48.172 --> 00:17:49.424
Mr. Kim!

00:17:50.008 --> 00:17:51.175
Yes, ma'am.

00:18:36.846 --> 00:18:37.847
Ji-woo.

00:18:48.733 --> 00:18:51.402
I'll... go.

00:18:56.532 --> 00:18:57.867
I'll go to New York.

00:19:01.663 --> 00:19:02.664
Okay.

00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:12.674
Yes, Secretary Yang.

00:19:13.925 --> 00:19:16.678
Get ready to send Ji-woo to New York. Yes.

00:19:17.637 --> 00:19:21.015
The faster, the better. Okay.

00:19:45.581 --> 00:19:47.625
BOARDING PASS

00:19:54.465 --> 00:19:57.927
May I have your attention, please?
Flight 611…

00:20:41.721 --> 00:20:43.139
Nice, good.

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:45.683
Hey, wait…

00:20:45.767 --> 00:20:49.187
Excuse me.
Will you get off the field? Hey!

00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:51.981
Go around him.

00:20:56.611 --> 00:20:59.989
Kyeong-do, be happy.

00:21:02.742 --> 00:21:04.077
I'll be happy too.

00:21:38.111 --> 00:21:39.779

00:22:25.783 --> 00:22:26.617
What the hell?

00:22:41.507 --> 00:22:43.259
Hey!

00:22:45.219 --> 00:22:46.304
Get in.

00:22:46.846 --> 00:22:47.930
I have to go to work.

00:23:09.285 --> 00:23:12.288
There's a bakery open at this hour.
Do you want to go?

00:23:15.291 --> 00:23:17.168
I'm late even if I go in now.

00:23:17.251 --> 00:23:18.836
That's none of my business.

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:19.921
Shoot…

00:23:21.839 --> 00:23:23.883
-You woke up early.
-I couldn't sleep.

00:23:25.218 --> 00:23:28.930
I stayed up all night
watching the useful videos you sent me.

00:23:29.931 --> 00:23:33.684
What do you want me to do?
Are you saying that I'm an alcoholic?

00:23:33.768 --> 00:23:35.394
Is my life doomed?

00:23:36.062 --> 00:23:37.521
If you drink that much, you never know.

00:23:38.898 --> 00:23:40.107
Hey,

00:23:40.816 --> 00:23:45.071
if your mom tells you to study when
you're just about to, would it upset you?

00:23:46.113 --> 00:23:47.114
It would.

00:23:47.198 --> 00:23:49.492
You plan to lose weight
but your boyfriend tells you to do so,

00:23:49.575 --> 00:23:50.701
wouldn't it piss you off?

00:23:51.661 --> 00:23:53.788
-It would.
-And yet why are you doing this?

00:23:55.331 --> 00:23:58.668
My algorithm gave me
a lot of useful information.

00:23:58.751 --> 00:24:01.879
So I thought it'd be helpful
since you're slacking off. Too much?

00:24:01.963 --> 00:24:06.634
Then sit down with me and read together
or work out with me.

00:24:06.717 --> 00:24:10.680
That's how you show support.
Instead of bombarding me with videos.

00:24:26.028 --> 00:24:26.862
Take them off.

00:24:28.281 --> 00:24:29.407
What?

00:24:34.245 --> 00:24:38.249
Hey, it hurts so much.

00:24:40.293 --> 00:24:41.919
Hey, are you okay?

00:24:46.215 --> 00:24:47.800
Jeez, she's so cold-hearted.

00:24:48.592 --> 00:24:50.553
Wait. I can't do it. I can't.

00:24:53.597 --> 00:24:55.224
Gosh, it's so painful.

00:24:57.435 --> 00:24:59.645
Hey, are you done?

00:25:00.354 --> 00:25:01.772
Then I'll walk this way.

00:25:05.526 --> 00:25:07.570
Gosh, you and your temper.

00:25:07.653 --> 00:25:10.698
People usually become kind as they age,
but you are… Jeez.

00:25:10.781 --> 00:25:13.534
If I really let it out,
it would've been you I stepped on.

00:25:13.617 --> 00:25:17.163
Why did I find all that information
until my eyes fell out?

00:25:23.794 --> 00:25:24.962
What are you doing?

00:25:25.338 --> 00:25:26.172
Washing my feet.

00:25:26.255 --> 00:25:28.632
You still have soil there.

00:25:28.716 --> 00:25:31.302
Where? Here?

00:25:31.385 --> 00:25:35.598
Seriously. Jeez. Hey, come here.

00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:40.561
-Hey, here…
-Hey.

00:25:42.646 --> 00:25:44.023
Oh, come on.

00:25:50.029 --> 00:25:53.324
It's still here. Did you do a somersault
when I didn't see you?

00:25:53.407 --> 00:25:55.034
Gosh, hey, the other foot.

00:25:57.286 --> 00:25:58.704
-Over here.
-Where?

00:25:58.788 --> 00:26:00.831
-Here.
-"Here"? Here too?

00:26:08.047 --> 00:26:11.842
Done. Oh, seriously,
you can't even wash your feet?

00:26:13.552 --> 00:26:14.553
Jeez.

00:26:19.141 --> 00:26:20.142
What are you doing?

00:26:20.935 --> 00:26:21.769
Drying my feet.

00:26:27.108 --> 00:26:28.401
Man.

00:26:32.405 --> 00:26:33.406
Here.

00:26:51.799 --> 00:26:55.511
You do it.
Seriously, you're such a handful.

00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:04.728
Don't shake it. Wipe with it.

00:27:07.523 --> 00:27:08.524
Oh, seriously.

00:27:29.003 --> 00:27:31.714
Hop in. You stayed up all night.
You'll doze off and get into an accident.

00:27:34.133 --> 00:27:35.134
Sure.

00:28:14.757 --> 00:28:17.092
Lee Kyeong-do is such a gentleman.

00:28:18.302 --> 00:28:21.263
But what is this conclusion?
You're still leaving?

00:28:22.348 --> 00:28:24.099
-Yeah.
-When?

00:28:28.437 --> 00:28:29.688
Would you stay if I yell at you?

00:28:30.564 --> 00:28:33.817
Don't even think about dragging me
into the company. For whose sake?

00:28:33.901 --> 00:28:34.902
Ji-woo.

00:28:34.985 --> 00:28:38.489
I told Mom that I know everything.

00:28:40.407 --> 00:28:42.034
And that you told me.

00:28:45.371 --> 00:28:50.876
I've thought about
why Dad mentioned my shares in his will.

00:28:52.044 --> 00:28:54.004
"Seo Ji-woo assumes
the position of director

00:28:54.129 --> 00:28:56.215
and the shares shall be transferred
two years later."

00:28:57.967 --> 00:29:00.094
He's telling me to defend myself.

00:29:01.011 --> 00:29:03.889
To show that I may not be his daughter,
but I can make a big contribution.

00:29:03.973 --> 00:29:05.766
So no one should question me.

00:29:05.849 --> 00:29:06.976
Nothing was handed to me.

00:29:07.685 --> 00:29:09.562
If you know that, why're you running away?

00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:12.523
It's his company.

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:17.194
He raised me like his own daughter.
That's more than enough for me.

00:29:27.871 --> 00:29:30.666
How would my shares help sell the company?

00:29:30.749 --> 00:29:33.669
CEO Seo, who is the major stockholder,
wouldn't budge.

00:29:34.211 --> 00:29:35.421
I mean, what's the point?

00:29:35.504 --> 00:29:39.633
Don't worry about her shares.
They'll be settled naturally.

00:29:40.217 --> 00:29:41.719
What matters is your decision.

00:29:45.431 --> 00:29:48.767
I'm discussing with you a very important,
risky matter,

00:29:49.393 --> 00:29:53.397
which can't be even discussed
with CEO Seo.

00:29:53.981 --> 00:29:55.149
It means that I'm all in.

00:29:57.526 --> 00:29:59.653
Now is the time to throw them.

00:30:00.446 --> 00:30:03.073
Selling them in a rush
won't get you the right price.

00:30:05.409 --> 00:30:08.245
You've explained this to me already
last time.

00:30:09.246 --> 00:30:11.290
What I find strange,

00:30:11.915 --> 00:30:15.961
is that CEO Seo is working day and night.

00:30:16.045 --> 00:30:20.758
They say the clothing business is sinking,
but JARIM Apparel isn't in deficit.

00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:24.845
Then why are you saying
we need to sell the company?

00:30:25.387 --> 00:30:28.057
And why is now the time
to throw my shares?

00:30:28.599 --> 00:30:31.143
CEO Seo Ji-yeon
won't be working for too long.

00:30:31.810 --> 00:30:35.189
I'm the only one who knows about this.
Well, now you know it too.

00:30:35.272 --> 00:30:36.440
What do you mean?

00:30:38.025 --> 00:30:40.527
The owner of the company
will collapse soon.

00:30:41.236 --> 00:30:42.154
She's very sick.

00:30:42.738 --> 00:30:47.284
Well, she's not telling her family either.

00:30:47.368 --> 00:30:50.120
Well, her symptoms will get worse
in less than a year.

00:30:51.121 --> 00:30:54.750
What symptoms?
Is she terminal or something?

00:30:54.833 --> 00:30:58.170
Alzheimer's. She has dementia.

00:31:05.844 --> 00:31:07.346
What about Seo Ji-woo?

00:31:08.138 --> 00:31:12.059
I know she has no shares, but she's still
the daughter of the former chairman.

00:31:12.142 --> 00:31:14.561
Oh, Executive Director Choi,

00:31:14.645 --> 00:31:15.938
don't you know Seo Ji-woo?

00:31:16.021 --> 00:31:19.900
She can't do anything productive
except for breathing.

00:31:19.983 --> 00:31:22.945
All she thinks about is having fun abroad.
That girl...

00:31:25.406 --> 00:31:26.657
You can't call her "that girl."

00:31:27.825 --> 00:31:29.493
You sound pretty aggressive.

00:31:31.245 --> 00:31:33.831
If I sell the company,

00:31:33.914 --> 00:31:35.499
what's in it for me?

00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:39.503
MANZAAR. You can take the men's wear.

00:31:40.087 --> 00:31:41.922
It's your dream to run your own company.

00:31:45.676 --> 00:31:46.760
Sounds good to me.

00:31:48.262 --> 00:31:49.555
All right. Let's eat.

00:32:15.914 --> 00:32:17.332
Has CEO Seo noticed?

00:32:17.416 --> 00:32:19.793
She loves coffee, so she drinks it often.

00:32:30.387 --> 00:32:32.389
Anyway, what kind of drugs are these?

00:32:32.931 --> 00:32:34.808
She's not responding much.

00:32:34.892 --> 00:32:36.018
You don't need to know.

00:32:36.477 --> 00:32:39.104
She's sensitive.
Be careful not to get caught.

00:32:39.188 --> 00:32:42.316
I need to know
if this would kill her or not.

00:32:42.399 --> 00:32:43.901
I'd end up becoming a murderer.

00:32:47.404 --> 00:32:49.072
It won't kill her.

00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:51.450
Just do your job.

00:33:01.794 --> 00:33:03.295
Today's sermon was great.

00:33:04.963 --> 00:33:05.964
Exactly.

00:33:06.632 --> 00:33:07.633
Thank you. Bye.

00:33:07.716 --> 00:33:09.927
-Yes. Bye.
-Be careful. Bye.

00:33:33.784 --> 00:33:38.163
Kyeong-do.

00:33:38.247 --> 00:33:41.291
Let's go sleep at home, will you? Get up.

00:33:42.918 --> 00:33:43.919
Lean on me.

00:33:45.879 --> 00:33:47.089
Kyeong-do.

00:33:48.715 --> 00:33:51.009
-Let's go home.
-Oh, my gosh. It's cold.

00:33:51.093 --> 00:33:52.094
Should we call the police?

00:33:52.177 --> 00:33:56.098
Kyeong-do, wake up, will you?

00:33:57.140 --> 00:33:59.268
Let's go home with Mommy, yes?

00:34:04.565 --> 00:34:05.399
Kyeong-do.

00:34:09.111 --> 00:34:10.737
You scared me. You…

00:34:12.322 --> 00:34:16.118
Mom, still, when I used to drink a lot,

00:34:16.201 --> 00:34:19.371
I never slept elsewhere.
I always slept here.

00:34:21.039 --> 00:34:23.625
That is still praiseworthy, right?

00:34:25.085 --> 00:34:28.255
How embarrassing. My goodness.

00:34:30.299 --> 00:34:33.010
Were you waiting for me?
Were you on night duty?

00:34:33.093 --> 00:34:33.969
Yes.

00:34:35.387 --> 00:34:38.515
Mom, add a person to your prayer list.

00:34:41.351 --> 00:34:42.352
Gosh.

00:34:45.939 --> 00:34:47.149
PRAYER NOTE

00:34:48.692 --> 00:34:49.526
Name.

00:34:53.238 --> 00:34:54.823
Just put it down as my friend.

00:34:56.825 --> 00:34:59.494
KYEONG-DO'S FRIEND

00:35:00.662 --> 00:35:02.331
What should I pray for?

00:35:06.668 --> 00:35:08.670
No, never mind.
There's nothing to pray for.

00:35:15.636 --> 00:35:16.637
Mom.

00:35:17.638 --> 00:35:21.058
What are you, a kid?
Why do you keep calling me?

00:35:21.141 --> 00:35:22.142
Mom, Mom.

00:35:22.225 --> 00:35:23.226
Yes?

00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:27.898
The thing is,

00:35:29.566 --> 00:35:33.695
my friend drinks too much.

00:35:34.529 --> 00:35:38.283
But when you take a look at his life,
everything can be an excuse to drink.

00:35:38.367 --> 00:35:42.496
He can't stop drinking
because of frustration. I know it well.

00:35:46.833 --> 00:35:48.085
Sorry about that time.

00:35:53.048 --> 00:35:58.679
But I'm not sure about how to help him.

00:36:01.014 --> 00:36:02.933
He's going far away.

00:36:04.184 --> 00:36:06.728
Where he doesn't know anyone.

00:36:06.812 --> 00:36:08.271
He'll end up drinking more.

00:36:11.942 --> 00:36:14.069
I'm worried from the bottom of my heart.

00:36:15.779 --> 00:36:17.739
He might die in England.

00:36:18.615 --> 00:36:20.283
How was it when you got treated?

00:36:21.952 --> 00:36:22.786
Me?

00:36:22.869 --> 00:36:25.038
You probably had something in mind.

00:36:25.122 --> 00:36:27.749
"If this had happened,
I wouldn't have drank."

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:32.170
"If someone did this for me,
I wouldn't think about drinking."

00:36:32.254 --> 00:36:33.588
Didn't you have one?

00:36:40.053 --> 00:36:41.054
I did.

00:36:44.016 --> 00:36:46.810
Now, it's annoying
that it's not me or Dad.

00:36:53.108 --> 00:36:58.280
Seriously, I think you're the funniest mom
among all moms I know.

00:36:58.363 --> 00:37:01.533
If I got a promotion for being funny,
I'd be a senior deaconess.

00:37:06.246 --> 00:37:08.373
Cheer up, Mom.

00:37:12.544 --> 00:37:16.381
Cheer up and look after Ji-woo.

00:37:16.465 --> 00:37:19.843
You've never been a true mom to her.
You should do it now.

00:37:22.804 --> 00:37:25.682
Hey, you've known everything, but why--

00:37:25.766 --> 00:37:27.142
Mom.

00:37:27.225 --> 00:37:31.313
I don't care about the choices you made
or the kind of life you lived.

00:37:31.396 --> 00:37:33.440
That's between you and Dad.

00:37:34.107 --> 00:37:35.358
What upsets me is,

00:37:36.485 --> 00:37:38.695
what has Ji-woo done wrong?

00:37:38.779 --> 00:37:42.949
Why do you hate her so much?
How come you never pay attention to her?

00:37:44.326 --> 00:37:48.080
All I care about

00:37:48.163 --> 00:37:53.710
is how to draw your attention to Ji-woo.
How to make you approve of her!

00:37:59.674 --> 00:38:01.843
I should've just let her be.

00:38:02.469 --> 00:38:04.971
I should've just let her live
the way she wanted.

00:38:06.223 --> 00:38:08.183
I should've just let her be back then.

00:38:08.266 --> 00:38:11.478
How could you never…

00:38:27.244 --> 00:38:30.622
Call me when you leave the hospital.
I'll send Secretary Cha.

00:38:39.381 --> 00:38:41.633
JARIM APPAREL

00:38:41.716 --> 00:38:44.010
DIRECTOR
KANG MIN-WOO

00:38:46.555 --> 00:38:47.556
What is it?

00:38:47.639 --> 00:38:49.015
You have a quick delivery.

00:38:51.268 --> 00:38:52.853
It doesn't say where it's from.

00:38:52.936 --> 00:38:55.147
The delivery man said
he didn't know either.

00:38:56.356 --> 00:38:57.357
Okay.

00:39:09.536 --> 00:39:12.122
How's the treatment?

00:39:12.205 --> 00:39:15.083
I was wondering
why you wanted the drug so secretly.

00:39:16.751 --> 00:39:18.253
Why don't you answer your phone?

00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:28.305
Kim Doo-jin?

00:39:29.681 --> 00:39:30.515
What?

00:39:32.517 --> 00:39:33.602
Is it good? You don't share.

00:39:35.937 --> 00:39:37.772
Do you want one? It'll wake you up.

00:39:37.856 --> 00:39:40.442
Did it wake you up? Come here.

00:39:43.570 --> 00:39:45.113
Yes, sir.

00:39:46.031 --> 00:39:48.617
Your article has a unique photo.

00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:51.369
Where did you find such a sneaky photo?

00:39:51.453 --> 00:39:52.913
I searched tenaciously.

00:40:03.173 --> 00:40:05.383
It sounds a bit like
you want to chew me up…

00:40:05.467 --> 00:40:08.011
I'm not even the department manager.
I just like these.

00:40:08.094 --> 00:40:10.680
It's good, right?
You know what is good. Damn.

00:40:10.764 --> 00:40:14.768
Yeah. Are you sure about this?
You might get a call from his agency.

00:40:14.851 --> 00:40:17.020
It's perfect
for the tax evasion suspicion.

00:40:17.562 --> 00:40:20.190
I'm glad you brought it up.
It's only a suspicion.

00:40:20.273 --> 00:40:23.735
Sir, I've looked into it already
and an accurate fact check--

00:40:23.818 --> 00:40:25.070
Hey, wait. Something's coming.

00:40:25.153 --> 00:40:27.656
Something red is approaching us.

00:40:27.739 --> 00:40:29.532
That's definitely a threat
from that distance.

00:40:29.616 --> 00:40:32.327
Kiss my ass. What, a threat?

00:40:32.410 --> 00:40:35.372
The real threat is you
harassing a junior over a photo.

00:40:35.455 --> 00:40:36.289
Right, Kim Doo-jin?

00:40:36.373 --> 00:40:38.500
You are absolutely correct.

00:40:39.709 --> 00:40:41.086
Has it ever hit you in the nose?

00:40:41.169 --> 00:40:44.422
No, does this nose look like that to you?
Look how straight it is.

00:40:45.423 --> 00:40:47.425
It looks like you had it reconstructed.

00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:50.428
It's so stressful, seriously.

00:40:50.512 --> 00:40:52.847
Stop stressing out a hardworking junior
and go.

00:40:53.473 --> 00:40:54.557
Go where?

00:40:54.641 --> 00:40:55.850
The general manager's office.

00:40:56.643 --> 00:40:58.061
You're in big trouble.

00:41:06.736 --> 00:41:09.239
What's that look on your face?
Is everything okay?

00:41:11.157 --> 00:41:12.617
I'm in good condition…

00:41:12.701 --> 00:41:16.121
Hey, if you're going to Chicago
despite that competition,

00:41:16.204 --> 00:41:18.373
you should look all cheerful and bright.

00:41:19.249 --> 00:41:22.794
You're the first to get training abroad
in the Entertainment Team.

00:41:22.877 --> 00:41:23.712
Thank you.

00:41:23.795 --> 00:41:26.881
Don't say that.
You're going because you deserve it.

00:41:26.965 --> 00:41:28.300
I have no power.

00:41:29.676 --> 00:41:33.263
Anyway, thanks to you,
Dongwoon Daily has become

00:41:33.346 --> 00:41:35.682
the go-to media outlet for actors.

00:41:36.975 --> 00:41:39.102
I'm flattered by your compliment.

00:41:39.185 --> 00:41:42.772
Hey, I'm not exaggerating. Think about it.

00:41:42.856 --> 00:41:47.777
Thanks to your article,
all the unpaid actors got paid,

00:41:47.861 --> 00:41:51.406
and that big, malicious company shut down.

00:41:51.906 --> 00:41:54.284
Our company is the number one media

00:41:54.826 --> 00:41:56.953
that the artists want to use these days.

00:41:58.496 --> 00:42:00.165
I guess I did pretty well.

00:42:01.499 --> 00:42:04.586
Keep this momentum going, okay?

00:42:04.669 --> 00:42:07.839
When you come back after a year,
write another one like that.

00:42:13.511 --> 00:42:15.388
-Where's Dong-won?
-At his friend's birthday party.

00:42:15.472 --> 00:42:18.308
Hoengseong Korean beef
lost to a bunsik party.

00:42:18.391 --> 00:42:19.517
Kids love fried chicken.

00:42:19.601 --> 00:42:20.685
Wait, it's gone.

00:42:20.769 --> 00:42:24.397
Hey, I barely chewed it, and it's gone.
It really melts.

00:42:25.106 --> 00:42:28.568
Gosh, while on a business trip,
you'd stop by Hoengseong

00:42:28.651 --> 00:42:29.986
and get beef for us.

00:42:30.070 --> 00:42:32.238
Our Jeong-min's growing up.

00:42:32.322 --> 00:42:34.657
Kyeong-do, have some. Why are you so down?

00:42:34.741 --> 00:42:38.995
You should've texted me ahead
so I wouldn't eat so much for lunch.

00:42:39.079 --> 00:42:41.414
Are you complaining
when I get this for you?

00:42:41.498 --> 00:42:43.416
Do you know
how bad the weekend traffic is?

00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:45.752
Yet I did my best to feed you.

00:42:45.835 --> 00:42:49.381
So while you were doing your best,
you could've texted me.

00:42:49.464 --> 00:42:51.508
-Don't eat it then.
-Thank you for the food.

00:42:51.591 --> 00:42:52.592
Enjoy.

00:42:54.344 --> 00:42:58.306
Oh, right. What's your plan
with your house while you're in Chicago?

00:42:58.390 --> 00:42:59.349
Why?

00:42:59.432 --> 00:43:02.644
Why bother to move out if you leave
only for a year. Why don't you sublet it?

00:43:02.727 --> 00:43:03.561
Sublet?

00:43:03.645 --> 00:43:07.482
A friend of mine works in Singapore.
And she's coming to Korea for a year.

00:43:07.565 --> 00:43:09.859
She's looking for a place to stay,
you could sublet it to her.

00:43:09.943 --> 00:43:13.780
A woman would keep the place tidy.
How much would you want?

00:43:17.242 --> 00:43:21.037
Hey, someone gets to train abroad for free
and also receive rent.

00:43:21.121 --> 00:43:24.249
It's "the poor get poorer
and the rich get richer"?

00:43:24.332 --> 00:43:25.458
Don't be silly.

00:43:27.127 --> 00:43:28.002
When are you leaving?

00:43:31.881 --> 00:43:34.551
I'm not sure yet. Eventually.

00:43:37.095 --> 00:43:38.096
Why?

00:43:38.805 --> 00:43:41.307
Now that Ji-woo's single,
you don't want to leave?

00:43:44.769 --> 00:43:47.981
What are you talking about?
What does she have to do with Chicago?

00:43:48.064 --> 00:43:51.734
Right. You should stop getting involved
with Seo Ji-woo.

00:43:51.818 --> 00:43:53.027
She's fine on her own.

00:43:53.111 --> 00:43:55.196
What do you mean she's fine?

00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:57.866
She always gets drunk
and talks about running away.

00:43:57.949 --> 00:44:00.034
And she needs to quit drinking.

00:44:00.118 --> 00:44:04.581
Besides, there's no one to stop her,
so she'll only end up drinking more.

00:44:05.748 --> 00:44:07.125
Admit it.

00:44:07.208 --> 00:44:10.879
You don't care about Chicago
because of Seo Ji-woo. Am I right?

00:44:13.131 --> 00:44:16.843
No, it's just that
she's having a hard time.

00:44:16.926 --> 00:44:21.347
And if she leaves now, her family might…
Well, you don't need to know.

00:44:21.431 --> 00:44:23.016
You need to stop!

00:44:23.099 --> 00:44:24.851
No need to raise your voice.

00:44:24.934 --> 00:44:28.855
Look at what this idiot's doing.
Because of Seo Ji-woo…

00:44:28.938 --> 00:44:33.902
I don't care about
how much you love Seo Ji-woo, but we…

00:44:34.777 --> 00:44:37.405
we also love you very much, okay?
You asshole.

00:44:45.246 --> 00:44:46.956
Why, you...

00:44:48.082 --> 00:44:49.876
Did water get you drunk?

00:44:49.959 --> 00:44:51.294
Yes, we're drinking water.

00:44:51.377 --> 00:44:54.839
With this fine food,
I can't believe we're drinking water.

00:44:55.798 --> 00:44:58.134
Do you have any idea…

00:45:00.053 --> 00:45:03.473
how much we were worried every single day
because we thought you'd die?

00:45:04.974 --> 00:45:08.228
And now you're worried
about Seo Ji-woo drinking, you jackass?

00:45:21.282 --> 00:45:26.329
WINTER, 2017

00:45:30.291 --> 00:45:31.626
Jeez.

00:45:42.637 --> 00:45:43.888
Gosh…

00:47:04.594 --> 00:47:06.054
Let's do this for this week.

00:47:08.431 --> 00:47:09.432
Okay.

00:47:12.727 --> 00:47:14.228
Gosh.

00:47:14.312 --> 00:47:15.647
-Wait, no.
-Leave it.

00:47:15.730 --> 00:47:18.733
But this is mine.
You want me to get you coffee?

00:47:20.735 --> 00:47:23.237
But it's just water.

00:47:23.321 --> 00:47:24.489
It's water…

00:47:29.494 --> 00:47:32.330
Did you request time off
just to keep drinking?

00:47:35.833 --> 00:47:38.002
I can't cause trouble at work.

00:47:38.086 --> 00:47:40.421
Hey, I'm glad you brought that up.

00:47:40.505 --> 00:47:43.508
What happened to the Culture Team's ace
Lee Kyeong-do?

00:47:43.591 --> 00:47:48.304
You worked on the forged painting scandal
for a year and shook up the art scene.

00:47:48.388 --> 00:47:50.390
I became an assistant manager
thanks to you.

00:47:50.973 --> 00:47:53.601
But why are you drinking alcohol
like water?

00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:55.520
Why, Kyeong-do?

00:48:20.837 --> 00:48:21.838
Hey, Lee Kyeong-do.

00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:33.641
I'm sorry.

00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:40.106
Han-kyeong, I'm sorry.

00:48:43.192 --> 00:48:44.193
I'm sorry.

00:48:54.912 --> 00:48:57.206
Let's go. You've had enough.

00:49:00.126 --> 00:49:02.420
Jeong-min, let's drink.

00:49:04.213 --> 00:49:05.256
Let's drink.

00:49:05.339 --> 00:49:06.382
No.

00:49:07.175 --> 00:49:10.261
-I'll pay for the chauffeur service.
-What?

00:49:15.558 --> 00:49:17.477
I'll pay, here. Drink before you go.

00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:19.812
Whatever. It's time to go now.

00:49:19.896 --> 00:49:23.483
-But it's been a while since we've met.
-Come on. Stop it.

00:49:23.566 --> 00:49:26.652
Oh, drink before you go.

00:49:27.278 --> 00:49:29.280
Oh, okay. Okay, fine.

00:49:30.448 --> 00:49:32.200
Just one bottle.

00:49:33.201 --> 00:49:34.535
Only one bottle.

00:49:34.619 --> 00:49:36.996
Only one. Okay?

00:49:37.622 --> 00:49:39.165
-Kyeong-do.
-Okay?

00:49:40.166 --> 00:49:41.501
-Hey…
-What the hell?

00:49:42.084 --> 00:49:43.002
Jeez, seriously.

00:49:43.085 --> 00:49:44.837
-Hey, I'll do it. Careful.
-Kyeong-do.

00:49:44.921 --> 00:49:47.465
Oh, wait. Get up. Jeez.

00:49:48.299 --> 00:49:51.594
Oh, seriously. Jeez, come on.

00:49:52.178 --> 00:49:54.347
Oh, I'm okay. I'm fine.

00:49:55.973 --> 00:49:57.225
Shit.

00:49:57.308 --> 00:49:59.435
Man, I fell.

00:50:00.228 --> 00:50:01.479
I'll go pay.

00:50:01.562 --> 00:50:04.899
Oh, I can get up on my own.

00:50:05.525 --> 00:50:07.443
Come to your senses, will you?

00:50:07.527 --> 00:50:10.279
-Jesus.
-I can get up.

00:50:20.832 --> 00:50:21.916
Kyeong-do!

00:50:28.714 --> 00:50:29.632
Kyeong-do.

00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:35.137
Kyeong-do, hold, hold onto me.

00:50:35.221 --> 00:50:37.139
Kyeong-do, hold onto Mommy.

00:50:37.682 --> 00:50:38.850
Oh, stop it!

00:51:17.805 --> 00:51:18.973
Your mother got hurt.

00:51:22.018 --> 00:51:23.144
Her arm's fractured.

00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:32.278
Why?

00:51:32.904 --> 00:51:35.615
She fell because her drunk son pushed her.

00:51:37.325 --> 00:51:38.576
Jeez.

00:52:02.850 --> 00:52:04.185
Kyeong-do.

00:52:27.166 --> 00:52:28.167
Mom.

00:52:39.136 --> 00:52:41.013
I'll come back after treatment.

00:52:44.475 --> 00:52:46.519
Don't worry about us.

00:52:53.776 --> 00:52:54.819
Mom.

00:52:57.154 --> 00:52:58.239
Yes.

00:53:03.369 --> 00:53:05.287
Mom, I'm sorry.

00:53:08.541 --> 00:53:09.709
I'm sorry.

00:54:22.406 --> 00:54:23.616
Jeong-min.

00:54:23.699 --> 00:54:25.659
What are you doing? This is disgusting.

00:54:26.660 --> 00:54:28.245
I'm so touched today.

00:54:29.455 --> 00:54:30.623
Speaking of which,

00:54:31.415 --> 00:54:34.418
I'm full. Can you pack my share?

00:54:36.712 --> 00:54:40.466
Se-yeong, do you have a scale?
Give him exactly 600 grams.

00:54:44.970 --> 00:54:48.015
Kiss. Kiss.

00:54:52.728 --> 00:54:56.607
I'm running an errand. Jeong-min's errand.

00:55:08.702 --> 00:55:10.913
You know Jeong-min sells used cars.

00:55:10.996 --> 00:55:13.916
He goes around the whole country.
It was Gangwon Province today.

00:55:13.999 --> 00:55:16.961
And he bought this in Hoengseong
on his way back. You know?

00:55:17.044 --> 00:55:19.046
I know he wouldn't buy enough for me.

00:55:27.471 --> 00:55:28.472
Here.

00:55:32.017 --> 00:55:33.018
Have a piece.

00:55:33.853 --> 00:55:35.146
Are you here to watch me?

00:55:35.229 --> 00:55:36.272
That too.

00:55:36.355 --> 00:55:38.023
You don't even deny it.

00:56:19.773 --> 00:56:20.816
Aren't you eating?

00:56:21.567 --> 00:56:22.401
I already did.

00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:26.906
I mean, shouldn't the one who ate
wash the dishes?

00:56:27.656 --> 00:56:31.660
She has no sense of shame. This should go…

00:56:53.515 --> 00:56:54.350
What?

00:56:56.727 --> 00:56:57.603
I'm leaving.

00:56:58.437 --> 00:57:01.649
I'll keep checking on you.
Don't even think about drinking, got it?

00:57:02.107 --> 00:57:04.401
-Are you a gangster?
-I'm a foster carer.

00:57:05.527 --> 00:57:08.280
Who asked you to foster me? Who?

00:57:09.573 --> 00:57:10.741
The past me?

00:57:13.160 --> 00:57:14.411
Wait.

00:57:15.579 --> 00:57:16.997
That was so cool.

00:57:18.916 --> 00:57:22.670
That's cool. "The past me." Ha.

00:57:31.553 --> 00:57:31.594
So it's inefficient to separate the films
from the drama?

00:57:31.594 --> 00:57:34.974
So it's inefficient to separate the films
from the drama?

00:57:35.057 --> 00:57:37.685
Yes, with the variety shows,
it separates into several parts.

00:57:37.768 --> 00:57:41.563
Then some artists would overlap.
Then the articles may overlap too.

00:57:41.647 --> 00:57:44.400
That's right. I had an interview with
actor Cho Seok-hyun for his drama,

00:57:44.483 --> 00:57:46.443
but you ran his variety article first,
remember?

00:57:46.527 --> 00:57:48.070
37°16'99.5"N 127°02'33.8"E
7:00 P.M.

00:57:48.153 --> 00:57:49.321
Remember, Kyeong-do?

00:57:51.865 --> 00:57:53.575
What's that? Latitude and longitude?

00:57:54.994 --> 00:57:58.497
So, I think it's better to assign
the artists individually.

00:57:58.580 --> 00:57:59.915
Instead of assigning by the type?

00:57:59.999 --> 00:58:03.669
Yes, while keeping up with the shows,
we'll have someone in charge of big names.

00:58:05.587 --> 00:58:09.174
Right, it's better to assign the work
in a more efficient way.

00:58:10.009 --> 00:58:13.512
Okay. That means one person
will be in charge of many.

00:58:14.179 --> 00:58:15.556
Intern, who's your favorite?

00:58:15.639 --> 00:58:16.640
JUWON UNIVERSITY FIELD

00:58:16.724 --> 00:58:18.934
Any idol is fine with me.

00:58:19.018 --> 00:58:20.311
Are you kidding me?

00:58:27.026 --> 00:58:28.610
Oh, will you stop?

00:58:28.694 --> 00:58:30.946
-What?
-Cut it out.

00:58:31.030 --> 00:58:31.905
Continue.

00:58:31.989 --> 00:58:32.823
Stop what?

00:58:32.906 --> 00:58:37.745
Then let's decide on this again
next month.

00:58:37.828 --> 00:58:39.496
Hey, block it.

00:58:39.580 --> 00:58:40.956
-Over there.
-Pass it to me.

00:58:43.500 --> 00:58:44.585
Move forward.

00:58:47.796 --> 00:58:48.797
To the left.

00:59:01.810 --> 00:59:02.811
You're late.

00:59:03.979 --> 00:59:07.024
It's hell to come here during rush hour.
Why did you call me out here?

00:59:13.405 --> 00:59:17.951
Honestly,
I wasn't sure about going to England.

00:59:19.745 --> 00:59:21.789
Even back then,
I barely plucked up my courage.

00:59:23.290 --> 00:59:25.959
When you stopped me,
I pretended to be stopped.

00:59:29.213 --> 00:59:31.465
I think it might be better to stay.

00:59:37.679 --> 00:59:39.640
But I really have to go now.

00:59:43.352 --> 00:59:45.562
Why are you drawing the wrong conclusion?

00:59:45.646 --> 00:59:47.147
Because of you.

00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:49.691
You made it clear.

00:59:51.151 --> 00:59:52.611
It's only right for me to go.

00:59:56.031 --> 00:59:58.200
I keep imagining things.

00:59:59.576 --> 01:00:03.080
All the things you say,
being sweet in a grumpy way,

01:00:03.914 --> 01:00:07.042
your support in your harsh words,
the worried look in your eyes...

01:00:08.043 --> 01:00:11.338
I can't stop giving meaning to all that.

01:00:12.673 --> 01:00:16.176
I keep picturing myself as Seo Ji-woo

01:00:18.846 --> 01:00:20.264
from Juwon University.

01:00:25.811 --> 01:00:28.063
I keep coming back here,

01:00:29.815 --> 01:00:31.567
but you're not here anymore.

01:00:41.452 --> 01:00:44.955
If you stop me again,
that means you're also confused.

01:01:46.016 --> 01:01:47.017
SPARKLING WATER

01:01:47.100 --> 01:01:48.018
ENERGY DRINK

01:02:02.908 --> 01:02:06.245
You just asked me out.
You just called me pretty.

01:02:06.328 --> 01:02:10.457
I said you had a pretty-ish face.
I didn't exactly say pretty.

01:02:10.541 --> 01:02:12.292
It was to encourage you to stop swearing.

01:02:13.418 --> 01:02:17.047
If you say things like that
without meaning them, you're a bastard.

01:02:21.468 --> 01:02:22.678
Don't be like that.

01:02:22.761 --> 01:02:24.888
You're melting my heart.

01:02:25.764 --> 01:02:26.974
I can't fall for you again.

01:02:27.057 --> 01:02:30.852
If you stop me again,
that means you're also confused.

01:03:18.483 --> 01:03:21.445
It's been a while.
You didn't change the door code?

01:03:24.823 --> 01:03:26.158
Why are you so surprised?

01:03:26.992 --> 01:03:29.202
Thought I'd still be
in the detention center?

01:03:31.163 --> 01:03:32.247
Right…

01:03:35.208 --> 01:03:37.628
Let's go outside. Let's talk outside.

01:03:37.711 --> 01:03:40.005
Oh, I'm going to leave soon. Yeah.

01:03:40.088 --> 01:03:41.840
I was just passing by,
and I thought about you.

01:03:42.507 --> 01:03:46.345
Jin-eon,
you're making me feel uncomfortable.

01:03:53.435 --> 01:03:57.648
Ji-woo, let's get back together, yes?

01:03:58.231 --> 01:04:01.610
Fine. Yeah, I admit that I cheated on you
and gave you a hard time.

01:04:02.152 --> 01:04:04.154
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry about that.

01:04:04.237 --> 01:04:06.531
I even quit doing drugs. Want to see it?

01:04:07.824 --> 01:04:11.203
Once my probation is over,
I'll be working at my father's company.

01:04:11.286 --> 01:04:15.415
I'm not even interested in JARIM.
I'm just going to start all over again.

01:04:15.499 --> 01:04:17.417
Let's start together, yes?

01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:20.128
I'm not interested either.

01:04:23.382 --> 01:04:27.719
Oh, Ji-woo. Right, Ji-woo.

01:04:27.803 --> 01:04:29.596
Yeah? Ji-woo.

01:04:30.889 --> 01:04:34.810
Ji-woo, do you think
you can have this decent life

01:04:34.893 --> 01:04:37.354
without me or my family?

01:04:39.773 --> 01:04:41.775
Ji-woo, you're…

01:04:43.318 --> 01:04:46.363
Oh, you're Cinderella in rags
after midnight. Okay?

01:04:46.988 --> 01:04:49.866
Who'd even bat an eye at you? The prince?

01:04:51.326 --> 01:04:53.036
You'll only be surrounded by rats.

01:04:54.913 --> 01:04:56.456
Okay, Ji-woo?

01:05:17.394 --> 01:05:20.313
Hey, if you just leave after saying--

01:05:34.077 --> 01:05:35.162
What is this, Ji-woo?

01:05:38.749 --> 01:05:41.418
A guest?
I only bought two servings of gimbap.

01:05:42.836 --> 01:05:45.005
Ji-woo, are you okay?

01:05:45.088 --> 01:05:46.798
Why are you standing there
like a soaked puppy?

01:06:01.354 --> 01:06:05.108
You're that man in the picture. Shit.

01:06:05.192 --> 01:06:08.570
Don't you think it's a little too late
to have a guest?

01:06:08.653 --> 01:06:09.863
It seems you are the guest.

01:06:10.781 --> 01:06:14.242
What's going on with luggage at this hour?
What's going on, Ji-woo?

01:06:15.327 --> 01:06:18.079
You should look at me.
You were talking to me.

01:06:23.877 --> 01:06:25.545
What is going on?

01:06:37.557 --> 01:06:40.769
I'm flirting with her.
And I'm doing my best.

01:06:53.824 --> 01:06:57.744
SURELY TOMORROW

01:07:15.178 --> 01:07:16.012
Jeez.

01:07:19.516 --> 01:07:26.231
CLOTHING COLLECTION BOX

01:07:29.317 --> 01:07:32.487
Shoot. What the heck? Why is it so deep?

01:07:43.415 --> 01:07:45.125
Dad, can you overlock stitch this?

01:07:46.793 --> 01:07:48.461
Hey, even your mom wouldn't wear this.

01:07:48.545 --> 01:07:51.381
Jeez, throw it out.

01:07:51.464 --> 01:07:53.216
Why mend it when it's already gone?

01:07:53.300 --> 01:07:56.052
Mom, you've changed.
Being frugal is the key to wealth.

01:07:56.136 --> 01:07:59.681
That's not being frugal.
That's pitiful. Throw it out already.

01:07:59.764 --> 01:08:01.975
No! This is basically my security blanket.

01:08:02.058 --> 01:08:03.059
Your security blanket?

01:08:04.185 --> 01:08:05.312
That's crazy.

01:08:05.395 --> 01:08:08.189
Then get married! You're getting weird.

01:08:08.899 --> 01:08:10.525
Crazy?
I'm going to a different laundromat.

01:08:10.609 --> 01:08:13.737
SOMANG LAUNDROMAT

01:08:13.820 --> 01:08:16.114
Did I not breastfeed him enough?

01:08:16.197 --> 01:08:18.408
How can he have a security blanket
at this age?

01:08:51.733 --> 01:08:53.860
Let's sleep together. The bed is big.

01:08:54.361 --> 01:08:57.364
If you come here again after work,
you're a dead man.

01:08:58.114 --> 01:09:00.450
Are you crazy?

01:09:00.533 --> 01:09:03.328
I went all the way there. Was she
flirting with me or threatening me?

01:09:03.411 --> 01:09:04.537
Have you done it?

01:09:04.621 --> 01:09:05.997
All right. Let's go.

01:09:08.375 --> 01:09:09.209
Kyeong-do.

01:09:09.292 --> 01:09:11.711
I'll leave when you become
a decent human being. Say no more.

01:09:14.714 --> 01:09:18.009
I know this is shameless,
but it's good to be with you.

01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:23.932
How long will I be in love with you?
