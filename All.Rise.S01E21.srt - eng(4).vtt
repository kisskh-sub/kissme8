(Talent Hunt Program Day 67)

00:01:50.024 --> 00:01:52.040
(Guo Xiaoyu 3, Yan Fei 2)

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.864
(Ren Jiatong 1, Jiang Chen 1)

00:01:55.048 --> 00:01:55.688
Have you heard?

00:01:56.067 --> 00:01:57.787
The client Ms. Bai just met with

00:01:57.986 --> 00:01:59.227
is her ex-boyfriend.

00:01:59.707 --> 00:02:01.186
And this guy came to see Ms. Bai

00:02:01.386 --> 00:02:02.986
to help his current girlfriend.

00:02:03.707 --> 00:02:05.067
I'm so furious!

00:02:05.307 --> 00:02:06.986
What's wrong with these men?

00:02:07.027 --> 00:02:08.186
Are they all heartless?

00:02:10.547 --> 00:02:12.746
Maybe you should add a prerequisite

00:02:13.027 --> 00:02:14.387
to your conclusion.

00:02:14.666 --> 00:02:15.786
Let's be more rigorous.

00:02:15.827 --> 00:02:16.946
Don't target the innocent.

00:02:23.346 --> 00:02:24.488
I'm being quite rigorous.

00:02:27.666 --> 00:02:28.987
I didn't misjudge any bad man.

00:02:32.107 --> 00:02:33.626
I'm just so mad.

00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:36.186
I don't think
Ms. Bai will take this case.

00:02:36.267 --> 00:02:38.027
It's generous
that she didn't kick him out.

00:02:38.226 --> 00:02:40.587
But my gut feeling is
Ms. Bai will take the case.

00:02:41.427 --> 00:02:42.587
I also think so.

00:02:43.346 --> 00:02:45.346
Ms. Bai doesn't
let emotions affect her work.

00:02:45.827 --> 00:02:47.666
This isn't about emotions.

00:02:47.666 --> 00:02:48.987
It's about basic self-respect.

00:02:49.346 --> 00:02:49.946
Think about it.

00:02:50.107 --> 00:02:52.147
Since her divorce,

00:02:52.267 --> 00:02:54.466
he's the only boyfriend
Ms. Bai has ever acknowledged.

00:02:54.466 --> 00:02:56.147
She almost committed to him.

00:02:56.346 --> 00:02:57.387
I don't know exactly why

00:02:57.387 --> 00:02:58.307
they broke up later,

00:02:58.506 --> 00:03:00.987
but I'd guess that in Ms. Bai's heart,

00:03:01.186 --> 00:03:03.107
he probably meant more than my idol.

00:03:04.107 --> 00:03:06.626
I bet you 100 yuan. She won't take it.

00:03:14.027 --> 00:03:16.506
What are you discussing?
Not at your desk

00:03:16.506 --> 00:03:17.387
and already slacking?

00:03:18.267 --> 00:03:19.346
Let me say something here.

00:03:20.226 --> 00:03:22.027
Ms. Bai has taken on the bribery case

00:03:22.027 --> 00:03:23.746
involving Xia Jun at Mr. Gao's request.

00:03:24.906 --> 00:03:25.626
I'll send you

00:03:25.786 --> 00:03:27.267
case files and assignments shortly.

00:03:27.466 --> 00:03:29.107
Get familiar with the case immediately.

00:03:29.147 --> 00:03:30.027
Finish it promptly.

00:03:30.466 --> 00:03:31.186
But

00:03:31.186 --> 00:03:32.707
their connections are tangled,

00:03:32.987 --> 00:03:33.626
being coworkers,

00:03:33.626 --> 00:03:34.666
client and contractor,

00:03:34.867 --> 00:03:36.267
and exes. It's complicated.

00:03:36.267 --> 00:03:36.906
Enough.

00:03:38.066 --> 00:03:38.666
Ms. Guo,

00:03:39.147 --> 00:03:40.147
we're a Red Circle Firm,

00:03:40.186 --> 00:03:41.147
not a matchmaker.

00:03:41.906 --> 00:03:43.387
Stop analyzing relationships.

00:03:44.307 --> 00:03:44.666
Okay.

00:03:45.147 --> 00:03:45.946
Keep work as work

00:03:46.267 --> 00:03:46.946
and love as love.

00:03:47.506 --> 00:03:48.267
Don't mix the two.

00:03:49.506 --> 00:03:51.626
Guo Xiaoyu, Ren Jiatong,
go find Ms. Tian.

00:03:52.147 --> 00:03:53.267
Meet the client with her

00:03:53.387 --> 00:03:54.506
and get more case details.

00:03:55.147 --> 00:03:57.267
Jiang Chen, Yan Fei,
send me the key points

00:03:57.267 --> 00:03:58.792
from Xia Jun's internal report soon.

00:04:05.346 --> 00:04:07.466
Mr. Zhou, she might get
some urgent work to do.

00:04:10.626 --> 00:04:11.387
Get back to work.

00:04:13.626 --> 00:04:14.312
Give me 100 yuan.

00:04:14.547 --> 00:04:14.867
Shut up.

00:04:38.986 --> 00:04:39.426
Yan Fei,

00:04:40.466 --> 00:04:42.507
no rush on your report.
Tomorrow is fine.

00:04:44.187 --> 00:04:44.507
Okay.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.312
(When are you coming back?)

00:06:11.466 --> 00:06:12.666
Here. Have some water.

00:06:13.906 --> 00:06:15.786
Your girlfriend didn't
come train with you?

00:06:16.187 --> 00:06:17.106
Not my girlfriend.

00:06:17.707 --> 00:06:18.426
We are colleagues.

00:06:33.106 --> 00:06:35.106
I just met Xia Jun with Guo Xiaoyu.

00:06:35.426 --> 00:06:37.346
She admitted recommending introduction

00:06:37.346 --> 00:06:39.666
of the outsourcing software company
at their request,

00:06:39.666 --> 00:06:40.587
but denied bribery.

00:06:40.906 --> 00:06:41.866
But they insisted

00:06:41.866 --> 00:06:43.627
they gave her
two million cash personally,

00:06:43.827 --> 00:06:45.306
with times, locations, and witnesses.

00:06:45.666 --> 00:06:47.306
Their internal investigation report

00:06:47.387 --> 00:06:49.747
listed several locations where they met,

00:06:50.067 --> 00:06:51.986
including a seafood restaurant
and a pub.

00:06:52.267 --> 00:06:54.507
But Xia Jun claimed she has
severe seafood allergy.

00:06:54.587 --> 00:06:56.507
She'd never meet
at a seafood restaurant.

00:06:56.906 --> 00:06:58.627
So they're probably lying.

00:06:59.387 --> 00:06:59.986
I'm on it.

00:07:00.747 --> 00:07:02.666
I'll visit

00:07:02.747 --> 00:07:03.627
all those places

00:07:03.627 --> 00:07:05.587
and see if I'd have any chance

00:07:05.587 --> 00:07:06.546
to check footage.

00:07:07.106 --> 00:07:08.546
I'll update you if I find anything.

00:07:09.666 --> 00:07:10.027
Okay.

00:07:14.306 --> 00:07:15.080
Have you eaten?

00:07:16.786 --> 00:07:17.587
Xiaoyu is cooking.

00:07:18.827 --> 00:07:19.587
I'm also hungry.

00:07:23.546 --> 00:07:28.226
It depends on your performance.
If you find solid evidence,

00:07:28.707 --> 00:07:30.440
we'll save you a bite
for a midnight snack.

00:07:32.747 --> 00:07:34.986
What if I can't find anything?

00:07:37.627 --> 00:07:38.866
Then I'll be merciful

00:07:39.346 --> 00:07:40.387
and grab some with you.

00:07:42.226 --> 00:07:42.546
Deal.

00:07:43.466 --> 00:07:44.584
Jiatong, noodles are ready.

00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:47.027
Talk later.

00:07:49.627 --> 00:07:50.147
Who is it?

00:07:53.147 --> 00:07:53.747
Jiang Chen.

00:07:54.507 --> 00:07:55.707
I've updated them

00:07:55.707 --> 00:07:56.947
with today's information.

00:07:56.947 --> 00:07:57.906
Yan Fei hasn't replied.

00:07:57.906 --> 00:07:59.187
Jiang Chen called me back.

00:08:03.587 --> 00:08:04.707
He didn't say anything else?

00:08:07.627 --> 00:08:08.106
No.

00:08:16.507 --> 00:08:16.906
Jiatong,

00:08:19.147 --> 00:08:20.507
we're best friends.

00:08:21.866 --> 00:08:23.786
There's something I have to tell you.

00:08:26.187 --> 00:08:26.947
What is it?

00:08:26.947 --> 00:08:27.747
So mysterious.

00:08:31.906 --> 00:08:32.546
I think

00:08:33.227 --> 00:08:35.946
Yan Fei and Jiang Chen have
something going on.

00:08:40.147 --> 00:08:41.267
What could be going on?

00:08:41.467 --> 00:08:42.826
What else could it possibly be?

00:08:42.826 --> 00:08:44.186
Are you an idiot? Think about it.

00:08:44.627 --> 00:08:46.027
How we obsess over couples?

00:08:46.467 --> 00:08:48.666
We examine every little detail
with a magnifying glass.

00:08:48.747 --> 00:08:50.467
At the slightest hint,

00:08:50.546 --> 00:08:52.027
we'll imagine an entire love story.

00:08:52.507 --> 00:08:53.027
Listen.

00:08:53.306 --> 00:08:53.747
Lately,

00:08:54.267 --> 00:08:55.546
whenever I post on Moments,

00:08:55.546 --> 00:08:56.586
Jiang Chen likes it.

00:08:56.786 --> 00:08:58.066
He never liked my posts before.

00:08:58.867 --> 00:08:59.586
Do you know why?

00:09:00.306 --> 00:09:00.946
Why?

00:09:02.387 --> 00:09:02.987
I bet

00:09:04.107 --> 00:09:06.027
it's because I'm close friends
with Yan Fei.

00:09:07.867 --> 00:09:09.387
This is all way too suspicious.

00:09:10.387 --> 00:09:12.347
Last time, I posted our group photo.

00:09:12.586 --> 00:09:13.507
He liked it again,

00:09:14.347 --> 00:09:16.467
just because Yan Fei was standing
in the middle.

00:09:19.507 --> 00:09:21.107
I didn't want to tell you any of this.

00:09:22.306 --> 00:09:22.946
I'm just afraid

00:09:23.747 --> 00:09:24.786
you would get hurt.

00:09:26.306 --> 00:09:27.906
How could I possibly get hurt?

00:09:30.826 --> 00:09:32.586
Alright. Good that you're
taking this well.

00:09:34.066 --> 00:09:34.867
Don't blame Yan Fei.

00:09:35.186 --> 00:09:36.467
Blame that fool Jiang Chen.

00:09:37.147 --> 00:09:37.666
Listen.

00:09:38.347 --> 00:09:40.267
Guys can change their feelings
in an instant.

00:09:40.747 --> 00:09:41.747
You think you are close,

00:09:41.826 --> 00:09:42.987
yet suddenly, he changes.

00:09:45.186 --> 00:09:45.946
Several days ago,

00:09:46.107 --> 00:09:47.786
I saw an image on Yiaiwan's

00:09:47.786 --> 00:09:48.586
beta testing site.

00:09:49.387 --> 00:09:50.627
Though anonymously posted,

00:09:50.627 --> 00:09:51.906
it must be Zhu Zhisheng's work.

00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:54.306
Look at this username.

00:09:54.867 --> 00:09:55.867
Rain1016.

00:09:56.867 --> 00:09:57.666
That's my birthday.

00:09:59.867 --> 00:10:01.107
When he made this image,

00:10:02.066 --> 00:10:04.107
he must have been daydreaming
about our future.

00:10:07.706 --> 00:10:08.387
Xiaoyu,

00:10:09.027 --> 00:10:11.066
you haven't moved on from Zhu Zhisheng?

00:10:15.227 --> 00:10:16.186
Honestly, I don't know.

00:10:17.906 --> 00:10:19.267
Since I returned from Hangzhou,

00:10:19.507 --> 00:10:20.666
I keep telling myself daily

00:10:21.387 --> 00:10:22.586
that I must let it go.

00:10:23.387 --> 00:10:24.666
He's just some guy.

00:10:24.666 --> 00:10:25.946
Just four years of relationship.

00:10:26.306 --> 00:10:27.867
No big deal, right?

00:10:28.546 --> 00:10:30.306
I don't care at all.

00:10:30.306 --> 00:10:31.747
I'll totally forget it.

00:10:33.546 --> 00:10:34.627
But sometimes,

00:10:35.347 --> 00:10:36.306
with just a random song,

00:10:37.227 --> 00:10:38.147
a familiar scent,

00:10:39.107 --> 00:10:40.306
or even certain clothes,

00:10:41.227 --> 00:10:42.107
just by seeing it,

00:10:42.107 --> 00:10:44.027
my heart hurts badly like it's been

00:10:44.027 --> 00:10:44.867
punctured.

00:10:46.107 --> 00:10:48.066
But when I saw that image recently,

00:10:48.627 --> 00:10:49.706
I suddenly realized

00:10:51.786 --> 00:10:54.747
maybe dating is just like
playing video games.

00:10:55.467 --> 00:10:56.627
Sometimes you play for hours,

00:10:57.507 --> 00:10:58.666
but forget to save progress.

00:10:59.306 --> 00:11:01.066
All that hard-earned gear disappears.

00:11:02.027 --> 00:11:02.987
Or even worse,

00:11:03.186 --> 00:11:04.107
you lose your account.

00:11:05.387 --> 00:11:05.786
Tell me.

00:11:06.627 --> 00:11:07.387
In cases like that,

00:11:08.306 --> 00:11:09.586
does that make it all pointless?

00:11:13.306 --> 00:11:14.306
Definitely not.

00:11:15.426 --> 00:11:17.627
Because I truly experienced

00:11:17.627 --> 00:11:19.387
the highs and lows during gameplay.

00:11:19.946 --> 00:11:20.786
Those feelings

00:11:21.227 --> 00:11:22.906
aren't tied to anyone else.

00:11:23.227 --> 00:11:24.426
They belong to me alone.

00:11:26.586 --> 00:11:27.627
I just want to tell you.

00:11:28.147 --> 00:11:28.507
Jiatong,

00:11:29.906 --> 00:11:30.906
whatever we go through,

00:11:32.066 --> 00:11:33.586
let's never lose faith in love.

00:11:37.747 --> 00:11:39.627
Xiaoyu, you're amazing.

00:11:40.426 --> 00:11:40.906
Jiatong,

00:11:41.627 --> 00:11:43.627
this is the first time
you hugged me first.

00:11:53.147 --> 00:11:54.186
If you're feeling down,

00:11:54.747 --> 00:11:55.227
it's okay.

00:11:55.786 --> 00:11:57.426
Talk to me. I understand.

00:12:02.786 --> 00:12:03.147
Okay.

00:12:09.867 --> 00:12:11.066
Earlier, Guo Xiaoyu was

00:12:11.066 --> 00:12:12.747
having serious analysis.

00:12:13.027 --> 00:12:13.826
I'm torn

00:12:14.066 --> 00:12:16.546
about whether to tell her or not.

00:12:17.627 --> 00:12:18.987
I'm also afraid that someday

00:12:18.987 --> 00:12:20.227
she'll find out and be mad.

00:12:21.227 --> 00:12:21.627
Oh, no!

00:12:22.426 --> 00:12:24.426
I think I missed the best time
to confess.

00:12:25.027 --> 00:12:25.747
So what now?

00:12:25.946 --> 00:12:28.066
How about going for leniency now?

00:12:28.867 --> 00:12:29.987
Well, there's another way.

00:12:30.706 --> 00:12:31.227
What is it?

00:12:32.867 --> 00:12:34.227
We can just stop all contact.

00:12:37.387 --> 00:12:40.107
Ren Jiatong, you...
Good thing you're not a judge.

00:12:40.107 --> 00:12:41.906
You'd cause so many
wrongful convictions.

00:12:42.387 --> 00:12:43.426
I can't even imagine.

00:12:43.786 --> 00:12:44.706
What did I do?

00:12:44.706 --> 00:12:46.227
You're sacrificing me.

00:12:46.586 --> 00:12:47.306
I won't accept it.

00:12:47.387 --> 00:12:48.306
I'm innocent.

00:12:48.627 --> 00:12:49.627
I want to appeal.

00:12:50.627 --> 00:12:51.586
Alright, alright.

00:12:51.706 --> 00:12:53.267
I restore your innocence.

00:12:54.867 --> 00:12:55.706
That's more like it.

00:12:57.586 --> 00:12:59.867
Should we do something for Mr. Zhou

00:13:00.507 --> 00:13:01.107
and Yan Fei?

00:13:01.987 --> 00:13:03.147
Since you brought it up,

00:13:03.147 --> 00:13:04.387
you must have a plan.

00:13:04.627 --> 00:13:05.227
Tell me.

00:13:05.987 --> 00:13:06.747
I have no plan.

00:13:07.107 --> 00:13:08.826
How could I have a plan
for their romance?

00:13:09.706 --> 00:13:11.107
But I do have invited Mr. Zhou

00:13:11.107 --> 00:13:12.027
to investigate later.

00:13:12.666 --> 00:13:14.107
I'll see how he's doing then.

00:13:14.507 --> 00:13:16.347
If he's completely heartless,

00:13:16.347 --> 00:13:17.586
let's just drop it.

00:13:18.347 --> 00:13:19.666
Yan Fei is so proud.

00:13:19.706 --> 00:13:21.384
She'd feel bad
if we kept bringing it up.

00:13:21.747 --> 00:13:22.826
You sure know Yan Fei well.

00:13:27.546 --> 00:13:28.906
Who spilled the vinegar?

00:13:29.507 --> 00:13:30.627
Smells jealous in here!

00:13:32.627 --> 00:13:33.306
Just go!

00:13:33.507 --> 00:13:33.987
And then?

00:13:34.507 --> 00:13:35.227
Come right back.

00:13:37.147 --> 00:13:37.507
Got it!

00:13:51.946 --> 00:13:52.546
Just off work?

00:13:53.747 --> 00:13:54.107
Mr. Song,

00:13:54.267 --> 00:13:55.147
working this late too?

00:13:56.987 --> 00:13:58.027
Are you settling back in

00:13:58.387 --> 00:13:58.906
with Ms. Bai?

00:14:00.426 --> 00:14:01.186
It's manageable.

00:14:01.186 --> 00:14:02.426
I've been supporting Ms. Bai

00:14:02.426 --> 00:14:03.306
with that new case.

00:14:05.627 --> 00:14:07.387
Ms. Bai mentioned it to me.

00:14:08.627 --> 00:14:09.347
How's it going?

00:14:09.747 --> 00:14:10.946
Mr. Zhou and I plan

00:14:10.946 --> 00:14:11.987
to inspect those locations

00:14:11.987 --> 00:14:13.066
listed in the internal

00:14:13.066 --> 00:14:14.666
investigation report,

00:14:14.946 --> 00:14:16.347
and look for potential clues.

00:14:17.706 --> 00:14:18.728
Haven't eaten yet?

00:14:20.227 --> 00:14:21.987
Grab something downstairs on your way,

00:14:21.987 --> 00:14:22.666
and eat a bit.

00:14:23.147 --> 00:14:24.347
Health comes first.

00:14:25.227 --> 00:14:26.267
Also, let me remind you.

00:14:27.546 --> 00:14:29.066
Ms. Bai takes this case seriously.

00:14:29.467 --> 00:14:31.592
If there's anything,
report to her immediately.

00:14:33.987 --> 00:14:34.627
I heard...

00:14:36.147 --> 00:14:37.027
I just heard

00:14:37.107 --> 00:14:37.867
that this case

00:14:38.666 --> 00:14:40.507
was brought by Ms. Bai's ex-boyfriend.

00:14:41.347 --> 00:14:43.147
And it's actually
for his current girlfriend.

00:14:44.387 --> 00:14:45.960
The relationships are too complicated.

00:14:46.227 --> 00:14:47.867
We were just talking this afternoon

00:14:48.147 --> 00:14:49.906
that he's treating Ms. Bai
way too casually.

00:14:50.267 --> 00:14:51.387
It's also awkward for us.

00:14:51.706 --> 00:14:53.387
Actually, I think it shows

00:14:53.387 --> 00:14:54.546
Ms. Bai has great judgment.

00:14:54.786 --> 00:14:55.706
She saw him right.

00:14:56.227 --> 00:14:57.666
He came to Jun An for Ms. Bai.

00:14:58.147 --> 00:14:59.107
It shows that he thinks

00:14:59.467 --> 00:15:00.786
Ms. Bai is the best lawyer.

00:15:02.467 --> 00:15:03.666
Though feelings may fade,

00:15:04.227 --> 00:15:05.227
admiration and respect

00:15:05.987 --> 00:15:06.586
endure.

00:15:07.627 --> 00:15:08.706
You're brilliant, Mr. Song.

00:15:09.826 --> 00:15:10.627
You know Ms. Bai,

00:15:11.627 --> 00:15:12.347
and opponents too.

00:15:13.627 --> 00:15:14.946
Who told you we're opponents?

00:15:15.426 --> 00:15:16.147
Let me remind you.

00:15:16.666 --> 00:15:17.387
At our law firm,

00:15:17.946 --> 00:15:19.706
we already have a gossip expert,
Guo Xiaoyu.

00:15:20.107 --> 00:15:20.586
Stay away.

00:15:30.267 --> 00:15:30.666
Mr. Song,

00:15:31.147 --> 00:15:32.826
does our firm really have the rule

00:15:32.987 --> 00:15:35.027
that colleagues can't date each other?

00:15:37.306 --> 00:15:38.507
I'm just being nosy.

00:15:42.147 --> 00:15:43.048
Here's the thing.

00:15:44.027 --> 00:15:45.027
At our firm,

00:15:45.107 --> 00:15:46.747
we genuinely discourage

00:15:46.786 --> 00:15:49.147
developing overly complicated
emotional relationships.

00:15:49.546 --> 00:15:50.826
But personally,

00:15:51.306 --> 00:15:52.507
I don't encourage young people

00:15:52.906 --> 00:15:54.107
to do things they'll regret.

00:15:55.627 --> 00:15:57.066
If you did something regrettable,

00:15:57.066 --> 00:15:58.627
would you tell her?

00:16:02.426 --> 00:16:03.186
We're all adults.

00:16:03.747 --> 00:16:04.507
Some things go

00:16:05.186 --> 00:16:05.786
without saying.

00:16:06.347 --> 00:16:06.987
We both know.

00:16:09.347 --> 00:16:11.107
Legally speaking,

00:16:11.186 --> 00:16:13.267
the intent means the internal intent

00:16:13.387 --> 00:16:14.987
must combine with external expression.

00:16:15.107 --> 00:16:17.027
Internal intents
without external expression

00:16:17.027 --> 00:16:18.147
have no legal effect.

00:16:18.586 --> 00:16:19.306
So I think

00:16:19.467 --> 00:16:21.306
that unspoken emotions

00:16:22.387 --> 00:16:23.586
aren't necessarily known.

00:16:28.186 --> 00:16:29.867
I'm here, Mr. Song. See you tomorrow.

00:16:50.666 --> 00:16:51.066
Mr. Zhou.

00:16:52.826 --> 00:16:53.387
I'm so sorry.

00:16:53.586 --> 00:16:54.706
Beijing's traffic is just...

00:16:54.987 --> 00:16:55.467
It's fine.

00:16:55.826 --> 00:16:56.786
I've seen the footage.

00:16:57.186 --> 00:16:58.066
And I recorded it.

00:16:58.507 --> 00:16:59.586
- I'll send it to you.
- Okay.

00:17:00.627 --> 00:17:01.666
When I finish the report,

00:17:01.666 --> 00:17:03.267
I'll send it to you and Ms. Bai.

00:17:10.786 --> 00:17:13.146
- Treat you to dinner?
- What about the report?

00:17:13.947 --> 00:17:14.826
Dinner matters more.

00:17:14.907 --> 00:17:15.866
I'm hungry.

00:17:16.586 --> 00:17:17.947
I've been meaning to find time

00:17:17.947 --> 00:17:18.907
to tell you a story

00:17:19.386 --> 00:17:22.146
about Moments and a certain hand.

00:17:24.626 --> 00:17:25.626
You asked for it.

00:17:27.507 --> 00:17:29.707
♪Tears fall♪

00:17:30.146 --> 00:17:32.187
♪Emotions scattered♪

00:17:36.586 --> 00:17:38.546
Mr. Zhou, what's going on with us?

00:17:38.546 --> 00:17:40.907
How did we both get stuck in romance?

00:17:42.066 --> 00:17:43.427
You're my mentor.

00:17:43.826 --> 00:17:45.066
It's your duty to explain.

00:17:47.826 --> 00:17:49.306
Learning from me? Don't ask me.

00:17:50.427 --> 00:17:51.546
When it comes to romance,

00:17:51.786 --> 00:17:52.826
I'm completely clueless.

00:17:54.106 --> 00:17:54.467
Fine.

00:17:55.427 --> 00:17:57.146
Then you should tell me

00:17:57.146 --> 00:17:58.707
when things started with Yan Fei.

00:18:01.586 --> 00:18:02.747
Nothing started.

00:18:08.467 --> 00:18:09.146
I don't know

00:18:09.146 --> 00:18:10.467
when I started liking her.

00:18:11.427 --> 00:18:12.667
At first, I thought she was

00:18:13.346 --> 00:18:15.106
kind of a spoiled rich girl.

00:18:16.467 --> 00:18:17.786
Her family is a client of Jun An.

00:18:18.747 --> 00:18:19.626
I couldn't offend her.

00:18:19.947 --> 00:18:20.826
So I was polite.

00:18:22.106 --> 00:18:23.187
But gradually, I realized

00:18:24.467 --> 00:18:25.747
she's actually a very kind

00:18:25.987 --> 00:18:27.066
and warm-hearted girl.

00:18:28.187 --> 00:18:29.187
She's straightforward.

00:18:30.027 --> 00:18:32.146
But she genuinely helps
when people need her.

00:18:35.427 --> 00:18:37.747
I don't even know if this counts

00:18:39.227 --> 00:18:40.306
as liking her.

00:18:41.467 --> 00:18:42.227
But she really is

00:18:43.346 --> 00:18:44.066
different.

00:18:44.586 --> 00:18:45.146
Different?

00:18:45.987 --> 00:18:46.747
That's not liking.

00:18:47.467 --> 00:18:49.066
That's love. Definitely love.

00:18:50.786 --> 00:18:51.586
Whatever it is,

00:18:53.667 --> 00:18:55.146
I have to suppress the feelings.

00:18:55.907 --> 00:18:57.507
Because as of this moment,

00:18:57.866 --> 00:18:59.027
I'm still your mentor.

00:18:59.707 --> 00:19:01.027
If my feelings for her

00:19:01.987 --> 00:19:02.826
cause even

00:19:02.826 --> 00:19:05.227
the slightest bias in my heart,

00:19:05.747 --> 00:19:07.427
that would be unfair to all of you.

00:19:09.707 --> 00:19:10.546
If we got together,

00:19:11.386 --> 00:19:13.707
and I revealed anything
intentionally or accidentally,

00:19:13.947 --> 00:19:15.306
or if I paid her too much

00:19:16.066 --> 00:19:16.707
attention

00:19:17.187 --> 00:19:18.786
and affected the program's fairness,

00:19:19.306 --> 00:19:20.306
I would betray

00:19:20.306 --> 00:19:22.586
Mr. Zhuang, Mr. Song,
and Ms. Bai's trust in me.

00:19:22.987 --> 00:19:24.456
It would also betray my profession.

00:19:24.947 --> 00:19:26.386
So I have to be professional.

00:19:30.707 --> 00:19:32.667
What about
after the Talent Hunt Program ends?

00:19:33.786 --> 00:19:35.146
I haven't thought about it.

00:19:38.346 --> 00:19:39.947
Mr. Song just told me

00:19:40.826 --> 00:19:42.747
we should not have regrets.

00:19:44.066 --> 00:19:45.747
You should stand firm when necessary.

00:19:47.267 --> 00:19:48.467
I think he's right.

00:19:50.826 --> 00:19:51.866
I know what you mean.

00:19:53.066 --> 00:19:53.586
But Chen,

00:19:56.146 --> 00:19:57.187
the gap between my family

00:19:57.987 --> 00:19:59.227
and hers,

00:19:59.546 --> 00:20:00.424
I'm not exaggerating,

00:20:01.947 --> 00:20:03.066
is like the Mariana Trench

00:20:03.667 --> 00:20:04.786
to Mount Everest.

00:20:06.187 --> 00:20:07.227
Nonsense.

00:20:07.227 --> 00:20:08.947
Who even cares
about these things nowadays?

00:20:09.507 --> 00:20:10.866
At least, Yan Fei

00:20:10.866 --> 00:20:12.546
would never care about stuff like that.

00:20:13.066 --> 00:20:14.467
Then what would her parents think?

00:20:16.947 --> 00:20:17.626
Freedom in dating

00:20:18.187 --> 00:20:18.786
and marriage

00:20:18.786 --> 00:20:20.306
is protected by law.

00:20:20.546 --> 00:20:23.346
Besides the law, there's also
human connection.

00:20:25.467 --> 00:20:26.467
We're humans first,

00:20:27.187 --> 00:20:28.306
and then lawyers.

00:20:29.987 --> 00:20:31.667
Hey, check the message.

00:20:31.667 --> 00:20:33.066
You didn't reply to my message.

00:20:33.826 --> 00:20:35.346
How much longer for your report?

00:20:36.786 --> 00:20:38.507
I'm outside. I haven't checked my phone.

00:20:39.227 --> 00:20:40.427
I'll send it to you later.

00:20:40.907 --> 00:20:41.707
Within an hour.

00:20:42.626 --> 00:20:44.106
Okay, take care then.

00:20:46.106 --> 00:20:47.866
Why do I hear trucks from your side?

00:20:47.866 --> 00:20:48.586
Where are you?

00:20:50.667 --> 00:20:52.546
Outside the Fifth Ring Road, stargazing.

00:20:52.947 --> 00:20:54.027
It's too overcast today.

00:20:54.027 --> 00:20:54.786
Nothing visible.

00:20:55.866 --> 00:20:58.306
But five big trucks
have already passed by.

00:20:58.427 --> 00:20:59.747
I'm covered in dust.

00:21:00.626 --> 00:21:01.866
No stars tonight.

00:21:02.267 --> 00:21:04.360
Because the one who
accompanied you didn't come.

00:21:06.066 --> 00:21:08.346
I joined the astronomy club as a kid.

00:21:08.667 --> 00:21:11.507
Besides, I've got a whole
telescope setup at home.

00:21:12.027 --> 00:21:13.626
Can't I just come stargazing alone?

00:21:14.027 --> 00:21:14.667
Of course.

00:21:15.267 --> 00:21:16.306
I just wanted to tell you

00:21:17.507 --> 00:21:18.507
just the other day,

00:21:19.586 --> 00:21:22.066
I witnessed a certain lawyer

00:21:22.427 --> 00:21:24.146
holding his phone,

00:21:24.146 --> 00:21:25.467
scrolling through

00:21:26.467 --> 00:21:27.907
someone's Moments,

00:21:28.546 --> 00:21:29.987
zooming in and out.

00:21:30.707 --> 00:21:32.507
That was way more interesting
than stargazing.

00:21:33.227 --> 00:21:33.626
Really?

00:21:35.267 --> 00:21:35.707
Who was it?

00:21:39.626 --> 00:21:40.747
You want the report?

00:21:41.146 --> 00:21:42.187
I'll deliver it now.

00:21:47.306 --> 00:21:49.306
Then at least,
after the Talent Hunt Program,

00:21:49.306 --> 00:21:51.626
you should tell Yan Fei how you feel.

00:21:52.227 --> 00:21:54.907
Holding back like this can't be right.

00:21:56.467 --> 00:21:57.546
She doesn't need to know.

00:21:57.546 --> 00:21:58.707
She has the right to know!

00:21:59.386 --> 00:21:59.866
What then?

00:22:01.106 --> 00:22:03.227
There's a huge gap between our families.

00:22:03.786 --> 00:22:05.507
Telling her would only cause her stress.

00:22:05.507 --> 00:22:06.786
What if her family approves?

00:22:06.786 --> 00:22:07.626
Even if they do,

00:22:08.747 --> 00:22:11.586
our working relationship,
the family gap,

00:22:11.586 --> 00:22:13.306
my wish to work in Hangzhou,

00:22:13.507 --> 00:22:15.306
and her vision for her future,

00:22:16.027 --> 00:22:17.267
all these practical issues

00:22:17.267 --> 00:22:19.146
would become problems for us.

00:22:20.306 --> 00:22:20.667
I am

00:22:21.947 --> 00:22:23.907
a man about to turn thirty.

00:22:24.786 --> 00:22:25.826
My family's just ordinary.

00:22:27.027 --> 00:22:28.066
In my life,

00:22:28.987 --> 00:22:31.626
romance can only be a very small part.

00:22:31.626 --> 00:22:32.267
I want to,

00:22:32.907 --> 00:22:33.586
but I just can't.

00:22:34.586 --> 00:22:35.546
I need to work hard.

00:22:35.826 --> 00:22:36.947
I owe it to my family,

00:22:36.947 --> 00:22:38.306
to myself,

00:22:38.306 --> 00:22:39.586
and even more to her, right?

00:22:40.306 --> 00:22:41.866
Besides, as a seasoned lawyer,

00:22:41.866 --> 00:22:43.907
my years of professional training
prevent me

00:22:44.507 --> 00:22:47.987
from acting rashly. I have to identify
potential risks early,

00:22:48.027 --> 00:22:49.106
warn clients,

00:22:49.106 --> 00:22:51.707
and prevent problems
before a contract starts.

00:22:51.707 --> 00:22:53.586
I even draft disclaimers for myself.

00:22:53.586 --> 00:22:54.747
So I know better than anyone,

00:22:55.626 --> 00:22:58.066
if something carries excessive risks,

00:22:58.707 --> 00:22:59.866
it's best not to start it.

00:23:13.386 --> 00:23:14.066
I disagree.

00:23:17.066 --> 00:23:18.586
You said it yourself.

00:23:18.826 --> 00:23:21.146
We're humans first, then lawyers.

00:23:21.427 --> 00:23:23.346
But what you just said is the contrary.

00:23:28.027 --> 00:23:29.386
But last night, someone else

00:23:29.386 --> 00:23:30.507
said the same thing to me.

00:23:32.427 --> 00:23:33.626
What I said earlier

00:23:34.227 --> 00:23:35.427
only applies to myself.

00:23:36.667 --> 00:23:38.546
Everyone has different circumstances.

00:23:40.346 --> 00:23:41.467
I do agree with Mr. Song.

00:23:43.626 --> 00:23:44.786
If we can fix regrets now,

00:23:46.947 --> 00:23:47.866
don't let it happen.

00:24:00.386 --> 00:24:01.306
What's going on?

00:24:02.346 --> 00:24:03.346
Why call me down so late?

00:24:06.667 --> 00:24:07.586
Why do we look like

00:24:07.586 --> 00:24:09.066
spies meeting in secret?

00:24:10.306 --> 00:24:10.947
Oh, please.

00:24:10.947 --> 00:24:12.106
James Bond

00:24:12.106 --> 00:24:13.386
drives Aston Martins.

00:24:13.747 --> 00:24:15.427
He's surrounded by luxury goods

00:24:15.427 --> 00:24:16.467
and beautiful women.

00:24:16.667 --> 00:24:18.146
We're just

00:24:18.346 --> 00:24:19.427
well-dressed

00:24:19.427 --> 00:24:20.306
CBD workers.

00:24:22.626 --> 00:24:24.027
Anyway, fancy cars and beauties

00:24:24.027 --> 00:24:25.066
don't really interest me.

00:24:25.826 --> 00:24:27.306
I've got you.

00:24:30.146 --> 00:24:31.346
Come. I'll take you somewhere.

00:24:40.427 --> 00:24:41.386
I Just saw your post.

00:24:42.467 --> 00:24:43.306
Did Yan Fei find you?

00:24:45.507 --> 00:24:46.427
I told her

00:24:46.427 --> 00:24:48.947
Mr. Zhou kept looking
at that photo repeatedly.

00:24:48.987 --> 00:24:49.987
He clearly cares a lot.

00:24:50.427 --> 00:24:52.106
I bet she was happy to hear that.

00:24:52.747 --> 00:24:53.866
She didn't say it outright,

00:24:54.227 --> 00:24:55.987
but she used sending
reports as an excuse

00:24:55.987 --> 00:24:57.586
to ask about Mr. Zhou indirectly.

00:24:58.507 --> 00:24:59.626
Then she left happily.

00:25:01.227 --> 00:25:02.306
But if she knew

00:25:02.306 --> 00:25:03.866
what Mr. Zhou just told you,

00:25:04.707 --> 00:25:05.866
she'd be upset for days.

00:25:06.667 --> 00:25:07.227
But

00:25:08.386 --> 00:25:09.546
Mr. Zhou has it tough too.

00:25:10.346 --> 00:25:11.187
It's really not easy.

00:25:12.747 --> 00:25:13.146
But

00:25:14.667 --> 00:25:15.386
I'm thinking

00:25:15.467 --> 00:25:16.267
choosing

00:25:18.267 --> 00:25:19.586
to let go after weighing the pros

00:25:19.586 --> 00:25:20.907
and cons mean the one just

00:25:22.066 --> 00:25:22.987
doesn't love enough.

00:25:26.507 --> 00:25:27.586
I get Mr. Zhou though.

00:25:28.866 --> 00:25:29.947
If a relationship

00:25:29.947 --> 00:25:32.306
traps both in difficulty,

00:25:33.066 --> 00:25:35.106
then letting go early is also love.

00:25:36.507 --> 00:25:38.626
No point clinging to something doomed.

00:25:40.386 --> 00:25:41.507
But until the very end,

00:25:41.507 --> 00:25:42.947
who really knows the outcome?

00:25:44.106 --> 00:25:44.987
I think this way,

00:25:44.987 --> 00:25:45.866
or either way around,

00:25:45.866 --> 00:25:46.947
but it's all just guessing.

00:25:47.507 --> 00:25:49.066
Just like we work on a case.

00:25:49.586 --> 00:25:50.346
You might think

00:25:50.667 --> 00:25:50.987
you'll

00:25:50.987 --> 00:25:52.546
lose for sure,

00:25:52.907 --> 00:25:54.907
but you still go all out.

00:25:56.826 --> 00:25:58.467
Shouldn't love get the same effort?

00:26:01.066 --> 00:26:02.826
Mr. Song didn't say it outright,

00:26:02.826 --> 00:26:04.667
but I sense he regrets it.

00:26:05.386 --> 00:26:07.267
We can't repeat
the older generation's mistakes,

00:26:07.747 --> 00:26:08.786
never communicating,

00:26:08.786 --> 00:26:09.987
bottling everything up,

00:26:10.306 --> 00:26:11.146
assuming others

00:26:11.146 --> 00:26:13.066
will magically

00:26:13.066 --> 00:26:14.306
understand them,

00:26:14.306 --> 00:26:15.227
and missing everything.

00:26:20.507 --> 00:26:21.947
I called you out tonight

00:26:22.586 --> 00:26:24.546
because I thought hard on the way back.

00:26:24.947 --> 00:26:25.507
I believe

00:26:26.747 --> 00:26:28.747
if I leave Jun An
and don't go back to Chongqing,

00:26:29.507 --> 00:26:30.786
I have other options.

00:26:31.427 --> 00:26:32.306
What do you mean?

00:26:36.106 --> 00:26:38.306
I'm considering dropping out
of the Talent Hunt Program.

00:26:40.187 --> 00:26:40.866
I think you might

00:26:40.866 --> 00:26:41.826
need this offer more.

00:26:44.707 --> 00:26:45.306
Jiang Chen,

00:26:45.947 --> 00:26:47.146
are you pitying me?

00:26:48.826 --> 00:26:49.707
You think I can't

00:26:49.707 --> 00:26:50.267
earn it myself

00:26:50.267 --> 00:26:51.146
unless you step aside?

00:26:51.786 --> 00:26:53.427
No! I just thought

00:26:53.947 --> 00:26:55.346
this might be better for us.

00:26:55.947 --> 00:26:56.826
Don't get mad.

00:26:57.146 --> 00:26:57.947
I'm not mad.

00:26:58.826 --> 00:27:00.346
Leave if you want.

00:27:00.826 --> 00:27:02.227
But if you're doing this for me,

00:27:02.626 --> 00:27:03.306
I won't take it.

00:27:03.907 --> 00:27:05.066
Don't misunderstand.

00:27:05.667 --> 00:27:07.346
I haven't decided anything yet.

00:27:07.346 --> 00:27:08.306
And I never said

00:27:08.907 --> 00:27:10.386
I'm only doing this for you.

00:27:10.987 --> 00:27:12.346
I'm just discussing it with you.

00:27:12.747 --> 00:27:14.747
Don't normal couples
discuss things together?

00:27:15.267 --> 00:27:17.386
First, we're not dating.

00:27:18.626 --> 00:27:20.467
At most, we kissed once.

00:27:20.546 --> 00:27:22.786
Whether you call it impulse
due to being drunk

00:27:22.947 --> 00:27:24.947
or being stressful and lonely,

00:27:25.306 --> 00:27:26.187
that's up to you.

00:27:26.747 --> 00:27:28.546
Besides, I don't need you
to give it to me.

00:27:29.227 --> 00:27:30.626
Even if you go all out,

00:27:31.146 --> 00:27:32.488
you still might not defeat me.

00:27:33.586 --> 00:27:34.586
What are you saying?

00:27:34.667 --> 00:27:36.066
What do you mean we are not dating?

00:27:37.346 --> 00:27:38.306
I'm not targeting you.

00:27:38.947 --> 00:27:40.346
I'm just not interested in love.

00:27:42.267 --> 00:27:44.667
Especially if it means
you are sacrificing for me.

00:27:45.747 --> 00:27:46.546
I can't bear that.

00:27:48.306 --> 00:27:50.146
Ren Jiatong, what are you so afraid of?

00:27:50.826 --> 00:27:53.346
What... What can't you face?

00:27:53.507 --> 00:27:54.546
Why are you so

00:27:55.227 --> 00:27:57.146
afraid to admit your own feelings?

00:27:57.146 --> 00:27:58.907
You act cold,

00:27:59.146 --> 00:28:00.546
giving off a standoffish vibe.

00:28:01.146 --> 00:28:02.187
Do you think that's cool?

00:28:02.187 --> 00:28:03.227
Or will it protect you?

00:28:03.227 --> 00:28:03.947
No.

00:28:04.747 --> 00:28:06.306
Right now, you're being cowardly.

00:28:06.306 --> 00:28:08.467
You're afraid of getting hurt.

00:28:08.467 --> 00:28:09.947
So you refuse to love.

00:28:10.786 --> 00:28:12.667
You're afraid of carrying
others' expectations.

00:28:12.707 --> 00:28:13.306
So you just

00:28:13.546 --> 00:28:15.306
never open your heart to anyone.

00:28:16.267 --> 00:28:16.947
Am I right?

00:28:17.866 --> 00:28:18.546
You're right.

00:28:19.987 --> 00:28:20.826
In my heart,

00:28:21.187 --> 00:28:22.626
all that love is pointless.

00:28:23.626 --> 00:28:25.626
I'd rather spend that time
drafting more reports,

00:28:25.626 --> 00:28:26.826
or reading more papers

00:28:27.386 --> 00:28:28.747
to secure my spot

00:28:28.747 --> 00:28:29.707
and get that offer.

00:28:32.306 --> 00:28:33.786
Let's get things straight now.

00:28:34.027 --> 00:28:34.907
No more trouble later.

00:28:36.427 --> 00:28:36.866
It's good.

00:28:40.187 --> 00:28:40.947
What do you mean?

00:28:44.066 --> 00:28:45.507
Did I make you feel troubled?

00:28:46.987 --> 00:28:48.146
Are you serious?

00:28:48.546 --> 00:28:50.786
You want us to have nothing
but rivalry from now on?

00:28:54.467 --> 00:28:55.187
I'm serious.

00:30:07.786 --> 00:30:08.146
Hello?

00:30:10.947 --> 00:30:11.386
Yan Fei?

00:30:18.907 --> 00:30:20.947
I'll be right there. Don't panic.

00:30:21.866 --> 00:30:22.792
Send me your location.

00:30:26.267 --> 00:30:27.346
What's with your brother?

00:30:27.907 --> 00:30:29.672
Not answering calls,
nowhere to be found.

00:30:30.427 --> 00:30:31.586
If he wants to break up,

00:30:32.066 --> 00:30:32.947
he should just say so.

00:30:33.106 --> 00:30:34.346
Is it so hard to be blunt?

00:30:34.866 --> 00:30:37.507
I don't believe he can hide forever.

00:30:37.907 --> 00:30:39.826
So you were actually trying
to ambush my brother?

00:30:39.947 --> 00:30:41.586
But since my car was restricted today

00:30:41.586 --> 00:30:42.707
and I drove his car instead,

00:30:42.786 --> 00:30:44.386
you accidentally ended up cornering me?

00:30:45.866 --> 00:30:46.947
We're both women.

00:30:47.427 --> 00:30:49.747
I'm sure you understand this situation.

00:30:50.306 --> 00:30:52.008
We've been together for over six months.

00:30:53.747 --> 00:30:54.106
Look.

00:30:55.826 --> 00:30:57.907
This is the photo your brother and I
took abroad.

00:30:58.306 --> 00:31:00.586
Everything was fine
when he dropped me at the airport.

00:31:01.747 --> 00:31:02.667
It's been days now.

00:31:03.227 --> 00:31:04.106
No reply

00:31:04.306 --> 00:31:05.066
to texts or calls.

00:31:05.427 --> 00:31:06.106
What's the deal?

00:31:06.546 --> 00:31:08.346
But I can't reach him either right now.

00:31:08.907 --> 00:31:10.626
I just called his assistant.

00:31:11.227 --> 00:31:12.947
She said something important came up.

00:31:12.987 --> 00:31:13.507
I also think

00:31:13.507 --> 00:31:15.507
he's definitely tied up
with something critical.

00:31:15.707 --> 00:31:17.187
Maybe just wait a bit longer?

00:31:17.586 --> 00:31:18.267
Just excuses.

00:31:18.546 --> 00:31:20.707
What could be so urgent
he can't even text back?

00:31:22.106 --> 00:31:24.667
I don't care. He owes me an explanation.

00:31:25.027 --> 00:31:26.227
I'll break up with him,

00:31:26.386 --> 00:31:28.586
but not by being dumped unknowingly.

00:31:30.467 --> 00:31:32.866
Do you have specific demands?

00:31:33.907 --> 00:31:34.632
Two million.

00:31:38.586 --> 00:31:39.346
A hundred thousand.

00:31:39.626 --> 00:31:40.346
Not a cent more.

00:31:40.826 --> 00:31:42.586
But give him three more days.

00:31:42.907 --> 00:31:43.626
When he's back,

00:31:43.626 --> 00:31:45.066
you two sort everything out.

00:31:45.747 --> 00:31:47.346
Yan Da isn't the person you think he is.

00:31:47.546 --> 00:31:49.106
He's my brother. I know him.

00:31:49.427 --> 00:31:50.306
He must be swamped

00:31:50.306 --> 00:31:51.866
by something important.

00:31:52.227 --> 00:31:53.747
As for his work,

00:31:53.747 --> 00:31:54.907
I honestly don't know much.

00:31:55.187 --> 00:31:56.306
I called his assistant.

00:31:56.306 --> 00:31:57.306
She was evasive too.

00:31:58.267 --> 00:32:00.427
This hundred thousand is your own money?

00:32:00.826 --> 00:32:01.747
I have credit cards,

00:32:02.467 --> 00:32:03.626
but little cash on hand.

00:32:03.626 --> 00:32:04.826
That's the best I can do.

00:32:05.546 --> 00:32:07.027
But after you take the money,

00:32:07.106 --> 00:32:08.267
sign an agreement with me.

00:32:08.667 --> 00:32:10.386
You must promise not to tell anyone

00:32:10.467 --> 00:32:11.786
about your relationship.

00:32:12.146 --> 00:32:13.546
Also, those pictures

00:32:13.667 --> 00:32:14.346
and chat records.

00:32:14.987 --> 00:32:16.826
Everything waits until he comes back.

00:32:17.267 --> 00:32:20.507
I won't sign. And I won't
take your money.

00:32:21.106 --> 00:32:21.866
But don't worry.

00:32:22.427 --> 00:32:24.626
Hearing what you just said,
I agree to three days.

00:32:24.626 --> 00:32:25.507
After three days,

00:32:25.707 --> 00:32:27.786
if your brother
still vanishes like this,

00:32:28.066 --> 00:32:28.586
not even you,

00:32:28.907 --> 00:32:29.786
nor ten blood sisters

00:32:30.306 --> 00:32:31.027
could save him.

00:32:34.227 --> 00:32:35.027
I understand.

00:32:35.747 --> 00:32:37.227
But let me say something.

00:32:38.346 --> 00:32:40.626
Money can't fix everything.

00:32:41.187 --> 00:32:43.507
Sometimes, it just creates
more problems.

00:32:48.507 --> 00:32:48.866
But

00:32:49.267 --> 00:32:50.146
you're decent.

00:32:50.707 --> 00:32:53.386
In my opinion, Yan Da
should call you brother.

00:33:07.066 --> 00:33:07.586
What now?

00:33:09.306 --> 00:33:09.987
Another round?

00:33:10.586 --> 00:33:11.066
Come on.

00:33:11.427 --> 00:33:12.586
Two of the same, please.

00:33:16.507 --> 00:33:16.907
Thanks.

00:33:19.546 --> 00:33:20.947
What? Your brother isn't back yet,

00:33:20.947 --> 00:33:22.027
and you're handling this?

00:33:23.786 --> 00:33:25.346
I've been dumped like that before.

00:33:26.027 --> 00:33:27.907
That's why I get her heartbreak.

00:33:28.267 --> 00:33:30.947
Helping her feel better is worth it.

00:33:31.467 --> 00:33:32.427
Besides, I think

00:33:33.027 --> 00:33:35.027
that girl genuinely cares
about my brother.

00:33:35.546 --> 00:33:36.507
Her demanding money

00:33:36.507 --> 00:33:37.747
was just to force him out.

00:33:38.146 --> 00:33:39.707
She showed me their photos together

00:33:40.146 --> 00:33:40.987
and chat records

00:33:41.386 --> 00:33:42.467
My brother even kept

00:33:42.467 --> 00:33:43.786
liking her posts

00:33:43.786 --> 00:33:45.027
from his secret account.

00:33:45.106 --> 00:33:46.826
Can't blame her for getting obsessed.

00:33:47.187 --> 00:33:48.907
If that's the case, your brother's

00:33:50.227 --> 00:33:51.227
totally at fault here.

00:33:51.586 --> 00:33:52.346
Exactly.

00:33:52.707 --> 00:33:53.747
He's unreasonable.

00:33:54.507 --> 00:33:56.546
He won't even break up properly.

00:33:56.546 --> 00:33:57.386
Let me tell you.

00:33:57.507 --> 00:33:59.187
The scariest thing in dating
is a breakup

00:33:59.187 --> 00:34:00.267
with no explanation.

00:34:00.546 --> 00:34:01.866
A vanished person

00:34:02.027 --> 00:34:04.346
doesn't just ruin your relationship.

00:34:04.826 --> 00:34:06.707
He crushes your faith in love

00:34:06.786 --> 00:34:07.786
and your self-confidence.

00:34:08.387 --> 00:34:09.427
You'll doubt

00:34:09.427 --> 00:34:11.066
if you do anything wrong

00:34:11.387 --> 00:34:12.987
and fail anything,

00:34:13.347 --> 00:34:14.787
or you are

00:34:14.827 --> 00:34:15.987
too ugly or fat

00:34:16.307 --> 00:34:18.546
to get a proper goodbye?

00:34:22.387 --> 00:34:22.987
Just rambling.

00:34:24.666 --> 00:34:25.387
Actually,

00:34:26.387 --> 00:34:27.947
even clean breakups

00:34:29.467 --> 00:34:30.586
may still hurt.

00:34:31.387 --> 00:34:32.427
You'll get hurt

00:34:32.987 --> 00:34:35.507
if he leaves too ruthlessly.

00:34:35.947 --> 00:34:37.827
Get hurt if he moves on too fast.

00:34:38.027 --> 00:34:39.947
If he finds someone new quickly,

00:34:40.146 --> 00:34:42.507
you hurt more. Being hurt
is unavoidable.

00:34:45.987 --> 00:34:47.987
Teachers graded us back in school.

00:34:48.947 --> 00:34:49.427
Later,

00:34:50.186 --> 00:34:51.987
as interns, mentors graded us.

00:34:52.347 --> 00:34:53.947
If we become lawyers in the future,

00:34:54.827 --> 00:34:55.947
clients become our graders.

00:34:56.467 --> 00:34:57.347
Love has no grades,

00:34:57.907 --> 00:34:58.787
no standard answer,

00:34:59.307 --> 00:35:00.027
and no standards.

00:35:00.546 --> 00:35:01.787
We've memorized endless laws,

00:35:01.907 --> 00:35:02.787
but show me one

00:35:03.507 --> 00:35:04.467
that dictates

00:35:05.027 --> 00:35:06.507
exactly when

00:35:06.666 --> 00:35:07.787
the right words

00:35:07.907 --> 00:35:09.586
or the perfect action exist?

00:35:11.427 --> 00:35:12.226
Impossible.

00:35:13.546 --> 00:35:15.907
Statutes only show risks

00:35:15.947 --> 00:35:18.467
we might encounter.

00:35:19.546 --> 00:35:20.666
I'll bet with you.

00:35:20.746 --> 00:35:22.507
Look at our firm's partners,

00:35:22.507 --> 00:35:23.507
every one of them,

00:35:23.626 --> 00:35:24.787
with mid-levels included.

00:35:25.427 --> 00:35:27.546
They may have been artistic when young,

00:35:27.666 --> 00:35:29.106
but asking them to pursue a love

00:35:29.186 --> 00:35:30.746
without counting the cost now

00:35:31.546 --> 00:35:33.106
is nearly impossible.

00:35:33.867 --> 00:35:35.186
As long as we work hard enough,

00:35:35.266 --> 00:35:36.307
even Earth could wander.

00:35:36.307 --> 00:35:37.947
The Trisolarans were even defeated.

00:35:38.146 --> 00:35:40.787
But the professional instinct
engraved in their bones

00:35:41.027 --> 00:35:41.827
is undefeatable.

00:35:41.827 --> 00:35:42.787
Miss Yan, look at you.

00:35:43.307 --> 00:35:45.507
How many male lawyers broke your hearts

00:35:45.706 --> 00:35:48.106
to make you become this bitter?

00:35:49.706 --> 00:35:50.626
You're teasing me?

00:35:51.186 --> 00:35:52.507
How about you and Ren Jiatong?

00:35:54.987 --> 00:35:55.546
Not great.

00:35:57.347 --> 00:35:59.746
Flirting all day at the firm.

00:35:59.787 --> 00:36:01.226
Guo Xiaoyu might not notice,

00:36:01.307 --> 00:36:03.266
but I see everything clearly!

00:36:03.787 --> 00:36:04.706
You think you're smart.

00:36:05.266 --> 00:36:07.226
I guess Holmes is a also a bad guy,

00:36:07.507 --> 00:36:09.066
moving on to a new girlfriend so fast.

00:36:10.226 --> 00:36:11.266
Suit yourself then.

00:38:18.186 --> 00:38:20.027
(Ren Jiatong, what are you
so afraid of?)

00:38:20.787 --> 00:38:22.907
What can't you face?

00:38:23.027 --> 00:38:24.106
Why are you so afraid

00:38:24.787 --> 00:38:26.706
to admit your own feelings?

00:38:26.706 --> 00:38:27.467
(You act cold.)

00:38:27.467 --> 00:38:28.907
(Right now, you're being cowardly.)

00:38:28.907 --> 00:38:31.066
You're afraid of getting hurt.

00:38:31.066 --> 00:38:32.546
So you refuse to love.

00:38:33.387 --> 00:38:35.266
You're afraid of carrying
others' expectations.

00:38:35.307 --> 00:38:35.907
so you just

00:38:36.146 --> 00:38:37.907
never open your heart to anyone.

00:38:40.746 --> 00:38:42.146
(Let's get things straight now.)

00:38:42.387 --> 00:38:43.432
(No more trouble later.)

00:38:44.827 --> 00:38:45.266
It's fine.

00:38:46.146 --> 00:38:46.907
What do you mean?

00:38:50.027 --> 00:38:51.467
Did I make you feel troubled?

00:39:06.346 --> 00:39:08.712
(Body warmer)

00:39:11.848 --> 00:39:13.864
(Body warmer, brown sugar)

00:39:14.351 --> 00:39:17.001
(Body warmer and brown sugar
on the table. Note first hotpot date.)

00:39:17.001 --> 00:39:17.832
(You may need it recently.)

00:39:33.746 --> 00:39:35.027
Post it if you want.

00:39:35.467 --> 00:39:36.947
Be proactive when pursuing a girl.

00:39:39.427 --> 00:39:40.467
Are you lecturing me now?

00:39:46.867 --> 00:39:47.706
What if right now,

00:39:48.586 --> 00:39:51.546
that lawyer you set to "only he can see"

00:39:51.947 --> 00:39:53.146
came back

00:39:53.626 --> 00:39:55.546
and chased you hard, would you

00:39:55.987 --> 00:39:56.626
say yes?

00:39:58.706 --> 00:40:00.347
How crazy would I have

00:40:00.427 --> 00:40:02.467
to be chased by a male lawyer?

00:40:04.347 --> 00:40:05.106
What do you mean?

00:40:06.387 --> 00:40:06.907
Also,

00:40:09.427 --> 00:40:11.146
he won't make any moves.

00:40:12.827 --> 00:40:13.546
For a lawyer,

00:40:14.146 --> 00:40:16.146
disclaimers are everything.

00:40:16.387 --> 00:40:17.907
He has safety boundary

00:40:18.666 --> 00:40:20.307
and future plan.

00:40:20.987 --> 00:40:22.586
A senior told me

00:40:22.867 --> 00:40:24.507
if you date with a lawyer,

00:40:24.787 --> 00:40:26.507
you must be in his plan.

00:40:27.066 --> 00:40:28.186
Then you'll be in his heart.

00:40:30.507 --> 00:40:31.867
I was once in his heart,

00:40:33.066 --> 00:40:34.467
but his plan

00:40:35.106 --> 00:40:36.186
doesn't include me.

00:40:39.387 --> 00:40:40.146
Don't comfort me.

00:40:41.387 --> 00:40:43.347
It is enough to realize
I'm in his heart.

00:40:44.307 --> 00:40:45.467
He liked me once.

00:40:46.146 --> 00:40:47.746
I genuinely felt it.

00:40:48.507 --> 00:40:49.307
No misunderstanding

00:40:49.987 --> 00:40:50.907
or illusion.

00:40:52.907 --> 00:40:54.186
He's too scared to move forward.

00:40:55.907 --> 00:40:57.266
And I know exactly why.

00:41:01.827 --> 00:41:02.226
To you.

00:41:04.186 --> 00:41:04.907
You're a hero.

00:41:05.467 --> 00:41:06.266
Don't toast to me.

00:41:06.987 --> 00:41:09.307
To Jun An Law Firm,
and the Talent Hunt Program.

00:41:10.066 --> 00:41:13.546
To forever rational and clear-headed

00:41:14.186 --> 00:41:14.947
lawyers.

00:41:15.706 --> 00:41:17.266
I won't toast for last one. You drink.

00:41:46.066 --> 00:41:47.266
What's going on with you two?

00:41:48.347 --> 00:41:49.427
My brother's romantic mess.

00:41:49.626 --> 00:41:50.666
I may not handle it,

00:41:50.666 --> 00:41:51.907
so I asked Jiang Chen for help.

00:41:52.546 --> 00:41:54.507
Who knew she'd betray my trust
and keep a trick

00:41:54.507 --> 00:41:55.307
up her sleeve.

00:41:55.467 --> 00:41:56.347
I shouldn't help her.

00:41:56.947 --> 00:41:58.307
Make her delete it

00:41:58.307 --> 00:41:59.626
while the reposts are low!

00:42:00.146 --> 00:42:01.146
She literally posted

00:42:01.507 --> 00:42:03.626
Xingke's second princess
got someone to threaten her.

00:42:04.106 --> 00:42:06.106
This'll blow up into another scandal!

00:42:07.586 --> 00:42:08.586
Playing this trick

00:42:08.827 --> 00:42:10.186
means talking won't work.

00:42:10.947 --> 00:42:12.266
She forces my brother to show up.

00:42:12.387 --> 00:42:13.387
I can't let him show up.

00:42:13.666 --> 00:42:14.186
Pointless.

00:42:14.186 --> 00:42:14.867
Where is he?

00:42:15.626 --> 00:42:16.626
Overseas.

00:42:17.266 --> 00:42:18.507
Haven't reached him these days.

00:42:19.106 --> 00:42:20.027
But my family said

00:42:20.027 --> 00:42:21.146
he's returning soon.

00:42:21.947 --> 00:42:22.827
You'd better hurry!

00:42:22.827 --> 00:42:24.027
Or the mess with Jiang Chen...

00:42:25.907 --> 00:42:26.467
You two will

00:42:27.186 --> 00:42:28.106
definitely get spun

00:42:28.106 --> 00:42:29.546
into eight hundred gossip versions.

00:42:30.186 --> 00:42:30.867
Stop thinking.

00:42:31.307 --> 00:42:32.467
We were misunderstood.

00:42:40.106 --> 00:42:42.027
Everyone, meeting in the room
in ten minutes.

00:42:42.746 --> 00:42:43.146
Mr. Zhou,

00:42:43.467 --> 00:42:45.066
Guo Xiaoyu and I compiled a report

00:42:45.066 --> 00:42:46.626
about the tennis bag in footage.

00:42:46.626 --> 00:42:48.226
We found issues and emailed you.

00:42:48.666 --> 00:42:49.507
Okay, I'll review it.

00:43:15.368 --> 00:43:19.578
(A lawyer's mindset: Disclaimers
Answer: It's self-protection.)

00:43:19.578 --> 00:43:24.318
(Especially in practice, lawyers should
keep evidence when giving legal advice.)

00:43:24.318 --> 00:43:27.880
(Standardize communication and define
boundaries to avoid legal risks.)
