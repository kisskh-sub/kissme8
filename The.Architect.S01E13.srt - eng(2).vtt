(Governor, what reward will you get today?)

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.400
Help!

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.920
There's a rare beast in the cage.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.879
It must be offered to His Majesty
after the hunt ends.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.400
Take good care of it.

00:01:56.879 --> 00:01:58.519
You must never open the red cloth

00:01:58.799 --> 00:01:59.879
and shock the beast.

00:01:59.879 --> 00:02:00.599
- Yes!
- Yes!

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:13.919
This is a forest for hunting.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.460
There might be random arrows
flying around.

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:16.240
Follow me.

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.879
A few arrows won't hurt me.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.400
I don't need you to care about me.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.240
You give me a fragrance pouch,

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.090
but you don't let me take care of you?

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:31.120
It's just a fragrance pouch.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.330
Your Lordship need not
be concerned with its importance.

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:44.759
Xi Yan,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.719
are you all right?

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.280
I'm getting revenge myself.

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:32.759
Don't go after a running enemy.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.080
Let's treat your injury first.

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:42.800
Why did you save me today?

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.280
I didn't mean to save you.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.280
Just now,

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.080
I only did it to avoid the arrow.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:52.520
Sure.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.719
Say you regret saving me now
and I'll believe in you.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.479
Now that it has come to this,
why should I say I regret it?

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:04.319
If you won't say that,

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.840
I'll assume that you care for me.

Prince Duan

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.399
hunted a honey badger.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.360
What is this? It's such a big beast.

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.199
What is this?

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.120
Your Majesty.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.240
Apparently,

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:07.040
this is a rare beast hunted today.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.639
It is sent to be appreciated
by Your Majesty especially.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.079
Good.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:11.879
Open the cloth.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:13.920
I want to appreciate it

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:14.920
with everyone else.

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:16.319
Yes.

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:24.160
Isn't that Princess Wan'er?

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.319
I've only seen humans and beasts
sleeping together in storybooks.

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:28.959
I didn't expect this
to happen in real life.

00:05:28.959 --> 00:05:30.720
She actually has such a fetish?

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.120
I pity Governor Pei.

00:05:40.079 --> 00:05:41.000
Ridiculous!

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:01.279
Father,

00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:03.199
she knocked me out

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.680
and trapped me in a cage!

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.759
I, Xi Yan,

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:11.920
greet Your Majesty.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.420
Do you know that harming a princess

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:15.380
carries the same crime
as lying to the emperor?

00:06:15.399 --> 00:06:16.990
You should be beheaded
according to the law.

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:23.439
Your Majesty, punishing someone
with just Her Highness' testimony

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.199
will ruin the authority of Liang's law.

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:28.990
Your Majesty, please investigate this.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.360
This has nothing to do with me.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:31.879
I am just a woman.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.560
How could I knock out
a beast and Her Highness

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.560
and trap them in a cage together?

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:37.560
You...

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.399
You had a helper.

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:43.600
I am just a concubine
in the Governor's Residence.

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:46.000
How could I afford a helper

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.759
to carry out this grave crime with me?

00:06:49.399 --> 00:06:50.000
Mr. Pei,

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:51.800
did the Qilin Guards

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:53.879
find anything?

00:06:56.125 --> 00:06:58.160
Governor, I found this in the cage

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.279
where the princess
and the beast were trapped.

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:02.350
This is the Fragrance
of the Sacred Realm.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.160
Lighting it can make people
become enamored.

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:05.600
I've cleaned

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:06.519
every trace.

00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:08.820
However, the princess
has a noble status.

00:07:08.839 --> 00:07:10.390
Doing this equals lying to the emperor.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.959
I only want to protect Xi Yan.

00:07:16.759 --> 00:07:19.519
Your Majesty, the Qilin Guards
have investigated thoroughly.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.310
They haven't found anything yet.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.160
According to what you said,

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:25.879
this is

00:07:26.079 --> 00:07:27.319
an unresolved case.

00:07:28.079 --> 00:07:28.839
Is the princess

00:07:28.839 --> 00:07:30.439
going to be tricked for no reason?

00:07:34.199 --> 00:07:35.720
I dare not lie to Your Majesty.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.240
The culprit of this case

00:07:38.959 --> 00:07:40.079
is here.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:42.399
Speak!

00:07:42.759 --> 00:07:44.680
The person who trapped
Her Highness in the cage

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.279
was Governor Pei.

00:07:48.639 --> 00:07:49.560
That's impossible.

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:50.160
Governor Pei?

00:07:51.399 --> 00:07:51.959
You...

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:53.319
Lowly servant!

00:07:53.439 --> 00:07:54.240
That's nonsense!

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:56.610
Falsely accusing a superior official
of the imperial court

00:07:57.199 --> 00:07:59.120
is also a crime
that carries capital punishment.

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.240
I dare not lie.

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:03.000
I saw the Qilin Guards

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.360
carry this cage myself.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:05.439
Moreover,

00:08:05.839 --> 00:08:07.000
the Governor and Her Highness

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.700
had fragrance pouches
that came in pairs.

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.319
It was given to Her Highness
by the Governor.

00:08:12.279 --> 00:08:13.079
I think

00:08:13.319 --> 00:08:14.319
the fragrance pouch

00:08:14.759 --> 00:08:15.639
contains a secret.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.560
This fragrance pouch
helps repel insects and dissolve poison.

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.390
I'm sure it can help My Lordship
show your skills at the hunting ground.

00:08:26.839 --> 00:08:28.000
The hunt is over.

00:08:29.079 --> 00:08:31.279
It's time for His Majesty
to reward others.

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:33.960
Governor,

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.639
what reward will you get today?

00:08:43.639 --> 00:08:46.559
Your Majesty, the imperial physician
has checked the fragrance pouches.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:49.080
Her Highness's fragrance pouch
has a secret fragrance inside it

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.480
that provokes wild beasts
into aggressive attacks.

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:55.879
This fragrance pouch...

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:57.600
You gave me

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.039
this fragrance pouch!

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.650
Your Majesty, please investigate it.

00:09:01.159 --> 00:09:02.940
Her Highness
has always seen me as an enemy.

00:09:03.159 --> 00:09:05.279
She tried to take my life multiple times.

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.180
Why would she put on
a fragrance pouch I made?

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.159
Your Majesty, please seek justice for me.

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:13.960
Yu,

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.440
this wretch is even harming you now.

00:09:16.639 --> 00:09:18.159
You can't spare her easily.

00:09:19.639 --> 00:09:20.320
Mr. Pei,

00:09:22.159 --> 00:09:23.759
what else do you have to say?

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.879
I have nothing else to say.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.919
(The Governor's Residence)
Scheming to ruin the Princess's reputation.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:45.000
You can no longer lead the Qilin Guards.

00:09:45.112 --> 00:09:47.631
Return the Qilin Token
to the imperial court.

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.560
You have been suspended
to reflect on your mistakes.

00:09:49.583 --> 00:09:51.470
The consequences
will be evaluated at a later time.

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:52.879
That's all.

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.000
(Sorry, Pei Yu.)

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:57.320
(No one can stop me
from finding the truth.)

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:59.759
(If all the evidence is pointing
at Prince Duan's Residence,)

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:01.820
(I have no choice
but to participate in the scheme.)

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:11.187
(The Governor's Residence)

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:13.837
(Keep one's abilities in reserve)

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:20.679
Governor, everyone is afraid of you
because you hold military authority.

00:10:21.039 --> 00:10:21.600
Now,

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.200
this is an opportunity for them.

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:24.399
Enough.

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.600
Lady Xi Yan is too much.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.960
She knew you'd never do anything to her.

00:10:30.879 --> 00:10:32.919
Thankfully, the Qilin Guards
only obey your command.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.260
Even if you lose the Qilin Token,
it doesn't affect much.

00:10:50.675 --> 00:10:53.112
(Renowned for Virtue and Brilliance)

00:10:53.187 --> 00:11:00.262
(Prince Duan's Residence)

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:01.120
We are here.

00:11:01.399 --> 00:11:02.039
You may get off.

00:11:17.159 --> 00:11:18.879
When I was in the Governor's Residence,

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:20.960
I did something bad to you, Xiao.

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:22.080
You must first give

00:11:22.399 --> 00:11:23.240
before you take.

00:11:24.039 --> 00:11:25.279
If you don't do something,

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:26.759
you can't earn his trust.

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:30.039
Right now, he has been reprimanded
by His Majesty

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:32.090
and has no choice
but to surrender the Qilin Token.

00:11:32.279 --> 00:11:33.120
That alone

00:11:33.679 --> 00:11:35.720
shows that you are still loyal to me.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.159
Xiao, you are indeed the one
who understands me most.

00:11:40.879 --> 00:11:41.840
From now on,

00:11:42.039 --> 00:11:43.440
I will do everything

00:11:43.639 --> 00:11:44.399
for you.
