[The Vendetta of An]

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:38.380
[Xue Pavilion]

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:43.130
It's ready.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.410
It's made with the material we procured, right?

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.570
It's made with the gold we procured.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.210
I kept him under surveillance for the entire process.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.340
Second Master, it's four cun, as per your instructions.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.460
It'll be easy for a child to handle.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.620
However,

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.220
Young Master is still very young.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.180
Should we give him something this sharp?

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:57.310
Why not?

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.410
I was already slaughtering sheep when I was his age.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.770
The young master of Huben Army

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:02.960
will lead the army in the future.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.070
He has to prove himself capable.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.570
Don't tell my brother about this.

[Episode 6]

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.960
Huai'an!

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:58.460
Huai'an!

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.460
Huai'an!

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:01.020
Huai'an!

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:11.620
Regarding this matter,

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.650
I can only

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.370
depend on you.

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:18.580
All right.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:20.620
I'll do it on your behalf.

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:22.300
You must hang in there.

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.900
Please hang in there.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.530
Huai'an.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.450
Please hang in there!

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:44.420
Huai'an?

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:45.930
- Huai'an. - Xie Huai'an.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.460
Huai'an!

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.210
Hang in there.

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.970
Where's the physician?

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:49.420
Why isn't he here yet?

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:50.370
Xiaoqing has already gone to notify him.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.250
The physician will arrive soon.

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.060
Why did she go to notify him?

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.530
Just bring him here!

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:55.210
Huai'an?

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.570
Huai'an.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.740
Hurry!

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:00.740
Prepare the anti-bleeding decoction.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.020
I'll pull out the sword.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.580
You, help me stop the bleeding.

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:15.210
Okay.

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:19.250
Can you do this?

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:22.370
I cannot.

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:23.490
Go away.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.060
Don't stare at me.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.940
If he can't do it, I can't do it.

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:28.740
Useless fools.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.620
I'll do it.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:30.810
He'll bleed a lot.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.930
I'm not afraid.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:53.810
Hang in there.

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:11.320
I rushed here upon hearing

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.120
that Mr. Xie was attacked.

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:13.690
What's the current situation?

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:16.860
How is Mr. Xie doing?

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.660
Guys,

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:23.660
why are you guys keeping quiet?

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:26.060
Please tell me something.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:32.010
This...

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:35.220
You want me to head back?

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:36.330
I...

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.370
How am I supposed to report back?

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:43.580
It's all my fault.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.330
This wouldn't have happened

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:48.280
had I not failed

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.100
to deliver the letter back then.

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:51.820
I was at the entrance just now.

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.950
I didn't dare to enter.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:56.010
I was afraid that he might...

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:58.980
In his letter, he stated

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.130
that he would spend the rest of his life

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:04.930
to avenge his family.

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:09.780
He was ready

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:10.740
for a life like this.

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:14.370
He won't blame anyone

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:18.620
even if he dies in the process.

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:27.620
Don't be afraid.

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:36.620
Huai'an won't fall yet.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.130
Young Master!

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:02.490
Young Master is here.

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:04.860
Young Master.

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:07.490
Uncle!

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:08.780
Uncle!

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.780
Father is still alive!

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.300
Hurry and find a physician!

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:28.860
Father.

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:30.300
Please don't die.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:31.330
Father!

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:33.570
Don't leave me!

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.490
Don't leave me!

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:36.890
Don't leave me!

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:43.890
Father?

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:50.450
Where are we?

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.060
It was Uncle!

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:54.980
Uncle rescued us!

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.490
Protect your sister.

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:06.250
You two

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:12.920
must live on.

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:22.100
Father!

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:31.880
Father!

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.730
Protect your sister.

00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:44.160
You two must live on.

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:49.580
Father.

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:02.900
Master.

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:08.050
I know what you guys are trying to ask.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.140
You see,

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.050
I don't know.

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.660
What do you mean?

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:19.930
He won't die if he manages

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:21.570
to regain consciousness.

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:23.810
That sounds ominous.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:26.540
What if he doesn't?

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:28.020
Great question.

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:30.970
His injuries are too grievous.

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:33.090
He has lost too much blood.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:34.970
He might not wake up again.

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:37.540
I've already fed him the medicine I prescribed.

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:39.540
At least his heart can keep beating.

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:42.050
If he doesn't regain consciousness,

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:44.540
he'll age very slowly.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.610
By the time we die,

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:47.780
get to old age,

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:49.140
or is reduced to ashes,

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:51.970
his hair might only turn gray by then.

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:56.980
Does that mean he'll be in an eternal coma?

00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.350
You can say so.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.100
He will regain consciousness.

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:04.550
He begged me for a favor

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:05.710
before he fainted.

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:06.900
I know.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.710
There are many things he has yet to accomplish.

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:11.860
For a person like him,

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:13.780
if he has any unfulfilled wishes,

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:17.710
he'll definitely wake up and fulfill them.

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:19.200
Xiaoqing,

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.210
the messenger under you

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:23.390
is being targeted.

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:25.350
You have been targeted as well.

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:29.930
Let's investigate the case together.

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:41.160
I've been wearing this protective charm

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:44.130
for as long as I can remember.

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:46.280
Although I've gone through various trials,

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:49.560
it did keep me safe until now.

00:10:58.190 --> 00:10:59.200
I'll hand it to you.

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:03.250
May you overcome this ordeal.

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:01.130
What does this mean?

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:04.490
The general sent us a letter.

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:08.090
He said you made a mistake.

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:12.600
I want to know

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:16.730
what Yan Fengshan thought my mistake was.

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:21.890
When the city fell,

00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:23.560
your subordinates,

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:27.640
they failed to capture the deposed emperor.

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:30.280
That was one of your mistakes.

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:34.040
Now that your nephew has the deposed emperor with him,

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:37.730
there's no way he can be killed off.

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:44.130
You disobeyed the general's order.

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:47.090
Not only did you intervene personally,

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:50.730
but you also mobilized many of our men without permission.

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:54.330
You completely lost sight of the bigger picture.

00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:57.130
And, Qingyi died because of you.

00:12:58.310 --> 00:12:59.970
That was your second mistake.

00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:04.520
There's no place for you in the Hidden Soldier Alley anymore.

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:51.040
After him!

00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:54.990
Give it to me.

00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:56.610
- Just let him play with it. - Give it to me!

00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:57.730
Give it to him.

00:14:58.190 --> 00:14:59.440
Give it to me!

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:03.520
Let him have it.

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:15.290
Sir, you're seriously wounded.

00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:17.120
I didn't dare to hire a physician.

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:18.360
I only used

00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:19.480
the Liu family's anti-bleeding mix on you.

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:30.090
I was fortunate.

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:31.880
I'm still alive.

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:34.450
Xingzi,

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:36.210
since when did you get yourself a family?

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:41.170
I'm a single man in my thirties.

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:43.240
I wasn't very careful with my money

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:45.290
when I had some.

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:47.290
Speaking of which,

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:49.200
Sir,

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:51.570
you rarely visited me all these years.

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:53.530
It never occurred to me that I would see you in a wounded state.

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:55.050
So,

00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:57.640
is there anything important I can do for you?

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:03.880
Where's your carriage?

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:04.810
I have one.

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:07.400
I kept it at the marketplace's carriage house.

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:09.400
Can I leave the city with it?

00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:09.960
You can.

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:11.050
It's fully licensed.

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:12.200
Take me out of the city.

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:15.680
Sir,

00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:18.160
I saw that you had a travel pass with you

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:20.030
when I was dressing your wound.

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:23.010
Must I follow you?

00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:31.810
Right now,

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:35.770
you're the only person I can trust.

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:41.770
Back then, you joined hands with me to kill my brother.

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:49.600
Back then, I...

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:52.290
I merely struck him down

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:54.680
as proof of my loyalty,

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:56.370
Sir.

00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:58.850
I did it so that I could survive.

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:01.360
What poor people like us want

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:04.050
is to survive.

00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:07.490
If you wish to survive,

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:09.770
you have to follow my command.

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:11.750
It's not like I'll harm you.

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:13.440
Am I right?

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:17.160
I'll go and get the carriage.

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:18.810
It'll take two to three days.

00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:19.790
You have two days.

00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:20.880
In two days,

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:22.330
at sunset,

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:25.880
at the alley to the west of Yanping Gate,

00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:29.160
I'll wait for you there.

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:34.680
Okay.

00:18:58.380 --> 00:18:59.050
Xingzi.

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:02.330
Once you've done me this favor,

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:05.250
we shall be even.

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:08.010
We won't see each other again

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:11.490
after I leave the city.

00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:14.920
Thank you, Sir.

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:38.850
You're chopping firewood at night.

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:40.120
Don't you think it's noisy?

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:44.750
What's wrong?

00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:47.770
I was just trying to help her out.

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:49.600
Besides,

00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:51.530
it's not like we're at a stranger's residence.

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:52.090
This is

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:53.440
Miss Bai Wan's residence.

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:55.490
I'm chopping firewood for her.

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:57.250
What has that got to do with Miss Bai Wan?

00:19:57.580 --> 00:19:59.160
You were being noisy by chopping firewood

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:00.880
at night.

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:03.600
What I meant was,

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:07.120
Miss Bai Wan was much calmer than we were

00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:09.360
when the physician was pulling the sword out of Xie Huai'an.

00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:10.850
Now, he needs people to tend to him.

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:12.920
And, Miss Bai Wan is more meticulous than we are.

00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:14.090
Therefore, I was thinking

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:15.600
that I could do something like chopping firewood to help them out.

00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:17.560
Unlike you.

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:18.290
You only stand here like a statue.

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:43.810
Say,

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:46.240
what's the relationship

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:47.250
between Bai Wan and Xie Huai'an?

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:48.490
That has nothing to do with you.

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:51.120
You should rest early.

00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:52.360
You have to take over my shift tomorrow.

00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:55.730
Of course it has nothing to do with me.

00:20:58.030 --> 00:20:59.440
I know I've fallen from grace.

00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:00.540
But back then,

00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:01.960
I was a member of the imperial family.

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:03.440
Within the Capital,

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:05.290
among the high-ranking noble families,

00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:06.360
I know every matter

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:07.440
related to them, big or small.

00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:09.490
I even witnessed some of them.

00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:11.010
For example,

00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:13.920
Xie Huai'an has a younger sister.

00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:21.050
When his sister turned one year old,

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:22.730
she received a birthday gift

00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:25.050
that was very eye-catching.

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:26.680
It was a

00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:28.770
Bamboo Carved Amulet.

00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:34.120
And,

00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:35.220
I saw it last night.

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:36.800
Hey, lower your voice.

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:37.680
What are you saying?

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:39.380
The siblings have been reunited.

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:40.440
Isn't that great?

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:41.120
What are you doing?

00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:41.960
It's spilling!

00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:44.050
That was hot!

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:45.200
Listen.

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:46.880
You'd better keep this to yourself.

00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:48.770
If you tell anyone about it,

00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:50.440
I'll break your legs.

00:21:57.230 --> 00:21:57.920
Huai'an

00:21:58.470 --> 00:21:59.160
doesn't want her to know

00:21:59.160 --> 00:21:59.960
that she's a member of the Liu family.

00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:01.880
He said every member of the Liu family was ill-fated.

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:08.440
Indeed.

00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:10.640
And, they don't live long either.

00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:14.050
If he doesn't make it this time...

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:16.360
If he passes away...

00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:20.600
I will need to be on the run again.

00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:23.960
Don't worry.

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:26.680
If anything happens to Huai'an,

00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:28.770
I'll drag you down with him at the first time.

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:34.810
What has this got to do with me?

00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:36.090
It's because you're a jinx.

00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:39.360
He'll be fine.

00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:40.200
Grand Preceptor already said

00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:41.880
that he could live until the age of 83.

00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:42.960
Grand Preceptor?

00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:44.530
Which one?

00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:46.530
The one who was in power when my father was still the emperor.

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:47.300
Cen Weizong.

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:48.440
Cen Weizong?

00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:49.850
He's a renowned fortune-teller.

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:51.880
That's why I said his prediction will be accurate.

00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:53.400
When did he get his fortune told?

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:55.680
It was when...

00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:57.400
Ten...

00:22:57.540 --> 00:22:58.570
I think when he was 12.

00:22:59.230 --> 00:22:59.850
Huai'an was on the run

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:01.160
when he was 12.

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:02.360
He wouldn't have the time to have his fortune told.

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:04.000
Grand Preceptor told my fortune

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.370
when I was 12.

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:07.330
He said

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:08.770
I could live until the age of 83.

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:10.440
How could I live until 83

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:11.810
without Xie Huai'an's protection?

00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:13.810
If I do live until 83,

00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:15.050
doesn't that mean he'll be protecting me

00:23:15.050 --> 00:23:16.090
until he's 83?

00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:18.090
That's why Xie Huai'an can live until 83 as well.

00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:22.090
Don't worry about it.

00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:25.490
Here.

00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:35.290
So bitter.

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:41.770
I'll accomplish

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:44.810
the task you assigned once it's dawn.

00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:47.050
But I have limited capabilities.

00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:50.490
Your revenge is executed step by step.

00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:54.120
If you wish to seek complete revenge,

00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:58.290
you have to wake up

00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:01.640
and do it yourself.

00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:23.120
What are you staring at?

00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:24.360
There's only one bowl here.

00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:27.810
I can't believe

00:24:27.810 --> 00:24:29.050
that the lady only kept one bowl

00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:29.880
and one teacup at her house.

00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:39.730
Is he okay?

00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:41.400
He's fine.

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:42.440
He's still unconscious.

00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:43.880
I have something to do outside.

00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:45.360
You're leaving at this moment?

00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:48.570
Xiaoqing told me what happened.

00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:50.490
Huben attacked you guys out of the blue.

00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:52.090
And, it was a huge commotion.

00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:53.490
I'm sure security in the city

00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:54.920
will be tightened.

00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:57.010
They won't wreak havoc again.

00:24:57.430 --> 00:24:58.400
If you're still worried,

00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:00.290
tell Commander Wang to send his men here to keep a secret watch.

00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:01.160
Everything will be fine.

00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:02.730
Okay.

00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:03.960
Please go ahead.

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:04.880
I'll keep an eye on him.

00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:06.810
You can have the noodles.

00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:21.920
Why don't you have them?

00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:27.730
Really?

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:44.360
It smells great.

00:25:45.790 --> 00:25:46.330
In the future,

00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:47.680
you can be my bookboy.

00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:49.160
Or my cook.

00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:02.640
Miss, come and take a look.

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:05.110
Look at all the varieties.

00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:05.850
Let's take a look.

00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:06.840
Please take a look.

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:07.760
- Excellent goods for sale. - What do you think?

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:08.600
How much?

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:09.620
This one?

00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:10.850
It suits you.

00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:11.810
You can have it for one wen.

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:12.350
It's raining!

00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:13.010
Let's go!

00:26:18.670 --> 00:26:19.330
Hurry up.

00:26:27.270 --> 00:26:28.600
Please come again tomorrow.

00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:32.440
These accessories are very pretty.

00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:34.680
I wish to buy some after the rain stops.

00:26:34.681 --> 00:26:45.035
(Watch on www.dramacool.club Support Admin)

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:35.600
Sure.

00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:36.600
Thank you.

00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:51.570
Miss, you've truly done me a huge favor.

00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:54.490
These accessories aren't made with gold or jade.

00:26:54.550 --> 00:26:55.600
I wouldn't be able to sell them out

00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:57.010
if they were drenched.

00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:58.200
Don't mention it.

00:26:58.580 --> 00:26:59.600
But judging from your accent,

00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:00.850
I don't think you're from Chang'an.

00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:03.440
I'm not that lucky.

00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:05.640
Both my husband and I came from Huzhou.

00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:06.540
We operate a small business

00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:08.010
in Chang'an to make a living.

00:27:08.250 --> 00:27:09.350
In Chang'an,

00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:10.440
food is expensive.

00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:11.250
But rent is even more expensive.

00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:12.530
It's tough to live here.

00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:14.360
Since that's the case,

00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:16.010
why didn't you guys return to Huzhou?

00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:18.500
I've tried to persuade my husband for many years.

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:20.920
But he always told me

00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:22.490
that we should give it a little more time.

00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:24.080
He kept saying that.

00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:25.160
And now,

00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:26.680
our daughter is already six years old.

00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:28.140
Even so, he's still unwilling to leave.

00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:30.680
I wonder why.

00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:35.850
Miss, what about you?

00:27:36.790 --> 00:27:38.150
You owe someone a blood debt.

00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:42.810
That's why you can't leave.

00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:48.640
Miss, what do you mean?

00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:55.570
Isn't this my daughter's bangle?

00:27:56.270 --> 00:27:57.440
Why do you have it with you?

00:27:58.540 --> 00:27:59.770
Head back and tell your husband this.

00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:01.770
It's time for him to clear the debt

00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:03.160
he owed 15 years ago.

00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:05.420
Your daughter will return to you

00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:09.290
once he does so.

00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:19.680
It doesn't seem like

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.400
the rain will stop anytime soon.

00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:05.200
Father.

00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:18.270
Are you cold?

00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:20.880
Yes.

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:23.440
If this keeps up,

00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:25.640
you won't be able to survive.

00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:28.920
But Father, I lost you.

00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:31.200
Initially,

00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:33.290
I could've saved you.

00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:36.490
I don't want to live anymore.

00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:40.360
Whenever you face this moment,

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:43.010
you have to find a reason to live.

00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:57.330
I took my sister

00:29:58.510 --> 00:30:00.400
out of the Grand Preceptor's Residence.

00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:03.050
After we got out of the city,

00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:05.470
we walked 70 li.

00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:08.290
And, we arrived at Nanwei Trough.

00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:10.120
It was too cold.

00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:11.680
We were starving.

00:30:12.770 --> 00:30:14.680
I couldn't walk anymore.

00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:16.880
In the town,

00:30:17.330 --> 00:30:18.810
there wasn't a single oil lamp.

00:30:19.910 --> 00:30:21.080
There was no fire at all.

00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:23.810
But my sister and I...

00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:28.730
We wanted to have some hot soup.

00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:30.520
I hid her

00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:33.560
in a thatched hut by the roadside.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.140
And, I left.

00:30:36.390 --> 00:30:37.520
When I found some food

00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:39.170
and returned to the hut,

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:40.730
my sister

00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:43.930
was already taken away

00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:45.520
by a kind-hearted individual.

00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:04.040
She was so young.

00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:05.930
She wouldn't have survived

00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:08.520
had she followed me.

00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:11.360
Perhaps she would be able to grow up safely

00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:15.520
if she weren't a member of the Liu family.

00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:17.730
After that,

00:31:18.670 --> 00:31:20.930
I hid among the reeds of Nanwei Trough

00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:22.690
and sustained myself for seven years

00:31:24.050 --> 00:31:25.680
as I watched over her.

00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:28.600
Her foster family

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:31.850
treated her kindly.

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:36.770
You've already done a great job.

00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:40.290
Can you still live on?

00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:54.850
I... I'm so worn out.

00:31:58.430 --> 00:31:59.160
Why don't you

00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:01.290
hang on for a little longer?

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:04.600
Until the next blooming season?

00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:07.960
I just think

00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:09.680
that my son

00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:13.050
deserves to see the flowers bloom again.

00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:15.250
After the blooming season,

00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:18.920
I can wait just a little longer.

00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:26.570
Once the falling petals and drifting rain of July end,

00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:29.280
I can wait just a little longer.

00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:32.560
I can wait until my spouse fixes a meal for me.

00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:34.360
We lead a peaceful life

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:37.770
as we wait?

00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:43.120
On the surface,

00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:45.560
it seems like a good life.

00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:48.210
It's a life of just getting by.

00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:09.250
Father, your hands are so cold.

00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:18.170
You were hunted down.

00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:22.080
No matter how I tried to catch up,

00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:25.770
I could never catch up to that carriage.

00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:28.650
- Father! - I could only stare.

00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:31.650
You were stabbed many times.

00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:34.730
- Blood was everywhere. - Father!

00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:39.210
That was my last image of you.

00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:42.300
As a son,

00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:45.360
from now on,

00:33:48.190 --> 00:33:49.730
I merely live

00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:53.170
to avenge you.

00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:59.250
I don't want you to lead a life like this.

00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:00.590
But I want to.

00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:04.280
Even if I have to sacrifice everything,

00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:07.730
I won't hesitate at all.

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:38.540
What should I do

00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:39.570
if you never wake up?

00:34:42.590 --> 00:34:43.880
Don't tell me you're already...

00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:45.570
You'd better get out if you keep spouting nonsense like that.

00:34:58.630 --> 00:34:59.530
I think he talked just now.

00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:00.920
Come here.

00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:03.800
What did he say?

00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:06.170
I think he's trying to say

00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:09.610
that he wants to find

00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:11.650
his mother.

00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:17.360
I want some water.

00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:20.280
Water?

00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:21.360
He wants water.

00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:21.940
Hurry.

00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:23.090
I'll go and get some.

00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:27.650
How is it?

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:28.570
Has he regained consciousness?

00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:29.530
He talked just now.

00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:30.280
Yeah.

00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:32.050
He said he wanted to find his mother,

00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:33.400
and he wants water.

00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:41.170
He's saying

00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:44.050
that he wants to seek revenge.

00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:53.790
Huai'an?

00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:55.420
Huai'an, you're awake.

00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:55.960
Huai'an?

00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:57.530
Finally, my bodyguard is awake.

00:36:15.590 --> 00:36:16.770
How long was I out?

00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:18.770
Two days.

00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:24.170
Be careful.

00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:41.850
Regarding the task I told you...

00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:43.290
Don't worry about it.

00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:44.810
Everything has been arranged.

00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:46.170
He hasn't left the city yet.

00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:49.610
Good.

00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:55.520
He hasn't left the city, huh?

00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:01.850
That means I still stand a chance to hunt him down.

00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:06.040
Hunt him down?

00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:07.880
Hunt who?

00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:09.880
Liu Ziyan.

00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:14.000
He doesn't deserve to live until now.

00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:36.550
Sir.

00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:43.850
All three divinations forebode misfortune.

00:38:59.110 --> 00:39:00.210
You're leaving the city at this hour?

00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:01.360
I'm running an errand for the Peacekeeper Corps.

00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:02.920
Sir, I have no choice either.

00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:05.080
This is the official letter and travel pass.

00:39:06.330 --> 00:39:06.910
You may pass.

00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:08.290
Thank you, sir.

00:39:24.070 --> 00:39:26.450
I've been getting by in Chang'an for many years.

00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:31.350
In the end, I still have to leave this city.

00:40:06.130 --> 00:40:06.730
What's wrong?

00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:08.960
The carriage hit a rock.

00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:15.990
It's dark out there.

00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:17.680
Be careful.

00:40:57.420 --> 00:40:58.520
If I die now,

00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:01.830
you'll never find out

00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:03.220
what your father

00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:05.650
told me

00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:08.480
before his death.

00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:11.770
It doesn't matter.

00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:14.600
That no longer matters

00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:16.070
to me.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:03.810
Young Master!

00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:06.730
I had no choice either back then.

00:42:07.230 --> 00:42:08.040
If I didn't help him out,

00:42:09.110 --> 00:42:09.810
I would've been dead!

00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:12.080
If I didn't stab your father,

00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:14.730
my parents would've been killed!

00:42:15.790 --> 00:42:16.850
I was selfish.

00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:18.250
I was a coward.

00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:21.690
I deserve to die!

00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:27.000
But you see,

00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:29.360
my daughter is innocent.

00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:31.690
You can do whatever you want to me.

00:42:33.070 --> 00:42:35.730
But please spare my daughter!

00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:50.250
You've settled your debt.

00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:54.770
You may reunite with your family.

00:43:05.550 --> 00:43:07.170
Young Master, thank you!

00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:10.440
Young Master, thank you for your kindness!

00:43:12.110 --> 00:43:14.730
Thank you so much!

00:43:21.630 --> 00:43:22.520
My dear girl.

00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:23.810
Hurry.

00:43:24.070 --> 00:43:24.770
Greet your father.

00:43:24.770 --> 00:43:25.440
Father.

00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:26.420
Sweetie, let Daddy give you a hug.

00:43:27.550 --> 00:43:28.230
Father,

00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:29.360
you're drenched.

00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:30.730
I'm fine.

00:43:31.110 --> 00:43:31.830
I'm fine.

00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:34.880
Let me wipe you dry.

00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:41.850
I thought you would kill him.

00:43:46.590 --> 00:43:47.650
I'm different from those people.

00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:50.480
Let's go.

00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:52.330
Let's head home.

00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:53.520
Okay.

00:43:54.190 --> 00:43:54.770
Let's head home.

00:43:55.750 --> 00:43:56.480
Let's head home.

[Liu Ziwen]

00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:10.480
On the 7th day of the 12th month

00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:12.170
in the 17th year of Qiansheng,

00:46:12.940 --> 00:46:15.330
we encountered the body of General Liu Ziwen along the road.

00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:17.650
Our hearts were heavy with grief.

00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:20.660
We, mere commoners,

00:46:21.070 --> 00:46:22.560
respecting the name

00:46:22.630 --> 00:46:24.080
and virtue of the General,

00:46:24.270 --> 00:46:25.730
pooled our efforts

00:46:26.190 --> 00:46:28.210
to give him a proper burial here.

00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:29.920
We performed the rites on behalf of future generations,

00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:31.850
placed him in his coffin,

00:46:31.900 --> 00:46:33.290
and interred him in his tomb, so as to comfort

00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:36.170
the heroic spirit of the General.

00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:07.250
Father.

00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:12.040
So, you were here all along.

00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:14.360
The city of Chang'an

00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:17.460
has never forgotten about you.

00:47:25.740 --> 00:47:26.450
Father.

00:47:27.210 --> 00:47:28.940
I'm still alive.

00:47:29.550 --> 00:47:31.330
My sister is alive as well.
