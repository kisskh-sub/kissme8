00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.032
(Roadsound Welfare Home)

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:13.810
You said to send another car

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:14.530
to pick me up.

00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:15.889
Where's the car?

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:17.490
How much longer?

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:21.169
Hello.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.810
(Villagers feared her)

00:02:28.169 --> 00:02:29.770
(Temple of the Righteous Lord)
and worried she'd return to feast.

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:32.569
So they pooled funds to build
a Temple of the Righteous Lord.

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.409
The Temple of the Righteous Lord
is the Temple of Zhong Kui.

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:38.370
The temple enshrines
Lord Zhong Kui himself.

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.970
Watch your step. Be careful.

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:45.889
I thought

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.729
to plant an osmanthus tree in the yard

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:52.889
and retire here peacefully.

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:55.889
But I'm used to living where I am,

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:57.569
too lazy to move

00:02:58.409 --> 00:02:59.729
or to tidy up.

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:02.770
So it's left uninhabited.

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:06.609
Make do with this for now.

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:08.129
Thank you, Jiang.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.129
I found you a housekeeper named Ms. Lu.

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:14.009
She's hardworking and a decent cook.

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:15.530
She'll be here soon.

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:17.289
Let me show you around.

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:44.250
You must be Mr. Lu.

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:45.689
Sorry for the wait.

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:46.609
Fine. I came early.

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:47.849
Want a drink?

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.009
No, thanks. Let's get to the point.

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.810
I'm very bullish on your Ninja Duck.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:54.729
Hermit Duck.

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:58.650
It's called Hermit Duck.

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:02.250
H-Hermit...

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:03.370
Hermit.

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:05.530
H-Hermit Duck.

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:08.090
H-Hermit Duck, right?

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:10.009
Alright. Hermit Duck.

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:11.609
May I ask

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:13.490
why you favor Hermit Duck?

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:17.130
Because it can make money.

00:04:17.929 --> 00:04:18.650
I mean it.

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:20.249
It will be popular.

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:21.770
I mean, really popular.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.450
Well, you can constantly

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:24.409
release new skins.

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:30.609
You took the Huoquan Pills?

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:32.849
What's wrong with you?

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:34.169
Why did you take that?

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:35.289
Wait for me.

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:36.849
Luo.

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:40.210
This is my choice.

00:04:44.028 --> 00:04:46.104
Mad Dog leads the charge,
Mad Blade stays in command,

00:04:46.104 --> 00:04:48.184
Enter the Twilight Chasm,
fiends hunt human monsters.

00:04:48.184 --> 00:04:49.824
Blades and hounds
walk the Turquoise Land.

00:04:49.824 --> 00:04:51.224
Ghost Whip cracks his glowing whip.

00:04:51.224 --> 00:04:52.784
Seven hounds, two whips, and one blade.

00:04:52.784 --> 00:04:54.010
The Golden Gate holds firm.

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:55.280
Patrolled every four years.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.600
No more wrongful deaths in Nanba.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.770
Wraiths and fiends walk separate paths.
South Mountain Hunters risk brief lives.

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:00.800
Mad Dog leads the charge,

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.609
- Mad Blade stays in command...
- Ma.

00:05:03.369 --> 00:05:05.249
Go kowtow to your mother.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.169
We were late
because of the mountain patrol.

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:13.090
Ling

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:15.890
won't blame us.

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:20.210
I'm always told that patrolling
means protection

00:05:20.929 --> 00:05:21.929
and duty.

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:23.489
Yet in the end,

00:05:23.489 --> 00:05:25.929
we didn't even get
to see Ling one last time.

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:27.450
I don't understand

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:30.130
what we are protecting.

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:40.289
I want to quit

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:41.809
the South Mountain Hunters.

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:43.489
If you're determined,

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:45.450
I won't stop you.

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:48.970
But at least after finishing

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:51.609
this patrol.

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:02.249
Rest assured.

00:06:02.249 --> 00:06:03.609
South Mountain Education Center

00:06:03.609 --> 00:06:05.330
is a state-funded boarding school

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:06.770
with qualifications.

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:08.650
I'll take good care of her.

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.169
Eat the dumplings on the way.

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:11.770
Eat up.

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:31.890
Who is this?

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:33.130
Someone jumped.

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:37.409
It's fine.

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:39.210
It's all in the past.

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:40.369
It's fine.

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:43.330
Dad, Mom.

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:44.970
Mom.

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:49.369
Dad!

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:50.929
Little girl, leave here first.

00:06:51.169 --> 00:06:52.130
Let go!

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:52.630
Be good.

00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:01.530
Luo.

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:03.289
Brush your teeth and eat well.

00:07:03.409 --> 00:07:05.289
Don't make Dad angry, okay?

00:07:05.289 --> 00:07:05.929
Okay.

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:08.770
Be careful and stay safe.

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:09.650
Got it.

00:07:10.049 --> 00:07:11.650
Tell Mom to come back early.

00:07:11.729 --> 00:07:13.210
Mom, come back early.

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:14.929
Luo, what is this?

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:18.049
Persimmons and peanuts.

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:20.690
Right, good things will happen
when you wear it.

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:22.130
Keep it safe for me, okay?

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:22.770
Okay.

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:24.530
Beautiful.

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:25.570
Let's go.

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:43.849
Is that beautiful?

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:44.650
Yes.

00:07:44.929 --> 00:07:45.650
Beautiful.

00:07:45.929 --> 00:07:47.450
How about I give you a present?

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:48.169
Okay.

00:07:48.489 --> 00:07:49.249
What is it?

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:54.770
Thanks, Dad.

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:56.450
You're welcome, dear.

00:07:57.570 --> 00:07:59.609
A child's birthday
is the mother's suffering day.

00:07:59.609 --> 00:08:01.289
Should we get Mom a present?

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:02.570
I have one too?

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:04.010
What should we get for Mom?

00:08:05.249 --> 00:08:06.690
Good things ahead.

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:11.970
Beautiful?

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:12.729
Yes.

00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:14.010
I'll put it on for Mom.

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:14.690
Okay.

00:08:29.489 --> 00:08:30.210
Thank you.

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:31.249
Beautiful.

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:32.690
Does it look beautiful?

00:08:32.769 --> 00:08:33.609
Yes.

00:08:33.849 --> 00:08:34.529
Beautiful.

00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:36.050
I will give you one too.

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:36.849
Okay.

00:08:38.009 --> 00:08:39.889
You put in the candles.
I'll get the utensils.

00:08:40.009 --> 00:08:40.570
Okay.

00:08:41.769 --> 00:08:42.889
What color do you like?

00:08:43.529 --> 00:08:46.410
I like purple, pink, and green.

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:47.249
I'll do it.

00:08:47.649 --> 00:08:49.050
You like them all?

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:51.970
You're being greedy.

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:54.290
Then purple, pink,
green, and orange ones

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:55.129
are all yours.

00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:57.410
Let's put them in.

00:08:57.410 --> 00:08:59.369
You've been through
a lot in these years, right?

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:19.090
You're a grown-up now.

00:09:20.609 --> 00:09:21.970
Don't be a crybaby anymore.

00:09:26.849 --> 00:09:27.450
Mom.

00:09:48.649 --> 00:09:49.729
Be good, Luo.

00:09:50.129 --> 00:09:51.050
Mom.

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:52.649
I'm really happy.

00:09:53.649 --> 00:09:54.410
Mom.

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:55.450
I don't regret it.

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:56.849
Mom.

00:09:57.970 --> 00:09:59.170
Mom.

00:10:00.649 --> 00:10:01.369
Be good.

00:10:04.369 --> 00:10:05.330
Live well.

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:09.129
Live the life you want.

00:10:15.129 --> 00:10:16.330
Mom.

00:10:17.489 --> 00:10:20.330
Mom, come blow out the candles.

00:11:19.861 --> 00:11:20.461
Luo.

00:11:21.221 --> 00:11:22.020
Luo.

00:11:23.861 --> 00:11:25.660
Luo, you're awake.

00:11:32.461 --> 00:11:33.300
Who are you?

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:38.981
Stop!

00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:40.020
What's wrong with you?

00:11:40.141 --> 00:11:41.381
Luo, stop.

00:11:42.221 --> 00:11:43.180
D-Don't throw the books.

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:44.180
Don't throw the books.

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:45.981
Don't.

00:11:47.581 --> 00:11:48.221
Don't.

00:11:48.381 --> 00:11:49.020
Wait.

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:50.780
What happened?

00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:51.540
Luo.

00:11:54.341 --> 00:11:56.741
Ms. Lu, Yu Rong.

00:11:58.981 --> 00:11:59.700
Luo.

00:12:02.461 --> 00:12:03.341
Doctor.

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:04.900
She had unconsciousness

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:06.141
due to drowning recently.

00:12:06.501 --> 00:12:07.660
After she woke up,

00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:09.341
her short-term memory was gone.

00:12:11.825 --> 00:12:13.705
Any family history of mental illness?

00:12:14.225 --> 00:12:16.624
Or have you taken any medication lately?

00:12:19.424 --> 00:12:20.424
Probably not.

00:12:21.233 --> 00:12:22.713
Can you answer my questions yourself?

00:12:25.993 --> 00:12:26.633
Luo.

00:12:43.954 --> 00:12:44.993
My apologies.

00:12:44.993 --> 00:12:46.194
Just tell me.

00:12:47.233 --> 00:12:48.034
Are you okay?

00:12:48.633 --> 00:12:49.434
Perfectly fine.

00:12:50.194 --> 00:12:51.314
I have a friend

00:12:51.314 --> 00:12:53.274
who's an expert psychiatrist
at Tongguan Hospital.

00:12:53.394 --> 00:12:54.194
Perhaps I...

00:12:55.074 --> 00:12:57.473
There's nothing wrong
with me physically or mentally.

00:12:57.593 --> 00:12:58.993
You're the one with the problem.

00:12:59.554 --> 00:13:00.993
Stop wasting my time.

00:13:01.794 --> 00:13:02.593
Luo.

00:13:02.753 --> 00:13:03.674
Let go.

00:13:05.954 --> 00:13:06.593
Wait.

00:13:09.993 --> 00:13:11.314
I said let go.

00:13:19.394 --> 00:13:20.274
How's it?

00:13:21.554 --> 00:13:22.833
Hard to tell.

00:13:23.194 --> 00:13:24.194
What do you mean?

00:13:24.513 --> 00:13:25.593
She's in great health.

00:13:25.713 --> 00:13:27.074
Previous injuries have all healed.

00:13:28.353 --> 00:13:29.914
But she's forgotten almost everything

00:13:30.394 --> 00:13:31.593
happened in recent months.

00:13:32.513 --> 00:13:33.993
You met her

00:13:33.993 --> 00:13:35.353
in recent months, right?

00:13:36.314 --> 00:13:37.353
Exactly.

00:13:38.233 --> 00:13:39.674
The most clichéd plot

00:13:39.674 --> 00:13:40.753
happened to me.

00:13:42.593 --> 00:13:43.472
Mad Blade medicine.

00:13:43.472 --> 00:13:45.674
Rage. Channeled energy.
Strength up, veins bursting.

00:13:45.674 --> 00:13:47.554
Win big, lose more.
Trades life for victory.

00:13:48.753 --> 00:13:50.593
Can only be used as a last resort.

00:13:51.993 --> 00:13:53.194
She's only alive now

00:13:53.954 --> 00:13:55.473
thanks to that cavern filled

00:13:55.473 --> 00:13:57.233
with Yuwang Meat
beneath the chasm water.

00:13:58.873 --> 00:14:00.194
When you South Mountain Hunters

00:14:00.194 --> 00:14:02.194
developed such a medicine,

00:14:02.513 --> 00:14:04.353
why didn't you develop an antidote too?

00:14:04.554 --> 00:14:06.674
You are the heir
of Roadsound Pharmaceuticals.

00:14:07.074 --> 00:14:08.914
Get your team to develop one.

00:14:09.394 --> 00:14:10.513
Do you know how long

00:14:10.513 --> 00:14:12.233
it takes to develop a drug

00:14:12.233 --> 00:14:13.394
from research to launch?

00:14:14.434 --> 00:14:16.873
Even longer than
rebuilding a relationship

00:14:17.154 --> 00:14:18.833
and spending a lifetime with her?

00:14:37.034 --> 00:14:38.194
Look at this.

00:14:38.394 --> 00:14:39.353
Recall anything?

00:14:39.954 --> 00:14:40.674
No.

00:14:43.274 --> 00:14:44.593
I almost died in the mine,

00:14:44.593 --> 00:14:45.713
and you risked saving me.

00:14:45.713 --> 00:14:46.473
Recall anything?

00:14:46.473 --> 00:14:47.633
How often must I say it?

00:14:47.633 --> 00:14:48.554
I remember nothing.

00:15:02.233 --> 00:15:03.074
Wait, Luo.

00:15:05.674 --> 00:15:06.274
Not that one.

00:15:06.274 --> 00:15:07.233
It's a limited edition.

00:15:08.753 --> 00:15:09.674
Wait, listen...

00:15:15.921 --> 00:15:16.761
Looks good.

00:15:16.761 --> 00:15:19.561
You said you two
are old friends and comrades.

00:15:20.177 --> 00:15:21.096
As an artist,

00:15:21.657 --> 00:15:22.897
it's quite normal to be fickle.

00:15:23.336 --> 00:15:25.496
Diversity prevents creative stagnation.

00:15:25.697 --> 00:15:26.336
Right?

00:15:26.777 --> 00:15:28.697
I think it's positive. Really.

00:15:28.976 --> 00:15:30.777
Just be patient.

00:15:30.976 --> 00:15:31.616
She'll be fine.

00:15:32.897 --> 00:15:35.457
Miss Nie explores everywhere to gather

00:15:35.537 --> 00:15:36.417
artistic inspiration.

00:15:36.736 --> 00:15:39.336
Like mountain caves
and wilderness temples.

00:15:39.537 --> 00:15:41.777
Did she invite some evil spirits?

00:15:42.057 --> 00:15:42.657
No.

00:15:43.697 --> 00:15:44.297
Impossible.

00:15:44.697 --> 00:15:46.216
Her energy is so strong.

00:15:46.537 --> 00:15:47.657
Evil spirits wouldn't dare

00:15:47.657 --> 00:15:48.496
mess with her.

00:15:48.577 --> 00:15:49.577
It'd be asking for death.

00:17:02.801 --> 00:17:04.962
(No.7 Sculpting Knife, Ebony)

00:17:04.962 --> 00:17:06.161
(50-jin Sculpting Clay)

00:17:07.042 --> 00:17:07.762
Thanks.

00:18:31.202 --> 00:18:33.561
(Trash)

00:18:36.232 --> 00:18:39.976

(For Rent, Price is a Steal)

00:18:55.312 --> 00:19:01.296
(Wanbao Tower)

00:19:17.242 --> 00:19:19.881
(To Lin Ling:
I'm leaving Xicang temporarily.)

00:19:19.881 --> 00:19:23.401
(Want to meet before I leave?)

00:19:29.544 --> 00:19:31.112
(Message Revoked)

00:19:38.522 --> 00:19:40.042
(Agree)

00:20:05.873 --> 00:20:07.032
Mr. Yan.

00:20:07.393 --> 00:20:08.712
Are you available now?

00:20:09.833 --> 00:20:10.472
Coming.

00:20:26.472 --> 00:20:27.472
Excuse me, this seat...

00:20:33.752 --> 00:20:34.512
What's wrong?

00:20:40.272 --> 00:20:41.032
Pretty good.

00:20:43.313 --> 00:20:44.553
Long time no see.

00:20:45.073 --> 00:20:46.512
You've changed a lot.

00:20:48.353 --> 00:20:49.153
Have I?

00:20:51.073 --> 00:20:52.232
You've become shyer.

00:21:01.593 --> 00:21:03.313
'Relax' Pine, a potted plant.

00:21:03.672 --> 00:21:04.432
For you.

00:21:04.913 --> 00:21:07.153
May you be relaxed

00:21:07.472 --> 00:21:08.393
and carefree.

00:21:14.833 --> 00:21:15.593
A little pine.

00:21:17.313 --> 00:21:18.113
Grow up now.

00:21:18.992 --> 00:21:20.913
Green leaves and new sprouts.

00:21:26.353 --> 00:21:28.113
Why does this feel like a farewell?

00:21:29.633 --> 00:21:30.752
A farewell gift for me?

00:21:34.192 --> 00:21:36.672
Since we've both survived hardships,

00:21:37.073 --> 00:21:39.153
we both want a fresh start.

00:21:40.512 --> 00:21:42.393
Let's pretend
that it's the first time we meet.

00:21:42.992 --> 00:21:44.593
And this is a welcome gift for you.

00:21:52.032 --> 00:21:54.073
But I came unprepared.

00:21:54.432 --> 00:21:56.032
Like I'm not sincere.

00:21:56.153 --> 00:21:57.833
Well, I'll treat you to ice cream.

00:22:00.272 --> 00:22:03.313
Sir, two of those ice desserts.

00:22:03.313 --> 00:22:05.328
Alright. Takeaway or staying?

00:22:09.353 --> 00:22:10.952
(You're the 66th customers)

00:22:10.952 --> 00:22:12.272
(in our shop today.)

00:22:12.393 --> 00:22:14.833
We've prepared three gifts
for you to choose from.

00:22:14.833 --> 00:22:15.593
Pick one.

00:22:15.793 --> 00:22:16.512
Pick one.

00:22:17.432 --> 00:22:19.952
I'll pick this one.

00:22:48.393 --> 00:22:49.153
Where's he?

00:22:49.633 --> 00:22:50.432
Mr. Yan?

00:22:51.192 --> 00:22:51.833
He left.

00:22:53.393 --> 00:22:54.272
Why?

00:22:55.272 --> 00:22:56.712
You don't want him to be here.

00:22:57.272 --> 00:22:59.073
I think he found it awkward
to stay here,

00:22:59.073 --> 00:22:59.992
so he left.

00:23:29.937 --> 00:23:31.416
What did Ms. Lu say?

00:23:32.785 --> 00:23:34.305
She told me to get some fresh air.

00:23:34.825 --> 00:23:36.184
Stop treating her like a child,

00:23:36.385 --> 00:23:37.704
coaxing and indulging her.

00:23:37.704 --> 00:23:38.664
That won't work.

00:23:40.752 --> 00:23:42.025
Not sure if she's comforting me

00:23:42.025 --> 00:23:43.385
or just trying a desperate mean.

00:23:44.105 --> 00:23:45.625
Ms. Lu makes a good point.

00:23:46.385 --> 00:23:47.424
Don't go back just yet.

00:23:48.385 --> 00:23:49.105
Why?

00:23:49.825 --> 00:23:51.305
The more you coax her,

00:23:51.744 --> 00:23:53.144
the less she cares for you.

00:23:53.904 --> 00:23:55.184
Keep some distance from her,

00:23:55.585 --> 00:23:57.625
and she might see your value.

00:23:57.649 --> 00:23:58.449
Exactly.

00:23:59.290 --> 00:24:00.530
To achieve something,

00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:02.010
try to go against the grain.

00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:04.369
The more you seek strength,

00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:05.969
the weaker you must appear.

00:24:06.369 --> 00:24:07.449
The more you desire,

00:24:07.810 --> 00:24:08.969
the more you must let go.

00:24:09.610 --> 00:24:10.409
The same to her.

00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:12.409
The harder she recalls,

00:24:13.050 --> 00:24:14.169
the more she'll forget.

00:24:16.449 --> 00:24:18.530
Learn this wisdom at the archery range?

00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:23.250
If you focus too hard on the bullseye,

00:24:23.689 --> 00:24:25.050
your form will fall apart.

00:24:25.689 --> 00:24:26.770
Score drops.

00:24:27.209 --> 00:24:27.889
Then,

00:24:29.169 --> 00:24:30.250
what should I do?

00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:32.129
To draw the bow,

00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:34.129
not only arm strength alone needed,

00:24:34.729 --> 00:24:35.810
but also relaxation.

00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:38.209
Engage every muscle in your body

00:24:38.409 --> 00:24:39.330
to draw the bow fully.

00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:41.929
Focus on perfecting every single detail.

00:24:42.209 --> 00:24:43.369
Don't go after the outcome.

00:24:44.944 --> 00:24:46.449
(This applies to you and Nie Jiuluo.)

00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:49.649
(Treasure her and you at the moment.)

00:24:50.409 --> 00:24:51.610
(Let the fate work.)

00:25:41.664 --> 00:25:43.248
(Joy Comes Upon, Moving Forward)

00:26:51.409 --> 00:26:52.330
Wherever you go,

00:26:52.330 --> 00:26:53.609
you need my permission first.

00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:56.850
Okay.

00:26:57.290 --> 00:26:58.649
But solving things with words,

00:26:58.649 --> 00:26:59.409
not fists.

00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:00.129
Okay.

00:27:01.169 --> 00:27:02.730
But it depends on the situations.

00:27:02.929 --> 00:27:03.850
Extreme ones excluded.

00:27:05.689 --> 00:27:06.290
Okay.

00:27:08.409 --> 00:27:10.570
Chat with me
for at least fifteen minutes every day.

00:27:12.889 --> 00:27:13.730
Okay.

00:27:14.409 --> 00:27:15.770
But it depends on the topics.

00:27:15.969 --> 00:27:17.169
The ones I hate excluded.

00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:17.850
Okay.

00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:19.369
Read five stars every day.

00:27:19.969 --> 00:27:20.770
Let's work together

00:27:20.770 --> 00:27:22.129
to regain your memory.

00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:23.449
Okay.

00:27:24.209 --> 00:27:25.689
But I'll only open and read them.

00:27:25.969 --> 00:27:27.129
I won't fold them back.

00:27:27.209 --> 00:27:27.770
Okay.

00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:32.929
Travel with me.

00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:35.169
Short trips.

00:27:35.290 --> 00:27:36.090
Three days maximum.

00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:42.369
Okay.

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:43.689
Really?

00:27:44.689 --> 00:27:45.449
Fine, forget it.

00:27:45.689 --> 00:27:46.969
No, we're definitely going.

00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:47.889
It's settled then.

00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:06.929
This is tacky and ugly.

00:28:06.929 --> 00:28:08.129
Why are you hanging it here?

00:28:08.449 --> 00:28:09.369
Don't touch it.

00:28:09.530 --> 00:28:11.409
It's my treasure.

00:28:16.969 --> 00:28:17.770
Well,

00:28:18.689 --> 00:28:19.810
how many minutes left today?

00:28:21.169 --> 00:28:22.369
I set an alarm.

00:28:22.369 --> 00:28:23.649
It'll ring when time's up.

00:28:23.969 --> 00:28:25.689
It's okay to end the conversation now.

00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:26.689
No way.

00:28:26.689 --> 00:28:27.929
We agreed on fifteen minutes.

00:28:28.129 --> 00:28:28.850
Make them count.

00:28:30.929 --> 00:28:33.169
Well, you drove me
up the mountain overnight,

00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:35.169
made a natural fire for me at the peak,

00:28:35.169 --> 00:28:36.010
and saved my life.

00:28:36.010 --> 00:28:37.090
You remember that, right?

00:28:38.409 --> 00:28:39.570
I caught your lie.

00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:42.250
Didn't you say I saved you in the mine?

00:28:42.250 --> 00:28:43.649
Why mention the natural fire now?

00:28:43.850 --> 00:28:45.170
You saved me twice.

00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:46.490
First time with the natural fire.

00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:47.730
Second time in the mine.

00:28:48.169 --> 00:28:48.929
As a grown man,

00:28:48.929 --> 00:28:50.369
you need me to save you twice?

00:28:51.152 --> 00:28:52.225
I've saved you too.

00:28:52.225 --> 00:28:53.584
When you got hurt at the shipyard,

00:28:53.584 --> 00:28:55.010
I showed up in time.

00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:55.649
That was...

00:29:03.389 --> 00:29:03.889
Fine.

00:29:03.889 --> 00:29:06.169
Save it for next time.

00:29:23.889 --> 00:29:24.449
Here.

00:29:39.770 --> 00:29:40.889
What? What do you need?

00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:50.250
Have I had this noodle before?

00:29:50.889 --> 00:29:52.369
Yes, you have.

00:29:53.409 --> 00:29:54.810
When you went rescue Mr. Crip,

00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:55.889
I was hurt by Locust.

00:29:55.889 --> 00:29:57.290
And you made a natural fire for me.

00:29:58.129 --> 00:29:59.250
Later, Jiang got captured

00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:00.449
and you came to me. Remember?

00:30:05.929 --> 00:30:06.689
Jiang?

00:30:06.929 --> 00:30:07.570
Yes.

00:30:11.290 --> 00:30:12.050
Mad Blade.

00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:22.610
Jiang.

00:30:28.945 --> 00:30:30.425
It's okay, Luo.

00:30:32.945 --> 00:30:33.625
It's okay.

00:30:35.465 --> 00:30:36.344
Luo.

00:30:37.704 --> 00:30:38.224
Luo...

00:31:00.144 --> 00:31:00.704
Asleep?

00:31:48.744 --> 00:31:51.304
(Ms. Lu is excellent.
I've decided to keep her.)

00:31:56.224 --> 00:32:00.105
(The osmanthus tree is blooming.
We'll get to eat osmanthus sauce.)

00:32:05.065 --> 00:32:06.905
(Gave Yan Tuo a haircut.)

00:32:07.144 --> 00:32:10.505
(He should recover soon. Keep it up!)

00:32:19.465 --> 00:32:22.224
(Yan Tuo, Lin Ling,
Ms. Lu, Mr. Changxi.)

00:32:22.385 --> 00:32:25.344
(We had hot pot together as family.)

00:32:25.585 --> 00:32:27.465
(And we saw a meteor shower.)

00:32:36.864 --> 00:32:37.704
Family?

00:32:47.573 --> 00:32:48.293
No way.

00:32:48.573 --> 00:32:49.533
You're making a mess.

00:32:49.533 --> 00:32:50.172
You...

00:32:50.293 --> 00:32:51.652
Others can't get any then.

00:32:54.452 --> 00:32:55.652
You've put your whole face in.

00:32:56.952 --> 00:32:57.452
Hold on.

00:32:57.452 --> 00:32:58.452
Hold on.

00:33:01.452 --> 00:33:02.253
Wait.

00:33:08.732 --> 00:33:09.452
Hello.

00:33:10.492 --> 00:33:11.293
Where are you?

00:33:12.732 --> 00:33:14.932
I-I'm out meeting a client.

00:33:15.373 --> 00:33:16.293
Come back now.

00:33:19.813 --> 00:33:21.452
Today? But I...

00:33:22.373 --> 00:33:23.492
I haven't finished my work.

00:33:23.492 --> 00:33:24.492
How about tomorrow?

00:33:25.333 --> 00:33:26.652
Is it urgent?

00:33:28.813 --> 00:33:29.932
I'll try my best

00:33:30.013 --> 00:33:31.412
to get back early.

00:33:31.732 --> 00:33:32.452
How early?

00:33:35.492 --> 00:33:36.773
If I can go back today,

00:33:36.773 --> 00:33:38.333
can we discuss something?

00:33:38.892 --> 00:33:39.853
Talk when you're back.

00:33:39.853 --> 00:33:41.462
Wait, let's say...

00:33:42.201 --> 00:33:42.864
Hello.

00:33:43.536 --> 00:33:44.437
Hello?

00:33:47.088 --> 00:33:54.800
