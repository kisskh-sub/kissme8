WEBVTT

00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:02.220
It's fall.

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.480
Right before the cultural festival,

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.720
there's always this
tension in the air at school.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.030
Hey, what's up?

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:23.980
It's nothing.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.550
And as for me...

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.590
I still haven't answered that confession.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:34.590
Watarai-kun.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.270
Could you write down
the costume measurements for me here?

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:40.430
Sure. Let's get the measurements.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:41.960
Hioki, give me a hand.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:43.370
Uh, okay...

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.560
On my end,

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.480
the air was just as tense.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.190
A little higher.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:00.920
Right there.

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.770
What are you so flustered about?

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.650
Huh? I'm not.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.250
I'm not flustered.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.380
When you get all flustered like that,

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:22.690
I think it's really cute.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.090
Oh, come on.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.000
"School Trip: Joined a Group I'm Not Close to"
(Episode 8)

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:33.906
(Episode 8: Cultural Festival, Part 1)
Hioki.

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:34.930
Hmm?

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.640
Sounds like someone's calling for you.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.200
Who is it?

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.530
Oh, it's the guys from my club.

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:45.350
Huh?

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.000
Hey, hey, hey.

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.080
What do you want with Hioki?

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.270
What are you doing?

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.906
Watarai, just wait over there for a sec.

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.440
Okay, but you've got three seconds.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.080
Three seconds?

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.720
He startled me.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.880
What was that just now?

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.970
Did he just give us a look that said,
"Hioki is mine"?

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:15.620
What?

00:03:15.621 --> 00:03:17.470
We've known him longer than he has.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.330
Okay, whatever.
What do you guys need?

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.110
Oh! Right, so here's the thing.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.166
I was just in a game of rock-paper-scissors
to decide who's on duty for the festival.

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.410
- Sorry.
- Huh?

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.840
I lost, so now I'm stuck
on reception duty that day.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.030
So it's really getting to you, huh?

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:36.470
Of course not.

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.140
There's no point pretending now.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.740
It's always been obvious with you.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:43.840
So...

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:44.880
what happened after that?

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.080
Something happened at the beach, didn't it?

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.300
Never mind, I won't push it.

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.010
I'm here to listen whenever
you're ready to talk.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:56.780
But...

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.550
seeing a friend like this...

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.576
does it make things awkward for you guys?

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.830
Well, I mean...

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.269
when you two are
flirting right in front of me,

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:04.510
I don't really know how to act.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.270
But it's not like...

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.550
I hate it.

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.700
If anything, I'm pretty used to it by now.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.740
Hii-oo-kii~

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.080
Ugh...

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.180
You're a really good guy.

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:18.020
Forget it. It's fine.

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:20.730
- Let's get married.
- Hard pass.

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:23.950
- Come here for a sec.
- Huh?

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:34.860
Hioki.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.150
It's not...

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:37.700
I mean...

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.080
Is it really that bad for
me to talk to other people?

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.800
It's not that.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.000
It was just what you were talking about...

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:46.620
Huh?

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:49.530
Oh.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.879
- That was just a joke.
- Then marry me.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:53.880
What?

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.680
Let's get married.

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:59.150
No, wait.

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:01.490
When you say something like that,

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.370
- do you mean...
- Hey, you two over there.

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.930
Sorry to interrupt you two lovebirds.

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.320
You have a visitor.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:10.500
Again?

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:12.420
Who is it?

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:13.920
No.

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.440
This time it's not for Hioki.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:16.760
It's for you.

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:26.550
Do you know her?

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:28.440
Nope.

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.780
What do you think they're talking about?

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:39.650
Isn't it obvious?

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:40.970
A confession.

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:42.530
- A confession.
- Huh?

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.139
I mean, getting called
out at a time like this...

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:48.680
what else could it be?

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.280
Really?

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.600
- Yep.
- It's been happening a lot lately.

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.870
- Like getting ambushed at the school gate.
- I know what you mean.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.530
And right before Christmas...

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:58.890
A confession...

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:07.560
I guess it's about time I...

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:08.720
properly...

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:13.270
Um...

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:16.790
Yes?

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:20.500
This girl...

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:22.480
I think she's in our class...

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:24.190
Um...

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:26.710
C-Could I...

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:28.880
have a word with you?

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:31.370
Huh? With me?

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.520
It's a little hard to talk here...

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:38.020
Right.

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:13.860
I'm sorry

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:15.510
for calling you out here so suddenly...

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:20.580
- I'm in your class...
- Shinonome-san.

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:23.930
Is something wrong?

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:28.150
Um...

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:34.530
This.

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.000
Could you please give this...

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:40.560
to him for me?

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:43.650
To who?

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:46.090
Well...

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:49.790
To Watarai-kun.

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:55.220
I'm sorry.

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:57.120
- I...
- I know.

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:00.450
I know I should

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:03.990
give it to him myself.

00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:09.090
But I'm...

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:11.010
I'm too scared.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.980
Watarai-kun...

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:16.940
Just talking to him,

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:19.440
I feel like everyone is watching me.

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:22.210
Come to think of it...

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:24.780
Back then...

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:26.740
I think people were
gossiping about her a lot.

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:33.330
What is it

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.000
that you like about Watarai?

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:37.140
- Huh?
- Oh, sorry.

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:39.060
You don't have to
answer if you don't want to.

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:40.690
No, it's okay.

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.020
The first time I saw him,

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.230
I thought his face was so beautiful.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.920
Oh, but it's not just his looks, of course.

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.420
Even with someone plain like me,

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:12.120
he's always so gentle.

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:13.970
And it seems like

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:15.970
he really values his friends.

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:19.290
He's always so composed,

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:21.710
cool, and confident.

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:24.200
And his smile is so charming.

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:28.000
How do I put it? He
doesn't feel suffocating.

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:31.060
Things like jealousy or possessiveness...

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:33.820
he seems like he's above all that.

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:48.370
But...

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.250
even if in reality,

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:54.670
he's not like that at all, it's okay.

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:56.560
Huh?

00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:58.440
Even if Watarai-kun

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:02.280
isn't the person I imagine him to be...

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:05.080
even so,

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.090
my feelings won't change.

00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:09.690
So...

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:13.950
please.

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:29.310
- Oh, is it that way?
- Over there, over there.

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.520
- No, geez.
- Excuse me, coming through...

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:40.030
Why me?

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:54.860
Watarai.

00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:58.230
Oh.

00:10:58.960 --> 00:10:59.960
Just now...

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.550
I saw you get called away.

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:05.050
I was a little worried.

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:08.020
What were you two talking about?

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:11.890
It's...

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:20.710
A letter...

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:22.990
I just got it.

00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:28.029
Oh, no, I was just...

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:29.130
I was just asked to...

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:35.150
pass it on...

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:36.520
to you.

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:39.120
Huh?

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:46.200
So the person who wrote this...

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:49.590
it wasn't you.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.240
Sorry.

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:03.420
Oh, sorry.

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:08.930
- Oh... No, no, I'm also...
- Sorry.

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:12.580
Let me be alone for a bit.

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.399
([The Guys] Morisaki:
Get to the art room now!)

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.799
([The Guys] Nakasato:
Something's happened to Hioki!)

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.500
([The Guys] Hotta: Hurry!!)

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:53.770
Huh?

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:24.880
Hioki.

00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:26.350
Huh?

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:27.600
Are you okay?

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:29.040
Huh? What's going on?

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000
No...

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:33.030
I'm not sure myself.

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:34.340
But everyone was saying...

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:37.760
- something happened to you.
- Huh?

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:39.730
No, I was just...

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.170
asked by everyone to clean up in here.

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:43.750
Huh?

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:47.330
Oh.

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:49.270
Oh, so that's what it was.

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:53.660
You really scared me.

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:04.890
Hioki.

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:13.100
I thought...

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:16.240
I thought you hated me.

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:26.730
I'm sorry.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.400
About what happened earlier...

00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:33.800
It's not that I hate you or anything.

00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:38.430
- It's just...
- I know.

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:41.070
Watarai, you didn't do anything wrong.

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:45.980
If anything...

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:48.620
I...

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:52.450
I...

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:58.240
I didn't want to accept it.

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:02.140
That letter from before.

00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:06.050
But...

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:10.160
Shinonome-san...

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:14.270
she looked at me so earnestly

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:17.730
when she told me about you.

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:21.110
And...

00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:24.320
I just got so confused.

00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:29.730
I started to think that maybe...

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:33.180
you should be with a girl like that.

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:38.500
But...

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:43.240
even so,

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:45.420
I...

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:47.560
when I saw your face just now,

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:49.530
it was just so painful.

00:15:57.960 --> 00:15:58.960
I'm sorry.

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:01.350
This is all my fault.

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:05.340
No.

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:06.570
It's not like that.

00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:12.790
But I...

00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:17.987
know you better...

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:24.460
than her.

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:27.260
Yeah.

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:34.000
And for me...

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:36.170
it's more than her,

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:37.920
twice as much,

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.440
ten times, a billion times...

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:44.000
I like you more.

00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:45.970
Yeah.

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:56.280
Huh?

00:16:58.770 --> 00:16:59.870
What did you...

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:02.020
just say?

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:04.690
I said...

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:06.360
I like you more...

00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:09.810
than she does.

00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:17.350
Oh.

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:18.780
Just now, did I...

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:20.640
say "I like you"?

00:17:20.864 --> 00:17:21.720
- Yeah.
- Huh?

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:22.720
Did I say that?

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:24.350
Huh? I did? Wait, huh?

00:17:24.370 --> 00:17:25.370
It just slipped out...

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:29.740
What is it?

00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:33.080
Oh, no, it's just...

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:36.650
Hm?

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:41.740
Wait, is it funny?

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:43.990
No, that's not it.

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:46.500
I think I just smiled
because I'm so relieved.

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:49.260
Relieved?

00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:51.420
Yeah.

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:54.120
Because lately...

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:57.220
I've been feeling so anxious.

00:17:57.950 --> 00:17:58.950
Anxious?

00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:00.410
You?

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:03.980
It was the same last year.

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:07.990
During the whole event,

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:10.870
I got a lot of confessions.

00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:13.570
Yeah.

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:15.340
I heard about that from the others.

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:17.320
And then...

00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:20.110
after so many people confessed to me,

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:23.510
I started getting worried.

00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:25.870
Thinking,

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:28.240
maybe that's how you felt back then too.

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:29.630
Huh?

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:33.030
When someone you
don't like confesses to you.

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:37.500
You're so kind, you'd
have to consider it seriously.

00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:42.570
That's why,

00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:47.870
I started to wonder if you were getting
confessions from other people too.

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:50.000
I couldn't help but let my mind run wild.

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:55.330
I'd just make things up in
my head and feel insecure.

00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:59.710
Thinking, I wish you would
just hurry up and choose me.

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:04.910
It's so lame.

00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:06.830
Seriously.

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:09.480
But...

00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:12.000
now that I've heard how you really feel,

00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:14.630
it's such a relief.

00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:20.410
It doesn't even matter
if you mean it or not.

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:24.750
Just hearing you say you like me...

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:32.530
that alone is enough.

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:41.160
I do mean it.

00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:45.930
Huh?

00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:50.330
I...

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:51.940
I really do like you.

00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:54.290
Watarai.

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:41.520
Um...

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:43.080
Sorry.

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:45.270
Didn't mean to interrupt.

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:46.710
But the door was open.

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:48.050
Oh, uh, no, this is...

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:50.330
Still, your timing sucks.

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:51.880
Hey, what could I do?

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:53.830
It's not like I was trying to spy.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:54.680
Besides,

00:20:54.681 --> 00:20:56.640
you should have closed the door.

00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:57.960
Anyway.

00:20:57.961 --> 00:21:00.260
Just get back to the classroom
before someone else sees.

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:02.000
Alright.

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:09.660
Wait.

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:12.220
Does everyone...

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:14.910
know about us?

00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:17.880
Oh, yeah.

00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:19.670
Apparently...

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:20.880
they've known for a while.

00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:25.180
Oh...

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:27.800
I see.

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:29.270
Yeah.

00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:38.340
Anyway, let's go back.

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:39.460
Wait.

00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:54.910
Yeah?

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:56.320
You kissed me.

00:21:57.570 --> 00:21:58.570
Yeah.

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:00.680
I did.

00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:02.590
Oh.

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:04.460
Yeah.

00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:08.330
Why are you flustered?

00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:10.190
I'm-I'm not... I'm not flustered!

00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:11.780
Uh-huh.

00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:13.090
For the record,

00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:16.120
I only kiss people I like.

00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:18.070
It's a personal rule.

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:30.000
- You're totally flustered.
- I am not!

00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:37.330
I like you.

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:43.360
I like you too.

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:47.440
I know.

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:51.080
Then let's go.

00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:00.946
(Next Episode Preview) (Two Hearts as One)
I like you!

00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:02.110
I like you too.

00:23:02.410 --> 00:23:03.410
Who's that?

00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:05.050
Is that Watarai's girlfriend?

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:08.070
Is it really okay for Watarai to choose me?
