00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:56.759
Big liar

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.600
Shi Feifan is a big liar

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:17.599
Nan Batian

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.000
Nan Batian

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.959
Wake up

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.920
Giving you a chance to redeem yourself

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.200
Nan Batian

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:39.359
A clever way to leave no witnesses

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.760
Lord Han

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:46.079
The land has been sorted out

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:47.400
But it hasn't been allocated yet

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:49.239
If I leave just like this

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.439
Everything I've done before
would be for nothing

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.439
Give me three more days

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:54.840
Just three days

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:04.280
Alright, I promise you

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:19.319
That's great

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.879
Don't fight, don't fight

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.680
There's enough for everyone

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:23.520
We have land now

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:25.120
There's enough for everyone

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.960
This is wonderful

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.360
You ruin your own future

00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:56.639
Do you truly not regret it?

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:07.240
In one's lifetime

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.120
You must do a few things
that make you proud

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:12.120
Big, passionate things

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:14.000
The nation is its people

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:16.120
The people are the nation

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:19.240
So even if I face great danger

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:21.080
No matter the cost

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.840
I will still do it

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:25.560
When I grow old one day

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:27.479
Lying on a rocking chair

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.280
Looking back on my life

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.039
Only then will it all be worth it

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:34.759
Truly meaningful

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.960
Be an official like Shi Feifan

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:40.800
I regret not meeting you earlier

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.199
It's not too late to know you now

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:44.919
Let's use tea instead of wine

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.840
I'll drink a cup with you

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.879
Tea at midnight affects sleep

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:52.280
Alright then

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.280
When we reach the capital

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:55.360
I'll have a good drink with you

00:03:56.719 --> 00:03:57.199
Alright

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:01.680
It's finally done

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.400
The three-day deadline is here

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.000
Lord Shi, it's time to go

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:13.159
Even if I agree to go back with you

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.199
I might not make it back alive

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:17.439
It's not that I don't trust you

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:19.600
But Nan Batian kills without warning

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:22.759
The journey back may be dangerous

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:28.480
Don't worry, Lord Shi

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:30.959
I'll risk my life to protect yours

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:07.680
Shi Feifan

00:05:08.399 --> 00:05:09.839
Do you have anything else to say?

00:05:11.079 --> 00:05:13.879
Your subject Shi Feifan has
completed the resettlement

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.560
Today I return to report in the capital

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.040
Resettlement is complete

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.680
You disregard the law

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:22.199
You killed a prince

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.600
Is this your way of resettling?

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.240
Extraordinary times call for
extraordinary actions

00:05:30.399 --> 00:05:32.160
If I hadn't killed Liang Qing
or divided the land

00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:34.079
The people would have rebelled soon

00:05:34.399 --> 00:05:35.560
Nonsense

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.120
Even with your silver tongue

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:40.480
You can't escape the fact
you killed a court official

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:42.319
If I don't kill the traitor

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.439
Should I let him keep harming the people?

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.839
You

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.240
Dying for the people

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.959
My life is worth it as Shi Feifan

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:52.720
Shi Feifan

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.079
Take a good look at yourself

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.199
You're unbelievably bold

00:05:57.879 --> 00:05:58.720
Tyrant

00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.639
You

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.800
Insulting Your Majesty is
a grave offense

00:06:02.079 --> 00:06:03.600
You should be executed

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:07.199
Your Majesty

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:08.319
Your Majesty

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.160
For the merit he has earned

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.160
Please spare his life

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.759
I, your old subject, will die for him

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:16.519
Father

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.279
Duke of Nan, you failed to teach your son

00:06:19.519 --> 00:06:21.480
Letting Shi Feifan cause a disaster

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.000
For your repeated military merits

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.600
Go home and reflect on your mistakes

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:27.680
Your Majesty

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:29.519
Your Majesty

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:30.879
What did my father do wrong?

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Your Majesty dares to act
but not let me speak?

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.360
Shielding the culprit is unjust

00:06:38.519 --> 00:06:40.240
Letting the people suffer is unkind

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:41.680
Now I have completed my task

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:43.079
Yet Your Majesty wants to punish me

00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:45.240
Believe it or not

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.040
History will judge for itself

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:50.319
Fine, fine

00:06:50.519 --> 00:06:51.839
You have a sharp tongue

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.879
Facing death, you still show no remorse

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:54.920
Guards

00:06:55.319 --> 00:06:56.920
Take Shi Feifan to the Imperial Prison

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.560
Execution at noon tomorrow

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.120
I bear Heaven's mandate

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.920
Shi Feifan disregarded the law

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.399
Violated ancient virtue, killed a prince

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:21.439
The law cannot tolerate this

00:07:22.079 --> 00:07:25.360
Now to uphold order and discipline

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.240
Send Shi Feifan to the Imperial Prison

00:07:28.439 --> 00:07:29.920
Await further punishment

00:07:30.439 --> 00:07:34.199
Announce this to all

00:07:40.519 --> 00:07:41.279
Pass down the order

00:07:41.879 --> 00:07:43.519
Anyone who pleads for Shi Feifan

00:07:43.839 --> 00:07:44.600
Will be executed as well

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:20.959
Shi Feifan

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:25.519
Why are you here?

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.839
As long as I can be with you

00:08:29.439 --> 00:08:31.120
Even if I eat only husks and greens,
I'm not afraid

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.399
Even if I go to the underworld

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.440
I'm willing to go with you

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:43.639
I once wasted my time

00:08:45.279 --> 00:08:46.679
Thought life was nothing special

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:49.559
But right now

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:52.399
I wish I could live a long life

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:56.600
Don't worry

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:58.679
I will get you out for sure

00:09:21.559 --> 00:09:22.159
Thank you

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:26.519
What?

00:09:27.559 --> 00:09:29.080
You've always seen me as a love rival?

00:09:33.399 --> 00:09:34.200
Then you

00:09:35.159 --> 00:09:36.399
What do you plan to do next?

00:09:39.159 --> 00:09:40.759
Go somewhere no one knows me

00:09:41.399 --> 00:09:42.200
Start over

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.480
Take care of yourself

00:09:54.399 --> 00:09:56.000
Please tell Shi Feifan

00:09:57.279 --> 00:09:58.440
We're even now

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.080
How hateful I am, truly.

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:45.000
I wouldn't dare.

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:46.960
I wouldn't dare.

00:10:48.519 --> 00:10:49.840
You must have already, in your heart,

00:10:49.919 --> 00:10:51.559
cursed me tens of thousands of times.

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.320
Your Majesty, you are absolutely right.

00:10:55.919 --> 00:10:56.440
You—

00:10:59.159 --> 00:11:01.679
Sometimes I truly envy you.

00:11:03.759 --> 00:11:04.759
You speak your mind when upset.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.039
You strike out when unhappy.

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.000
No need to weigh or consider.

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:09.240
No need to think of pros and cons.

00:11:10.039 --> 00:11:11.799
I ascended the throne as a child.

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.279
Prime Minister Lü suppressed me.

00:11:13.919 --> 00:11:16.799
I wish to be a good emperor loved by the people.

00:11:18.279 --> 00:11:19.919
But as a ruler,

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:21.519
I am not free to act as I wish.

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:25.080
At just twenty-something years old,

00:11:25.799 --> 00:11:27.120
How can you be so constrained?

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:30.720
You hold the highest position in the land.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.519
Loyal subjects support you, the people adore you.

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:35.000
What could be impossible for you?

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:38.039
Life is not always smooth sailing.

00:11:38.759 --> 00:11:40.080
More often, it is rowing against the current.

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:43.080
If Your Majesty wishes to reach the end faster,

00:11:43.639 --> 00:11:44.919
I do have a suggestion.

00:12:04.039 --> 00:12:04.600
Your Majesty—

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.120
My father spent his life in battle.

00:12:06.399 --> 00:12:07.919
His wounds are countless.

00:12:08.559 --> 00:12:09.480
After yesterday's events,

00:12:09.919 --> 00:12:11.200
he exhausted too much of his strength.

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:12.480
He fell ill as soon as he returned.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.360
I humbly ask Your Majesty

00:12:16.639 --> 00:12:19.679
to allow my father to retire and return home, enjoying his old age.

00:12:38.399 --> 00:12:40.960
Since Elder Shi is unwell,

00:12:41.639 --> 00:12:42.279
I grant your request.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.600
In honor of Elder Shi's loyal service,

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.639
I reward him with ten thousand taels of gold.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:49.320
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:55.639
Last night, my father gave me the Tiger Tally.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.840
But I believe I lack the ability.

00:12:59.399 --> 00:13:01.639
I wish to present the Tiger Tally to Your Majesty.

00:13:02.919 --> 00:13:03.639
And hope Your Majesty

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:06.080
will continue to treat the Shi Family Army well.

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:35.360
It seems the plan must be moved up again.
