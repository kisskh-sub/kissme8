<i>It's that same dream again.</i>

01:10.904 --> 01:14.241
<i>It's that same dream I always dream...
And always forget.</i>

01:22.207 --> 01:23.208
Denji.

01:25.711 --> 01:26.879
Pochita!

01:27.588 --> 01:29.339
Pochita, come out!

01:29.840 --> 01:32.216
We're just in a dream right now.
Let me pet you.

01:32.217 --> 01:33.467
Denji.

01:39.558 --> 01:41.225
Do not open the door. No matter what.

02:02.331 --> 02:04.749
What's going on? You're so loud.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.503
I had a bad dream.

02:18.138 --> 02:19.264
Am I still in a dream?

02:19.806 --> 02:21.265
What are you talking about?

02:27.773 --> 02:30.066
What's going on?

02:30.067 --> 02:33.319
Where did I get all this power?

02:33.320 --> 02:37.032
So this isn't a dream.

CHAINSAW MAN - THE MOVIE:
REZE ARC

05:12.563 --> 05:14.982
DEVIL HUNTER TOKYO HQ BUILDING

05:19.361 --> 05:20.987
What are these horns?

05:20.988 --> 05:24.241
Power, you drank too much blood,
didn't you?

05:24.908 --> 05:26.325
Maybe you drank too much blood

05:26.326 --> 05:28.661
in that fight against the zombies.

05:28.662 --> 05:31.623
- We've got to drain some blood out of you.
- Okay!

05:32.249 --> 05:33.416
Drain her blood?

05:33.417 --> 05:36.003
Power has to have her blood drained
every once in a while,

05:36.795 --> 05:38.921
or else she becomes even more scary

05:38.922 --> 05:41.133
and self-centered than she normally is.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.759
- So that's why... Denji...
- Huh?

05:43.760 --> 05:46.138
Is it okay if I borrow Power for a while?

05:47.931 --> 05:49.016
Hmm...

05:52.603 --> 05:54.145
Take as long as you need.

05:56.148 --> 05:58.901
As for who's going to be your new buddy
while I'm borrowing her,

05:59.568 --> 06:01.820
this guy said
he wants to team up with you.

06:06.992 --> 06:09.453
Lord Chainsaw! Lord Chainsaw!

06:14.124 --> 06:16.251
Who is this guy?

06:16.960 --> 06:18.045
He's the Shark Fiend.

06:18.629 --> 06:21.506
Normally, he's so ferocious that no one
can even have a conversation with him.

06:21.507 --> 06:23.841
But he said that as long as he gets
to pair up with you, Denji,

06:23.842 --> 06:26.845
- he'll do whatever you tell him to.
- He'll do whatever I tell him to do?

06:27.429 --> 06:29.889
- How come?
- I'm not sure.

06:29.890 --> 06:31.390
Maybe it's because your faces look alike.

06:31.391 --> 06:34.393
Lord Chainsaw! I'll do whatever you say!
No matter what! Lord Chainsaw!

06:34.394 --> 06:37.396
You're the best! You're the greatest!
Lord Chainsaw! You're the greatest!

06:37.397 --> 06:40.025
Don't touch me! I'm not into men.

06:45.447 --> 06:48.492
Hmm? You look unhappy.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.663
I feel great.

06:56.792 --> 06:58.501
If you really are feeling great,

06:58.502 --> 07:01.421
then how about going on a date
with me tomorrow on our day off?

07:02.381 --> 07:03.423
A date?

07:07.427 --> 07:10.931
Hooray! Hooray!

07:12.432 --> 07:14.685
Huh? Denji, you're already here.

07:15.269 --> 07:17.645
You're an hour early.

07:20.566 --> 07:22.984
<i>She's so cute! She's so cute!</i>

07:22.985 --> 07:24.820
She's so cute!

07:25.404 --> 07:27.488
Denji, what time did you get here?

07:27.489 --> 07:30.033
I couldn't sleep last night.
I got here at 5:00.

07:30.617 --> 07:33.036
So... what's the plan for today?

07:33.954 --> 07:37.207
I've never hung out with a girl before.

07:38.041 --> 07:43.463
Today, from now until midnight,
we're going to go movie-theater hopping.

07:44.715 --> 07:45.715
What?

07:54.975 --> 07:58.604
<i>Well, this isn't what I was expecting.</i>

08:02.065 --> 08:03.858
<i>Everyone's laughing.</i>

08:03.859 --> 08:06.360
<i>It wasn't that funny!</i>

08:11.450 --> 08:13.744
<i>Makima's not laughing either.</i>

08:14.494 --> 08:16.121
<i>She's so cute.</i>

08:18.290 --> 08:19.917
That was disappointing.

08:20.417 --> 08:22.251
It wasn't very interesting at all.

08:22.252 --> 08:25.130
It looked like they spent a lot of money
making that movie though.

08:26.632 --> 08:29.009
Well, then... let's go to the next one.

08:39.852 --> 08:41.104
<i>Everyone's crying.</i>

08:43.857 --> 08:45.691
<i>She's not crying.</i>

08:45.692 --> 08:46.777
<i>She's so cute.</i>

08:48.111 --> 08:50.112
That was disappointing.

08:50.113 --> 08:53.908
I didn't like how it felt
when they were trying to force us to cry.

08:57.996 --> 09:00.164
At least the music was good.

09:02.417 --> 09:04.794
The story seemed so fake.

09:09.716 --> 09:11.802
It was just average.

09:12.427 --> 09:14.178
The next movie is the last one.

09:14.179 --> 09:15.263
CINEMA

09:15.264 --> 09:18.642
Everyone says this movie
is hard to understand.

09:19.768 --> 09:21.395
Do you want to try watching it, Denji?

09:23.897 --> 09:27.191
Honestly, all the movies
we've seen today are bad.

09:27.192 --> 09:30.070
Maybe I don't get movies or something.

09:30.863 --> 09:35.491
I only find one good movie
for every ten movies I watch too.

09:35.492 --> 09:36.784
Huh?

09:36.785 --> 09:41.206
But one of those
was a movie that changed my life.

10:27.294 --> 10:29.296
<i>Huh? Whoa.</i>

10:30.422 --> 10:33.008
<i>This scene isn't even that important.</i>

10:33.634 --> 10:36.053
<i>I hope Makima doesn't see me!</i>

10:54.238 --> 10:58.032
I'm never going to forget that last scene
until the day I die.

10:58.033 --> 10:59.283
Me too.

10:59.284 --> 11:02.120
That last movie made
the price of the ticket worth it.

11:06.124 --> 11:09.878
Makima, do you think I have a heart?

11:11.129 --> 11:13.131
Why are you asking that question?

11:14.550 --> 11:15.592
Just because.

11:39.283 --> 11:40.533
You do.

11:40.534 --> 11:42.703
I...

11:43.704 --> 11:45.122
I do.

12:13.317 --> 12:14.650
<i>I see...</i>

12:14.651 --> 12:18.905
<i>The fact that I felt butterflies
means that I do have a heart!</i>

12:18.906 --> 12:21.991
Donations, please!
Donations, please! Donations, please!

12:21.992 --> 12:25.954
We're collecting donations for children
who've been victimized by devils.

12:26.580 --> 12:28.080
Donations, please!

12:28.081 --> 12:31.001
I have a heart,
so I can even make a donation!

12:32.503 --> 12:33.754
Thank you very much!

12:34.379 --> 12:37.508
We're giving away flowers
to everyone who makes a donation.

12:38.133 --> 12:39.718
Ah...

12:40.469 --> 12:41.470
It's beautiful.

12:42.221 --> 12:43.514
Huh?

12:48.352 --> 12:50.353
<i>And the fact that
I can feel that the flower is beautiful</i>

12:50.354 --> 12:52.688
<i>also means I have a heart!</i>

12:52.689 --> 12:53.774
Huh?

12:55.776 --> 12:57.778
<i>Makima, you're incredible.</i>

12:58.904 --> 13:01.615
<i>I feel so much better
after talking to you!</i>

13:03.534 --> 13:07.537
<i>Makima said that once I've gathered
all the pieces of the Gun Devil's flesh,</i>

13:07.538 --> 13:09.080
<i>she'll grant me one wish.</i>

13:09.081 --> 13:13.043
<i>In that case... I think I want
to ask her to be my girlfriend.</i>

13:22.219 --> 13:25.513
<i>Whenever I have a free moment,
I always start thinking about Makima.</i>

13:25.514 --> 13:29.350
<i>I've squeezed other girls' boobs
and kissed other girls before too,</i>

13:29.351 --> 13:32.145
<i>but my heart belongs completely to Makima!</i>

13:32.771 --> 13:35.815
<i>There's no way I'm going
to fall for anyone else!</i>

13:40.404 --> 13:42.072
Run away!

13:43.240 --> 13:44.323
Whoo-hoo!

13:44.324 --> 13:45.616
Water! Water!

13:45.617 --> 13:48.453
Water!

13:49.955 --> 13:50.955
Ah.

13:50.956 --> 13:53.541
Beam! You stay hidden!

13:53.542 --> 13:56.627
If anyone sees you, I won't be able
to walk around in public anymore.

13:56.628 --> 13:57.713
Okay!

13:59.840 --> 14:03.135
Why do fiends all have such weird names?

14:15.522 --> 14:18.108
I should have brought an umbrella.

14:25.616 --> 14:29.619
Whoa!

14:32.122 --> 14:33.665
Hello, hello.

14:34.249 --> 14:36.376
It's raining so hard.

14:37.127 --> 14:39.379
Huh? Uh...

14:39.963 --> 14:41.924
The weather report said...

14:43.634 --> 14:44.676
Hmm?

14:45.469 --> 14:48.013
Huh?

14:49.181 --> 14:50.599
Huh? What's wrong?

14:51.099 --> 14:52.935
Sorry.

14:54.353 --> 14:55.854
What's wrong with you?

15:00.567 --> 15:03.319
Huh? How come you're crying?

15:03.320 --> 15:05.030
Sorry.

15:05.781 --> 15:06.990
Your face...

15:07.574 --> 15:09.867
looks like my dog that passed away.

15:09.868 --> 15:13.287
Huh? You're saying I'm a dog?

15:13.288 --> 15:15.916
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

15:20.254 --> 15:22.297
Hmm? Are you okay?

15:25.300 --> 15:26.760
Uh...

15:28.971 --> 15:31.431
Hold on! I've got a handkerchief!

15:34.017 --> 15:35.769
Ta-da!

15:36.436 --> 15:37.895
What?

15:37.896 --> 15:39.022
A magic trick?

15:39.690 --> 15:40.983
That's amazing!

15:41.817 --> 15:44.319
There's no trick to it.

15:48.115 --> 15:49.324
Thanks.

16:03.589 --> 16:05.424
Ah. It stopped raining!

16:06.842 --> 16:10.178
I work at a café called Crossroads
right down there.

16:10.179 --> 16:12.431
If you drop by,
I'll pay you back for this.

16:13.557 --> 16:15.017
Make sure you come, okay?

16:56.975 --> 16:57.976
All right.

16:58.602 --> 17:01.604
You're late.
I'm going to deduct it from your pay.

17:01.605 --> 17:02.731
You're so stingy!

17:03.357 --> 17:05.107
Take this water to table four.

17:05.108 --> 17:07.861
Stingy! Stingy! Stingy! Stingy! Stingy!

17:11.949 --> 17:14.241
Th... That was fast!

17:14.242 --> 17:17.787
Huh? You got here faster than me!

17:17.788 --> 17:19.873
Well, I guess you're right.

17:21.375 --> 17:23.501
I just came so that you could pay me back.

17:23.502 --> 17:25.462
Hmm?

17:29.132 --> 17:31.759
- Oh.
- Let's have a drink together!

17:31.760 --> 17:35.389
Hey! Can you bring some coffee
for me and him?

17:36.181 --> 17:38.015
But you work here.

17:38.016 --> 17:40.017
What's the big deal?

17:40.018 --> 17:42.770
We only get customers
in the morning anyway.

17:45.065 --> 17:46.316
Well...

17:47.776 --> 17:49.778
A cup of coffee is my gift back to you!

17:50.696 --> 17:51.780
Do you like coffee?

17:52.447 --> 17:53.574
I'll drink it.

17:58.120 --> 18:02.123
What's with that face?
You're just pretending you're fine!

18:02.124 --> 18:04.292
Coffee tastes bad!

18:04.293 --> 18:06.295
It tastes like it's from the gutter!

18:09.464 --> 18:11.216
You're just like a little kid!

18:13.343 --> 18:16.930
<i>She's touching me a lot,
and she's laughing at my jokes.</i>

18:17.431 --> 18:18.724
<i>Could it be that...</i>

18:19.516 --> 18:21.101
<i>she likes me?</i>

18:22.769 --> 18:24.313
My name's Reze.

18:24.813 --> 18:25.856
What's your name?

18:26.857 --> 18:27.941
Denji.

18:28.859 --> 18:29.860
Denji?

18:30.694 --> 18:32.070
Denji...

18:36.241 --> 18:39.536
Denji, I've never met someone
as interesting as you.

18:41.079 --> 18:43.331
Huh...

18:43.332 --> 18:45.709
<i>I'm sure about it now. She does like me.</i>

18:47.169 --> 18:48.629
<i>What am I going to do?</i>

18:49.254 --> 18:51.840
<i>I like people who like me too.</i>

18:53.050 --> 18:55.135
<i>Makima... help.</i>

18:56.220 --> 18:59.223
<i>I'm going to start falling for this girl.</i>

19:15.364 --> 19:17.907
You've had three already. That's enough.

19:17.908 --> 19:19.409
We're going to go on patrol now.

19:21.286 --> 19:23.746
Eating ice cream made me tired.

19:23.747 --> 19:26.291
I heard that eating takes energy too.

19:31.713 --> 19:34.174
I don't want to work anymore today.

19:35.050 --> 19:36.717
They found out where the Gun Devil is.

19:36.718 --> 19:38.177
There's going to be an expedition.

19:38.178 --> 19:43.058
In order to participate, I need to have
more experience defeating big devils.

19:43.767 --> 19:47.186
That's why I want to
go look for more devils.

19:47.187 --> 19:50.606
You're my buddy. Please help me out.

19:50.607 --> 19:51.984
Huh?

19:55.153 --> 19:56.780
Hmm...

20:00.200 --> 20:03.036
How about I think about it a bit
after I've had another ice cream?

20:04.580 --> 20:05.581
Get up.

20:06.081 --> 20:08.666
If I tell the leadership
that you're useless,

20:08.667 --> 20:11.879
they're going to kill you as a devil.
Are you sure you're okay with that?

20:13.422 --> 20:14.923
Hmm.

20:19.636 --> 20:22.556
I'd rather die than work.

20:25.893 --> 20:28.519
<i>He's the second-most
powerful member of Division 4,</i>

20:28.520 --> 20:29.688
<i>after Captain Kishibe.</i>

20:31.064 --> 20:33.734
At least he would be
if he weren't always so lazy.

20:34.568 --> 20:37.778
If you want to join the expedition
to defeat the Gun Devil,

20:37.779 --> 20:40.616
then you should try
to make good use of him.

20:41.950 --> 20:44.494
I don't think
I can get along well with a devil.

20:45.120 --> 20:47.998
But you get along with Power, right?

20:48.498 --> 20:51.543
We had a fistfight just this morning.

20:53.504 --> 20:56.256
You don't have to become friends.

20:57.007 --> 20:59.927
Just use him for your own benefit.

21:00.511 --> 21:02.803
He's someone
who killed every single person

21:02.804 --> 21:05.139
in the village where he was born.

21:05.140 --> 21:06.683
Or to put it more accurately:

21:07.392 --> 21:10.437
He sucked the lifespans out of them
and transformed them into weapons.

21:11.188 --> 21:12.189
Weapons?

21:12.773 --> 21:16.526
He has the power to transform the
life of anyone he touches into a weapon.

21:16.527 --> 21:20.446
That katana you have
is one of his weapons too.

21:20.447 --> 21:24.033
Those weapons can do things like cut
through ghosts that no one can touch...

21:24.034 --> 21:26.453
and have different special powers.

21:28.288 --> 21:31.374
It's okay if you have to pretend.
Just be friendly with him.

21:31.375 --> 21:33.961
I'm sure he'll be useful to you.

21:55.274 --> 21:56.859
I've eliminated the devil!

21:57.359 --> 22:00.904
Please make sure
not to touch its blood or its flesh!

22:07.661 --> 22:09.872
Whoa, that looks delicious.

22:11.999 --> 22:13.624
Hey you, human.

22:13.625 --> 22:15.210
Come over here.

22:16.378 --> 22:19.338
He must be a private Devil Hunter.

22:19.339 --> 22:21.883
He was being eaten up by this devil.

22:21.884 --> 22:25.137
The lower half of his body
is gone already. He's almost dead.

22:30.809 --> 22:33.896
Kill me. Kill me.

22:34.521 --> 22:37.273
Your power gives you
the ability to kill him painlessly.

22:37.274 --> 22:38.775
Grant him his wish to die.

22:39.276 --> 22:40.652
Huh? No way.

22:41.320 --> 22:43.655
I may be an angel, but I'm also a devil.

22:44.364 --> 22:47.117
I believe that humans
should suffer when they die.

23:06.261 --> 23:08.805
I don't think we can become friends.
Even if I pretend.

23:10.057 --> 23:11.058
I guess not.

23:14.686 --> 23:17.940
<i>Makima's the one
who found my heart.</i>

23:18.524 --> 23:22.319
<i>So that's why my heart belongs to Makima.</i>

23:23.820 --> 23:26.322
<i>But... my body...</i>

23:26.323 --> 23:27.908
<i>It's moving on its own!</i>

23:30.077 --> 23:32.203
Oh, it's you!

23:32.204 --> 23:33.830
I came to have lunch.

23:34.915 --> 23:38.919
The food here's not that good. No one
would come every day for a whole week.

23:39.545 --> 23:40.837
It's good.

23:40.838 --> 23:42.463
It is good.

23:42.464 --> 23:44.424
You have such bad taste.

23:45.551 --> 23:46.927
Well...

23:47.469 --> 23:50.012
I'll have some curry and some ice cream.

23:50.013 --> 23:51.722
Ah! And some fried rice!

23:51.723 --> 23:55.643
How about you come eat
over here at this table?

23:55.644 --> 23:56.727
I'm fine here.

23:56.728 --> 23:59.981
You're studying right now, right?
Even though you're on the clock.

23:59.982 --> 24:02.775
You don't go to school, right?

24:02.776 --> 24:04.736
Even though you're 16.

24:07.489 --> 24:11.200
I think that's even worse.

24:11.201 --> 24:13.160
Do you really think so?

24:13.161 --> 24:14.495
I see.

24:14.496 --> 24:17.498
You're working as a Devil Hunter
instead of going to school.

24:17.499 --> 24:19.877
You're a weird one.

24:25.424 --> 24:28.050
I'm going to study over here.

24:28.051 --> 24:29.887
Scoot over! Scoot over!

24:34.016 --> 24:36.434
I want to learn how to read kanji.

24:36.435 --> 24:38.145
You can't read kanji?

24:38.729 --> 24:40.355
Then I'll teach you!

24:41.440 --> 24:42.649
Here's a question.

24:43.233 --> 24:44.275
Ta-da!

24:44.276 --> 24:46.235
What does this say?

24:46.236 --> 24:48.779
That says "balls," you sex-crazed girl.

24:48.780 --> 24:51.158
So you do know what it says.

24:51.742 --> 24:54.411
"Balls" is the only one I can read.

24:58.373 --> 24:59.833
That's crazy.

25:05.380 --> 25:08.508
I wish I could have
gone to school with you.

25:08.509 --> 25:10.135
It would have been fun.

25:15.891 --> 25:17.726
<i>What am I saying?</i>

25:22.022 --> 25:23.731
Do you want to go with me?

25:23.732 --> 25:25.692
- At night.
- At night?

25:26.318 --> 25:29.821
Let's go explore
a school building together at night.

25:33.909 --> 25:34.910
Okay.

25:35.953 --> 25:38.080
<i>My heart belongs to Makima,</i>

25:39.122 --> 25:42.042
<i>but my body won't listen to me!</i>

25:53.053 --> 25:54.346
Typhoon.

25:55.055 --> 25:56.056
What is it?

25:56.682 --> 26:01.270
Why do you devils want Chainsaw's heart?

26:02.938 --> 26:04.522
You don't need to know.

26:04.523 --> 26:06.983
The only thing you need to focus on
is holding up your end of the contract

26:06.984 --> 26:08.276
between you and me.

26:08.277 --> 26:12.071
Sounds like we're
going to be working together for a while.

26:12.072 --> 26:14.366
So let's get more comfortable
with each other.

26:15.784 --> 26:18.328
Typhoon Devil.

26:21.540 --> 26:26.502
The contract is that once
I get my hands on Chainsaw's heart,

26:26.503 --> 26:28.714
you'll let me use your powers forever.

26:29.214 --> 26:30.381
Be careful.

26:30.382 --> 26:35.345
The human who has Chainsaw's heart
has killed lots of devils.

26:35.929 --> 26:39.349
That's because
the devils aren't very bright.

26:42.686 --> 26:47.356
I killed a Devil Hunter from China
for a job once.

26:47.357 --> 26:52.613
He was a merciless Devil Hunter.
They said he had no blood or tears.

26:53.488 --> 26:55.741
How did you kill him?

27:02.748 --> 27:05.751
I looked for how I could
make him bleed and cry.

27:06.251 --> 27:09.086
I took his wife and kid as hostages.

27:09.087 --> 27:12.131
Then I skinned them
and showed him their hides.

27:12.132 --> 27:14.217
He let me kill him after that.

27:29.024 --> 27:30.442
Denji, aren't you scared?

27:31.485 --> 27:35.196
Uh, I'm not really scared.

27:35.197 --> 27:36.782
This just feels weird.

27:37.366 --> 27:39.910
What do you mean?

27:45.916 --> 27:48.210
Hey. I'm a little scared.

27:49.461 --> 27:50.754
Can I hold your hand?

28:00.556 --> 28:02.098
<i>Makima.</i>

28:02.099 --> 28:04.893
<i>To be honest,
I don't want to hold her hand.</i>

28:06.687 --> 28:09.814
<i>But my body just...</i>

28:14.152 --> 28:16.696
Who knows the answer?

28:16.697 --> 28:18.281
Me! Me! Me!

28:18.282 --> 28:19.657
Two! It's two!

28:19.658 --> 28:21.285
That's right! You're a genius!

28:22.578 --> 28:26.330
- What does this English word mean?
- I have no idea!

28:26.331 --> 28:28.875
The answer is: "Big ass."

28:28.876 --> 28:30.335
You sex-crazed girl!

28:31.461 --> 28:34.547
Huh... So this is what school is like.

28:34.548 --> 28:36.216
I think I've got the hang of it now.

28:37.843 --> 28:41.220
Denji, is it really true that
you didn't even go to elementary school?

28:41.221 --> 28:42.764
Huh? Yeah.

28:43.390 --> 28:47.852
Isn't that... bad?

28:47.853 --> 28:49.354
Bad?

28:50.230 --> 28:51.648
Well, not bad.

28:52.316 --> 28:53.483
It's weird.

28:55.569 --> 28:58.363
A 16-year-old is still a kid.

28:58.864 --> 29:01.115
Normally, you'd study for entrance exams,

29:01.116 --> 29:04.745
join school clubs,
and go out with friends.

29:05.370 --> 29:09.666
But you... you kill devils
and almost get yourself killed by them.

29:10.209 --> 29:12.543
Is Public Safety,
that place you work at now,

29:12.544 --> 29:14.171
is it really a good place?

29:15.881 --> 29:18.634
Well, it's a really good place, you know.

29:19.343 --> 29:21.135
I get to eat three meals a day.

29:21.136 --> 29:22.846
And I get to sleep on a futon.

29:24.681 --> 29:28.018
But that's the bare minimum
for everyone in Japan.

29:28.519 --> 29:30.479
It's something that's normal for everyone.

29:31.563 --> 29:32.981
Uh...

29:34.441 --> 29:37.236
My head's getting hot
from thinking too hard.

29:39.863 --> 29:40.864
In that case...

29:42.407 --> 29:44.284
Do you want to cool down a bit?

29:54.795 --> 29:57.714
It's so cold!

30:05.639 --> 30:08.141
I don't know
how to swim that well, you know.

30:14.648 --> 30:16.441
Hmm?

30:17.693 --> 30:20.153
Then I'll teach you how to swim.

30:24.408 --> 30:27.703
Huh?

30:29.413 --> 30:30.706
Huh?

30:31.290 --> 30:34.709
Take off your clothes.
Your clothes are going to pull you down.

30:34.710 --> 30:36.711
You're so sexy.

30:36.712 --> 30:39.339
Don't you want to learn how to swim?

30:41.133 --> 30:42.885
I am starting to want to learn.

30:48.307 --> 30:50.475
Denji, you should get naked too.

30:51.810 --> 30:54.313
It's dark. I can't see anyway.

30:55.564 --> 30:57.481
- <i>Calm down!</i>
- <i>I can see everything!</i>

30:57.482 --> 30:58.774
<i>It's my first time seeing nipples!</i>

30:58.775 --> 31:01.527
<i>If I take off my clothes now,
I'll be betraying Makima!</i>

31:06.950 --> 31:08.076
<i>Damn!</i>

31:14.082 --> 31:17.336
Come on! Come over here, Denji!

31:18.337 --> 31:22.507
<i>No, Denji.
If I go, then my heart will go too.</i>

31:22.508 --> 31:24.759
I know what's going on.

31:24.760 --> 31:27.887
You're scared to get in the pool
because you can't swim.

31:31.475 --> 31:33.684
Come on! It feels good!

31:34.937 --> 31:36.437
Hurry up! Come on!

32:56.310 --> 32:57.477
I'll teach you.

32:58.937 --> 33:01.314
I'll teach you things you don't know.

33:01.315 --> 33:02.858
Things you don't know how to do.

33:03.942 --> 33:07.070
I'll teach you everything.

33:13.368 --> 33:15.620
Denji! Breathe! Breathe!

33:29.843 --> 33:31.219
It's raining!

33:31.220 --> 33:32.346
Yeah!

33:36.850 --> 33:37.975
Hyah!

33:55.744 --> 33:58.413
- The rain's not stopping.
- Mmm.

34:05.671 --> 34:07.214
Denji...

34:07.881 --> 34:10.926
The country mouse or the city mouse.

34:11.510 --> 34:13.053
Which one would you rather be?

34:14.012 --> 34:15.304
What are you talking about?

34:16.514 --> 34:18.475
It's one of Aesop's fables.

34:21.395 --> 34:24.272
The country mouse lives a safe life,

34:24.273 --> 34:26.692
but doesn't have delicious food
like the city mouse.

34:27.609 --> 34:30.820
The city mouse can find good food,

34:30.821 --> 34:33.574
but he's in danger of getting killed
by a cat or a human.

34:38.036 --> 34:40.496
I wanted to be the country mouse.

34:41.665 --> 34:46.503
But Makima captured me
and brought me to the city.

34:51.175 --> 34:53.427
My heart belongs in the countryside.

34:54.011 --> 34:57.347
I don't want to follow around a city mouse
like you and put myself in danger.

34:59.224 --> 35:00.225
Hey...

35:04.521 --> 35:07.106
I want to be the city mouse.

35:07.107 --> 35:08.274
What?

35:08.275 --> 35:10.943
Being the country mouse is better!

35:10.944 --> 35:13.154
A peaceful life is what's best.

35:13.155 --> 35:15.281
The city has more good food.

35:15.282 --> 35:16.574
And it looks fun.

35:16.575 --> 35:20.786
Are you saying
you just want to eat and have fun?

35:20.787 --> 35:22.164
Yeah.

35:25.584 --> 35:29.128
In that case, there's a festival
going on nearby tomorrow.

35:29.129 --> 35:32.674
Do you want to go together?
I'm sure it'll be fun. And delicious.

35:34.968 --> 35:37.303
I can go if it's after work.

35:37.304 --> 35:40.849
Yay! It's a promise, okay?

35:43.393 --> 35:46.020
I'm going to the restroom.

35:52.361 --> 35:54.029
She's so damn cute.

37:02.598 --> 37:03.807
Denji?

37:08.604 --> 37:12.107
That's right. I'm Denji.

37:13.358 --> 37:17.654
I was just about to go pee myself.

37:22.075 --> 37:24.369
Let's go to the bathroom together.

37:25.204 --> 37:26.538
Okay?

37:36.590 --> 37:37.591
Pochita.

37:38.175 --> 37:40.344
I have feelings
for two different people now.

37:41.970 --> 37:43.430
Do you know who I'm talking about?

37:44.806 --> 37:46.517
<i>I'm not talking about that angel.</i>

37:47.142 --> 37:48.809
<i>He's a guy.</i>

37:55.275 --> 37:58.194
<i>The small girl has a pretty face,</i>

37:58.195 --> 38:00.530
<i>but she tried to kill me.</i>

38:02.824 --> 38:04.576
Come on!

38:05.244 --> 38:08.579
<i>Power still tries to
kill me sometimes too.</i>

38:08.580 --> 38:10.289
<i>She's a narcissist, she's selfish,</i>

38:10.290 --> 38:13.126
<i>she's a pathological liar,
and she's a bigot.</i>

38:14.837 --> 38:16.838
How come you're running away?

38:16.839 --> 38:19.716
You promised you'd go
to the bathroom with me!

38:24.805 --> 38:26.306
<i>What am I going to do?</i>

38:27.933 --> 38:30.811
<i>When I close my eyes, there's two of them!</i>

38:33.188 --> 38:34.982
<i>Pochita. Which one would you choose?</i>

38:58.755 --> 39:00.174
Hello!

39:01.300 --> 39:03.927
Are you going to pee on the roof?

39:04.428 --> 39:06.847
Who... Who are you?

39:09.975 --> 39:11.684
You're asking me,

39:11.685 --> 39:14.438
but do you have any idea who you are?

39:15.355 --> 39:17.648
I know who you are.

39:17.649 --> 39:19.735
You're a piece of cheese.

39:20.319 --> 39:23.447
You're a piece of cheese
for luring out the mouse.

39:23.947 --> 39:26.658
What are you talking about? Please stop!

39:28.118 --> 39:31.621
I'm going to skin your face,
carve out your eyes

39:31.622 --> 39:33.414
and show it all to Chainsaw!

39:33.415 --> 39:35.375
And this is what I'm going to tell him.

39:36.376 --> 39:40.589
"Your precious woman is still alive."

39:43.884 --> 39:45.468
And whenever I do that,

39:45.469 --> 39:48.888
everyone starts listening to me
for some reason.

39:48.889 --> 39:50.932
Then all that's left
for me to do is to kill him.

39:50.933 --> 39:55.062
The only piece of your body I want
is your skin and your eyeballs!

39:56.188 --> 39:59.233
I don't need to take your life!

42:25.879 --> 42:28.590
You're the one who made the storm
to trap us inside the building.

42:29.174 --> 42:30.175
Right, Typhoon?

42:31.051 --> 42:33.720
I didn't know you were here, Lady Reze.

42:34.471 --> 42:36.806
I'll turn a blind eye
to what you did today.

42:36.807 --> 42:39.392
In exchange, you'll obey me for a while.

42:39.393 --> 42:42.229
Go deal with his body.

42:59.913 --> 43:02.373
Hmm.

43:02.374 --> 43:03.792
Huh?

43:15.762 --> 43:17.431
- Boo!
- Whoa!

44:49.106 --> 44:53.025
I heard about this place
from the owner of the café I work at.

44:53.026 --> 44:55.194
He said it's the best spot
to watch fireworks.

44:55.195 --> 44:58.031
No one else ever comes here.
It's a secret spot.

44:58.991 --> 45:01.034
Huh...

45:15.048 --> 45:16.300
Hey, Denji.

45:17.009 --> 45:19.052
I've been thinking a lot these days.

45:20.053 --> 45:23.306
I think your current situation is weird.

45:23.307 --> 45:26.309
You're only 16,
but they're not letting you go to school.

45:26.310 --> 45:28.312
And they're making you kill devils.

45:28.896 --> 45:30.939
It's not something
this country should allow.

45:37.529 --> 45:40.449
Why don't you quit your job
and run away with me.

45:40.991 --> 45:43.911
I'll make you happy.

45:44.745 --> 45:46.538
I'll protect you
for the rest of your life.

45:47.915 --> 45:49.082
Please.

45:54.630 --> 45:57.341
Run away? Where?

45:58.175 --> 45:59.967
I'll ask my friend.

45:59.968 --> 46:03.429
My friend has a place
where Public Safety will never find you.

46:03.430 --> 46:05.431
It won't happen right away,

46:05.432 --> 46:07.518
but we can go to school
together there someday.

46:08.727 --> 46:10.521
Why would you do all that for me?

46:11.939 --> 46:13.607
Because...

46:14.399 --> 46:16.276
I like you, Denji.

46:26.286 --> 46:28.580
Why are you having
such a hard time deciding?

46:29.540 --> 46:31.208
Denji, do you hate me?

46:31.792 --> 46:33.085
I like you!

46:34.461 --> 46:35.462
But...

46:36.046 --> 46:39.049
I've just recently started
to feel appreciated at work.

46:39.716 --> 46:42.469
I can go farther away without supervision.

46:43.470 --> 46:47.349
I'm gradually learning how to deal with
my buddy, who has a shitty personality.

46:48.809 --> 46:52.563
And I've finally started to become friends
with my difficult senior colleague.

46:53.689 --> 46:56.149
And I've found a goal
to work towards at work.

46:56.942 --> 46:59.361
Things are starting to get fun now.

47:00.696 --> 47:04.741
Can't I keep seeing you
while I continue to work?

47:07.953 --> 47:10.497
- The fireworks are about to begin!
- This way, please!

47:13.375 --> 47:14.501
I see.

47:15.169 --> 47:16.211
I understand.

47:18.755 --> 47:19.756
Denji.

47:20.591 --> 47:24.302
There's someone else you like, right?

48:47.261 --> 48:48.428
It hurts, doesn't it?

48:48.929 --> 48:50.430
I'm sorry.

48:58.397 --> 49:01.817
Denji, I'm going to take your heart. Okay?

49:08.282 --> 49:10.324
Dash!

49:10.325 --> 49:11.827
Huh?

49:19.293 --> 49:21.961
Run away! Run away!
We're in trouble! We're in trouble!

49:21.962 --> 49:25.089
How come I didn't notice anything
from the smell?

49:25.090 --> 49:27.592
She's dangerous, Lord Chainsaw!

49:27.593 --> 49:30.512
That smell...

49:31.180 --> 49:34.892
She's the Bomb Devil!

49:38.937 --> 49:40.314
Boom.

50:06.173 --> 50:07.174
You thief.

50:35.202 --> 50:36.495
Lord Chainsaw!

50:50.634 --> 50:53.302
Are you from Division 4 too?

50:53.303 --> 50:56.223
I'll let you go if you leave Denji there
and leave right now.

51:03.981 --> 51:05.774
Oh. I see.

51:20.247 --> 51:21.748
Hmm?

51:35.512 --> 51:38.974
Damn. I wanted to go to the festival.

51:39.474 --> 51:41.642
Whoa. She's killing something.

51:41.643 --> 51:44.188
We've encountered a devil
near the festival.

51:45.147 --> 51:47.191
2034.

51:47.858 --> 51:49.610
The battle begins.

51:50.277 --> 51:52.695
Are you private Devil Hunters?

51:52.696 --> 51:54.780
Whoa. She said something.

51:54.781 --> 51:56.867
This one's really strong.

52:17.888 --> 52:19.389
They sure ran away fast!

52:20.557 --> 52:22.476
DEVIL EXTERMINATION DIVISION 2
FUCHŪ TRAINING FACILITY

52:34.446 --> 52:35.656
Match over!

52:36.281 --> 52:37.991
Thank you.

52:40.285 --> 52:42.996
Thank you for your instruction.

52:44.373 --> 52:45.707
Aki.

52:46.583 --> 52:49.335
Thanks for coming.

52:49.336 --> 52:51.420
I can't say no to you, Nomo.

52:51.421 --> 52:55.716
Whoa! Really?
Then come back to Division 2!

52:55.717 --> 52:59.345
All the stories I hear about
the Special Division sound so gory anyway.

52:59.346 --> 53:03.516
If everything goes well, I'm going
to become the sub-captain in five years.

53:03.517 --> 53:06.103
When that happens,
I'm going to invite you to join.

53:07.896 --> 53:09.356
Thank you very much.

53:12.568 --> 53:13.610
<i>Hey.</i>

53:14.236 --> 53:16.697
You haven't told him
that you'll be dead in five years?

53:17.865 --> 53:20.366
Who did you hear that from?

53:20.367 --> 53:21.869
From Power.

53:22.494 --> 53:23.954
That damn devil.

53:25.455 --> 53:26.999
Don't tell anyone.

53:28.709 --> 53:30.501
You're so lucky.

53:30.502 --> 53:32.671
I want to die soon too.

53:33.839 --> 53:36.549
As long as I'm alive, I have to work hard.

53:36.550 --> 53:38.719
If I die,
I won't have to work hard anymore.

53:40.220 --> 53:41.722
Oh, that reminds me...

53:42.306 --> 53:44.683
You have a contract
with the Future Devil, right?

53:45.184 --> 53:46.893
Why don't you try asking it?

53:46.894 --> 53:48.687
Ask it when I'm going to die.

53:49.938 --> 53:51.148
I refuse.

53:52.733 --> 53:55.526
Aki! Come downstairs! Now!

53:57.279 --> 54:00.240
He showed up at the entrance and
claimed he's from the Special Division.

54:01.241 --> 54:03.910
Is this fiend really on our side?

54:03.911 --> 54:05.412
Y-Yes.

54:05.913 --> 54:09.166
Did a devil do this to Denji?

54:10.250 --> 54:13.045
Bomb is coming... Bomb...

54:13.712 --> 54:16.297
She's one of the Gun Devil's allies!

54:18.300 --> 54:20.676
How do you know that?

54:23.013 --> 54:24.181
Answer me.

54:24.806 --> 54:27.434
I could kill you right here
if I wanted to.

54:28.519 --> 54:30.561
If I tell you, they'll kill me.

54:30.562 --> 54:32.438
I promised Makima.

54:32.439 --> 54:33.940
Makima?

54:33.941 --> 54:35.566
Ah!

54:35.567 --> 54:37.694
There she is! Bomb's here!

54:45.494 --> 54:46.870
Hey, beautiful lady!

54:47.496 --> 54:49.498
Don't come any closer!

54:49.998 --> 54:52.708
This place is a training facility
for Devil Extermination Division 2.

54:52.709 --> 54:55.546
Members of the public
are not allowed to enter.

54:57.339 --> 54:59.173
Excuse me!

55:01.260 --> 55:02.301
Reze...

55:02.302 --> 55:03.678
Reze?

55:03.679 --> 55:06.222
Please help me!

55:06.223 --> 55:08.934
I'm being attacked by a devil!

55:09.560 --> 55:10.560
Oh.

55:10.561 --> 55:13.271
She's sure smiling a lot
for someone under attack.

55:13.272 --> 55:15.231
- Nomo.
- Yeah.

55:15.232 --> 55:17.441
Take your friend with you
and stay in the back.

55:17.442 --> 55:18.693
Okay.

55:18.694 --> 55:22.613
Contact headquarters and the vice-captain.
Summon all Division 2 members.

55:22.614 --> 55:24.156
Okay!

55:24.157 --> 55:25.325
And...

55:25.993 --> 55:28.704
Have you seen that beauty
somewhere before?

55:29.288 --> 55:31.706
Now's not the right time
to try to pick up women.

55:31.707 --> 55:34.209
No, I'm being serious.

55:37.504 --> 55:40.590
It can't be true. There's no way.

55:40.591 --> 55:43.342
Thanks. I'm counting on you.

55:43.343 --> 55:44.720
You owe me one.

55:46.638 --> 55:48.223
Kato! Tanabe!

55:49.099 --> 55:51.684
I'll treat you to dinner
if you can kill that woman.

55:51.685 --> 55:54.730
Don't assume she's a human.
Handle her like you would a devil.

55:55.355 --> 55:58.065
I guess it didn't work.

55:58.066 --> 55:59.610
It's not working.

56:00.903 --> 56:02.613
In that case, I've got no choice.

56:04.740 --> 56:06.992
I'll just have to kill everyone.

56:13.332 --> 56:14.498
Blood?

56:14.499 --> 56:17.169
We've caused mold to grow
in her heart and intestines.

56:17.669 --> 56:20.254
She's throwing up blood. It's working.

56:20.255 --> 56:23.258
Even if she drinks blood and regenerates,
the mold's not going to disappear.

56:24.176 --> 56:26.261
Now we just need to buy some time.

56:29.348 --> 56:30.516
Hmm?

56:33.519 --> 56:35.062
She inflicted damage to herself!

56:37.898 --> 56:39.607
Are you able to grow mold on her brain?

56:39.608 --> 56:41.818
We can only do it if the target's alive.

56:51.411 --> 56:52.537
Boo.

57:00.420 --> 57:02.839
She's a devil! A devil is here!

57:02.840 --> 57:05.675
She went right!
Don't let her get near Aki!

57:05.676 --> 57:07.386
Nomo! Behind you!

57:09.888 --> 57:11.139
Kon!

57:15.602 --> 57:17.062
Ah--

57:28.740 --> 57:31.493
There she is! There's the devil!

57:34.955 --> 57:37.498
Masaki Ando,
requesting permission to fire!

57:37.499 --> 57:38.876
Permission granted!

57:50.345 --> 57:52.598
In Japan,
do you need permission to fire a gun?

57:53.932 --> 57:54.933
Kon!

58:00.939 --> 58:02.941
You're pretty stubborn.

58:04.026 --> 58:06.862
Now that's a real sight for sore eyes.

58:12.451 --> 58:13.660
Kon.

58:20.584 --> 58:22.502
Excuse me for a moment.

58:22.503 --> 58:24.253
Vice-captain!

58:24.254 --> 58:27.341
That was close.

58:28.550 --> 58:31.135
What's that taste?

58:31.136 --> 58:34.472
- Huh?
- I hate this taste.

58:34.473 --> 58:35.682
I'm going home now.

58:40.270 --> 58:42.814
I was supposed to go
to a singles mixer today.

58:43.315 --> 58:46.068
Take me with you next time.

58:47.986 --> 58:51.364
I'll drive. You have them
drink some of your blood.

58:51.365 --> 58:52.949
Huh?

58:52.950 --> 58:54.618
I guess I've got no choice.

58:58.205 --> 59:00.624
Aren't you going to start the car?

59:01.458 --> 59:02.876
Damn.

59:03.460 --> 59:06.379
It showed me a future
I didn't want to see.

59:06.380 --> 59:07.463
Huh?

59:18.725 --> 59:20.393
That monster.

59:20.394 --> 59:24.146
I killed them to show you
how powerful I am.

59:24.147 --> 59:26.525
I don't want to kill anyone if possible.

59:27.860 --> 59:30.862
Take Denji out of the car and leave.

59:45.961 --> 59:49.673
The gasoline is going to
make that car burn to a crisp.

59:53.844 --> 59:56.221
What a pain.

59:57.764 --> 59:59.266
Acho!

01:00:03.854 --> 01:00:05.855
I asked the Special Division for backup.

01:00:05.856 --> 01:00:07.149
They saved us.

01:00:13.739 --> 01:00:15.115
No way!

01:00:16.658 --> 01:00:19.620
I kicked with everything I got just now.

01:00:20.579 --> 01:00:22.164
Nice kick.

01:00:25.751 --> 01:00:27.002
Want to fight?

01:00:28.545 --> 01:00:31.631
Kobeni! We're changing strategies!

01:00:32.883 --> 01:00:36.093
This one's a lot stronger than us!

01:00:36.094 --> 01:00:38.388
Time for a strategic retreat!

01:00:38.972 --> 01:00:40.432
Anyways, bye.

01:00:45.687 --> 01:00:48.272
My legs... My legs...

01:00:48.273 --> 01:00:50.108
My legs gave out...

01:00:51.318 --> 01:00:54.112
My legs... My legs...

01:00:59.117 --> 01:01:02.119
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:04.957
I'll quit my job. So please forgive me!

01:01:25.519 --> 01:01:26.520
There she is!

01:01:34.152 --> 01:01:37.905
Hey. Chainsaw's awake now.

01:01:37.906 --> 01:01:40.450
But the bomb girl's right behind us.

01:01:41.994 --> 01:01:44.036
Shit! Damn!

01:01:44.037 --> 01:01:47.039
The transmitter's broken on this car.

01:01:48.375 --> 01:01:50.127
What's wrong with this car?

01:01:51.253 --> 01:01:54.046
If it comes down to it,
I'm going to crash this car into her!

01:01:54.047 --> 01:01:56.800
I can't let her have Denji!

01:01:58.635 --> 01:02:00.386
What's going on?

01:02:00.387 --> 01:02:02.430
He's cutting the top of the car!

01:02:02.431 --> 01:02:03.640
Huh?

01:02:06.602 --> 01:02:07.894
Stop, Denji!

01:02:07.895 --> 01:02:09.897
You haven't had that much blood yet!

01:02:11.106 --> 01:02:14.233
It hurt so much,
I thought I was going to die.

01:02:14.234 --> 01:02:17.320
My brain's all mixed-up.

01:02:17.321 --> 01:02:19.948
But I spent some time
looking back on what's happened.

01:02:21.283 --> 01:02:24.202
And I just realized

01:02:24.203 --> 01:02:27.789
that every single girl I ever meet
always tries to kill me!

01:02:28.373 --> 01:02:32.126
Everyone always wants Chainsaw's heart!

01:02:32.127 --> 01:02:36.297
Doesn't anyone want Denji's heart? Huh?

01:02:36.298 --> 01:02:40.051
I really do like you, Denji. It's true.

01:02:40.052 --> 01:02:42.053
Huh? Really?

01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:47.976
Don't listen to the enemy!
You're so gullible!

01:02:50.270 --> 01:02:53.815
That was close.
I was about to get tricked.

01:02:54.399 --> 01:02:57.610
I don't know why you're trying to kill me.

01:02:57.611 --> 01:02:59.821
But I don't care!

01:03:00.531 --> 01:03:02.574
I've got Makima!

01:03:03.408 --> 01:03:04.825
Makima?

01:03:04.826 --> 01:03:09.455
Denji, I didn't know that witch
has got you in the palm of her hand.

01:03:09.456 --> 01:03:12.583
Then it would have been no use
even if we ran away together.

01:03:12.584 --> 01:03:14.252
Aw.

01:03:14.253 --> 01:03:17.589
I wish I never kissed you! Aw.

01:03:20.801 --> 01:03:22.134
If anyone else dies because of me,

01:03:22.135 --> 01:03:25.055
I'm going to have trouble getting
out of bed in the morning.

01:03:26.181 --> 01:03:28.850
I'm going to arrest you!

01:03:28.851 --> 01:03:30.852
Come here, Denji.

01:03:30.853 --> 01:03:34.605
I'm going to show you how we fight.

01:03:34.606 --> 01:03:37.317
Then show me!

01:04:00.174 --> 01:04:03.301
Denji. You're not applying
what you've learned.

01:04:03.302 --> 01:04:06.137
You can't just swing
your chainsaws around.

01:04:06.138 --> 01:04:08.931
You've got to understand
your own power better.

01:04:08.932 --> 01:04:10.058
Huh?

01:04:13.687 --> 01:04:14.730
Boom.

01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:09.993
Regeneration?

01:05:11.036 --> 01:05:12.620
So you were revving the engine

01:05:12.621 --> 01:05:14.915
before you got kicked.

01:05:49.241 --> 01:05:50.576
You Devil!

01:06:10.721 --> 01:06:12.973
<i>If I mess up even
a single move, I'm going to die.</i>

01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:17.102
<i>I can see the future,
but only a few seconds in advance.</i>

01:06:17.686 --> 01:06:20.063
<i>I don't know if my body
will be able to react in time.</i>

01:06:26.028 --> 01:06:27.654
<i>Perfect judgment.</i>

01:06:32.951 --> 01:06:34.161
<i>Perfect judgment.</i>

01:06:36.205 --> 01:06:37.998
<i>Perfect judgment.</i>

01:06:43.795 --> 01:06:45.214
<i>Perfect--</i>

01:06:52.679 --> 01:06:53.888
That was close!

01:06:53.889 --> 01:06:56.892
Sorry I'm late.

01:06:57.476 --> 01:07:00.061
This is the first time I've ever
wanted to be friends with a Devil!

01:07:00.062 --> 01:07:01.396
Here you go.

01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:07.068
Time-out!

01:07:07.069 --> 01:07:09.904
I'm anemic
and I'm almost naked over here.

01:07:09.905 --> 01:07:12.156
And you've got the two of you.
That's not fair.

01:07:12.157 --> 01:07:15.660
You're right. Should we give her a break?

01:07:15.661 --> 01:07:17.036
No.

01:07:17.037 --> 01:07:19.163
That's what he said. Sorry!

01:07:19.164 --> 01:07:20.374
The time-out is over.

01:07:26.588 --> 01:07:30.801
Lady Reze! Typhoon is here!

01:07:31.969 --> 01:07:33.887
That's not fair!

01:07:52.906 --> 01:07:53.991
It's okay.

01:07:54.825 --> 01:07:56.743
You're going to go to heaven.

01:08:01.999 --> 01:08:03.791
I'm going to take your blood.

01:08:03.792 --> 01:08:05.043
Sorry.

01:08:26.231 --> 01:08:29.066
A normal devil would have been dead.

01:08:29.067 --> 01:08:32.196
You're so impressive, Lord Chainsaw!
You're amazing!

01:08:33.113 --> 01:08:36.072
Your girlfriend has killed
too many people.

01:08:36.073 --> 01:08:39.453
If we let her run free,
then many more will die.

01:08:40.412 --> 01:08:43.080
Chainsaw. Make your choice.

01:08:43.081 --> 01:08:47.084
<i>Either let her kill you
and minimize the damage,</i>

01:08:47.085 --> 01:08:48.921
<i>or kill her instead.</i>

01:08:51.048 --> 01:08:54.301
Well, that's an easy decision.

01:08:55.426 --> 01:08:57.888
Reze is incredibly powerful, though.

01:08:59.973 --> 01:09:03.393
Shark, you know
about the Chainsaw Devil, right?

01:09:03.977 --> 01:09:07.481
If you don't want to die today,
then you should tell us what you know.

01:09:09.483 --> 01:09:12.652
Lord Chainsaw runs really fast!

01:09:12.653 --> 01:09:17.490
But when he goes places,
he doesn't just use his legs.

01:09:17.491 --> 01:09:20.201
He uses the chains on his chainsaws
to get around.

01:09:20.202 --> 01:09:22.077
He flings his chains through the air
and hooks them on buildings,

01:09:22.078 --> 01:09:24.121
and then he swings
from building to building!

01:09:24.122 --> 01:09:28.416
I see! Samurai Sword
draws his sword to get around.

01:09:28.417 --> 01:09:31.170
And Reze uses explosions.

01:09:31.171 --> 01:09:33.548
I need to apply my own powers too!

01:09:33.549 --> 01:09:36.843
Lord Chainsaw, you're a genius!
Lord Chainsaw, you're a genius!

01:09:36.844 --> 01:09:41.598
I should use chains to get around!
I see! I get it!

01:09:43.308 --> 01:09:46.102
That's right! That's right!

01:09:46.103 --> 01:09:47.978
I'm going to try it!

01:09:47.979 --> 01:09:50.899
- Beam! Turn into a shark!
- Okay!

01:09:53.359 --> 01:09:54.361
Huh?

01:09:55.445 --> 01:09:57.906
This is it!

01:09:59.199 --> 01:10:04.538
I'm going to use chains to control Beam,
and Beam is going to run like a horse!

01:10:06.164 --> 01:10:08.791
That's not it...
That's not it...

01:10:08.792 --> 01:10:11.377
Are you sure? I don't think that's it.

01:10:11.378 --> 01:10:14.338
I think you're supposed to shoot out
the chains from your arms

01:10:14.339 --> 01:10:16.007
and hook them onto buildings.

01:10:16.008 --> 01:10:19.760
Huh? This is the right way! Right, Beam?

01:10:19.761 --> 01:10:22.013
You're right! You're right! You're right!

01:10:22.014 --> 01:10:24.432
All right! Run, Beam!

01:10:24.433 --> 01:10:29.021
You're right! You're right!

01:10:36.653 --> 01:10:39.406
What are you doing?

01:10:40.282 --> 01:10:41.533
Denji!

01:10:42.159 --> 01:10:44.619
There you are, Chainsaw!

01:10:44.620 --> 01:10:48.248
Denji! I'm going to make you
regret coming back to life!

01:10:49.583 --> 01:10:53.794
Beam! Don't make me regret this!

01:10:53.795 --> 01:10:55.088
Okay!

01:10:57.299 --> 01:10:59.218
Damn! Those guys...

01:10:59.801 --> 01:11:01.219
It's a monster battle!

01:11:01.220 --> 01:11:04.097
We're just going to
have to sit it out and watch.

01:11:17.069 --> 01:11:20.071
You keep missing!

01:11:20.072 --> 01:11:21.864
You're like a cockroach.

01:11:21.865 --> 01:11:25.076
I'm tired of the explosions!

01:11:25.077 --> 01:11:27.371
Chainsaw!

01:11:38.090 --> 01:11:40.175
- Take that!
- Ouch!

01:11:42.219 --> 01:11:44.512
What a waste.

01:11:44.513 --> 01:11:47.181
I cut off a beautiful woman's leg.

01:11:47.182 --> 01:11:50.477
Lady Reze! Take my blood!

01:11:55.983 --> 01:11:57.900
Oh! Good!

01:11:57.901 --> 01:11:59.361
Wait, that's not good!

01:11:59.862 --> 01:12:02.906
This is crazy.

01:12:04.616 --> 01:12:05.617
Oh!

01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:15.043
Grab on to something!

01:12:15.794 --> 01:12:18.172
I can't! I can't!

01:12:27.389 --> 01:12:28.390
It's okay.

01:12:29.975 --> 01:12:32.894
It's okay! You can let go!

01:12:32.895 --> 01:12:36.899
If I'm going to die, I don't care!
It just means today was my day to die.

01:12:37.482 --> 01:12:38.901
I'll be fine.

01:12:39.610 --> 01:12:42.153
I've been ready to die for a long time.

01:13:09.389 --> 01:13:11.432
Why?

01:13:11.433 --> 01:13:13.392
Why did you touch my hand?

01:13:13.393 --> 01:13:16.230
- Do you want to die?
- Of course I don't want to die!

01:13:20.776 --> 01:13:23.695
How much did my lifespan
decrease just now?

01:13:27.282 --> 01:13:28.408
About two months.

01:13:35.707 --> 01:13:38.961
If you want to die,
then die somewhere far away from me.

01:13:40.003 --> 01:13:42.047
I can't take it anymore,
watching someone die

01:13:42.756 --> 01:13:44.383
right in front of me.

01:14:05.445 --> 01:14:07.906
Lord Chainsaw!
We're in trouble! Something's coming!

01:14:08.574 --> 01:14:10.492
Lord Chainsaw--

01:14:15.289 --> 01:14:17.124
Hmm? Huh?

01:14:39.897 --> 01:14:42.774
Lord Chainsaw!

01:15:46.255 --> 01:15:47.756
Whoa.

01:15:56.014 --> 01:15:57.933
You were hanging in there
for a pretty long time.

01:15:59.601 --> 01:16:00.811
But I think it's time now...

01:16:03.438 --> 01:16:04.940
to put an end to this.

01:16:16.243 --> 01:16:18.203
That was close!

01:16:19.371 --> 01:16:20.496
Beam!

01:16:20.497 --> 01:16:24.001
Lord Chainsaw!
I'll make sure you won't regret this!

01:16:34.553 --> 01:16:36.262
Hey! This is bad!

01:16:36.263 --> 01:16:38.723
He's going to turn the whole city
into mincemeat at this rate!

01:16:38.724 --> 01:16:42.560
Beam! We've got to get
that fat-ass to shut up first!

01:16:42.561 --> 01:16:43.729
Okay!

01:16:55.032 --> 01:16:57.034
I found you!

01:17:02.956 --> 01:17:06.543
Die! Chainsaw!

01:17:35.614 --> 01:17:36.782
Yeah!

01:17:37.491 --> 01:17:39.992
Beam! Send me flying!

01:17:39.993 --> 01:17:41.995
Yeah!

01:17:49.503 --> 01:17:52.296
This makes it easy for me!

01:17:52.297 --> 01:17:55.676
All I have to do
is swing my chainsaws around...

01:17:56.260 --> 01:17:59.388
like crazy!

01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:04.768
Whoa!

01:18:06.019 --> 01:18:08.312
Beam!

01:18:08.313 --> 01:18:11.149
Lord Chainsaw!

01:18:29.501 --> 01:18:31.919
Stay away!

01:18:35.632 --> 01:18:37.550
Come on!

01:19:12.669 --> 01:19:14.587
We did it! Beam!

01:19:14.588 --> 01:19:16.215
Where's Reze?

01:19:17.674 --> 01:19:19.343
Ah! Lord Chainsaw!

01:20:17.943 --> 01:20:19.278
Whoa!

01:21:06.033 --> 01:21:07.491
Ouch!

01:21:07.492 --> 01:21:09.118
You saved me, Beam!

01:21:12.247 --> 01:21:15.918
Denji. Don't you think
it's about time you gave up?

01:21:16.543 --> 01:21:17.878
Uh...

01:21:18.670 --> 01:21:19.671
No.

01:21:40.275 --> 01:21:44.196
You're being a huge pain in the ass.
Just hurry up and die already.

01:21:44.821 --> 01:21:50.077
Then you should have just
killed me when we first met!

01:21:52.204 --> 01:21:53.705
There's nowhere left to run.

01:21:54.456 --> 01:21:55.707
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

01:21:56.333 --> 01:21:59.919
You shouldn't have taught me how to swim.

01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:02.673
Huh... You're going to swim?

01:22:32.035 --> 01:22:33.453
Chains?

01:22:52.806 --> 01:22:56.935
Can you still explode when you're wet?

01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:46.420
I can't believe it.

01:24:47.462 --> 01:24:49.882
Why did you resurrect me?

01:24:52.259 --> 01:24:55.012
I have a great life.

01:24:55.679 --> 01:24:59.682
No matter how many times
I get beat up or die,

01:24:59.683 --> 01:25:03.353
as long as I get to eat good food
the next day, I can forgive.

01:25:04.730 --> 01:25:05.731
But...

01:25:07.191 --> 01:25:10.152
if I capture you and hand you over
to Public Safety,

01:25:10.736 --> 01:25:14.656
I'd feel like I had a fish bone
stuck in my throat.

01:25:18.827 --> 01:25:21.454
Even if I were living
a good life every day,

01:25:21.455 --> 01:25:24.833
it would feel bad, having something
poking the back of my throat.

01:25:30.255 --> 01:25:33.758
Do you think you would
still say that if I killed you right now?

01:25:35.636 --> 01:25:37.637
If someone's going to kill me,

01:25:37.638 --> 01:25:39.264
then I'd rather be killed
by a beautiful woman.

01:25:50.359 --> 01:25:51.568
Ah...

01:25:53.153 --> 01:25:58.242
Do you really still believe
that I like you for real?

01:25:59.368 --> 01:26:03.747
The look on my face when I met you,
and the way I blushed... It was all a lie.

01:26:04.665 --> 01:26:06.666
I just trained myself how to do it.

01:26:08.043 --> 01:26:10.212
I failed.

01:26:10.754 --> 01:26:13.507
I took too much time before I fought you.

01:26:15.133 --> 01:26:17.469
I'm going to run away now.

01:26:24.226 --> 01:26:25.811
Do you want to run away together?

01:26:27.271 --> 01:26:28.355
Huh?

01:26:29.147 --> 01:26:32.192
I can fight too.
You'll have a better chance at escaping.

01:26:34.236 --> 01:26:36.988
I killed lots of people.

01:26:36.989 --> 01:26:41.952
If you let me get away,
that would make you complicit in murder.

01:26:42.452 --> 01:26:43.996
Do you understand what that means?

01:26:45.205 --> 01:26:46.206
Uh...

01:26:46.790 --> 01:26:49.126
I know I shouldn't,
but I've got no choice.

01:26:49.626 --> 01:26:51.170
I still like you.

01:26:52.296 --> 01:26:54.130
You said it was all a lie.

01:26:54.131 --> 01:26:57.217
But you did teach me how to swim. Right?

01:27:39.426 --> 01:27:40.635
Hey!

01:27:40.636 --> 01:27:43.596
You should learn to be smarter.

01:27:43.597 --> 01:27:46.266
Reze! Hey, Reze!

01:27:51.855 --> 01:27:56.359
I'm going to be waiting
at the café at lunch!

01:27:56.360 --> 01:27:58.070
You'd better--

01:28:02.199 --> 01:28:05.118
Get up, Beam! My hand won't move!

01:28:06.286 --> 01:28:08.038
Rev up my engine!

01:28:52.583 --> 01:28:55.960
<i>There's a fairy tale
that mothers in the Soviet Union tell</i>

01:28:55.961 --> 01:28:57.045
<i>when scolding their children.</i>

01:28:58.172 --> 01:29:04.552
<i>The story says that there's a secret room
in the military's munitions storehouse.</i>

01:29:04.553 --> 01:29:06.555
And the secret room is filled
with orphans.

01:29:09.766 --> 01:29:12.268
The kids who live there
don't have any freedom.

01:29:12.269 --> 01:29:13.896
They're not allowed to go outside.

01:29:14.897 --> 01:29:16.439
They're treated like objects.

01:29:16.440 --> 01:29:19.443
And the military uses their bodies
for experiments until they die.

01:29:20.027 --> 01:29:22.571
It was supposed to be just a fairy tale.

01:29:23.071 --> 01:29:27.284
But one day, a newspaper reported that
that secret room really did exist.

01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:30.203
<i>An American journalist was the one
who uncovered the story.</i>

01:29:30.204 --> 01:29:32.164
<i>It was all over the news.</i>

01:29:32.664 --> 01:29:36.126
<i>They published photos
of the children who were there.</i>

01:29:36.627 --> 01:29:38.420
<i>But the story soon disappeared.</i>

01:29:39.004 --> 01:29:42.173
<i>The girl who lured Denji in
was one of the kids from that room.</i>

01:29:42.174 --> 01:29:43.299
TYPHOON DEVIL DAMAGE RELIEF FUND

01:29:43.300 --> 01:29:44.843
YOUR SUPPORT AND COOPERATION
ARE APPRECIATED

01:29:45.928 --> 01:29:49.598
A fighter created by the Soviet Union
to serve their country.

01:29:53.435 --> 01:29:56.939
<i>They're called guinea pigs.</i>

01:29:59.900 --> 01:30:04.321
<i>The Yamabiko train bound for
Sendai will soon depart from Platform 12.</i>

01:30:05.113 --> 01:30:07.114
<i>The next stop will be Ueno.</i>

01:30:07.115 --> 01:30:08.491
<i>The train will now depart.</i>

01:30:08.492 --> 01:30:10.743
<i>This is the Yamabiko train
bound for Sendai.</i>

01:30:10.744 --> 01:30:13.371
<i>The train will now depart.
Doors are closing.</i>

01:30:13.372 --> 01:30:15.457
<i>Please stand clear of the closing doors.</i>

01:31:28.155 --> 01:31:29.156
Me too.

01:31:31.867 --> 01:31:34.369
I like the country mouse too.

01:31:36.914 --> 01:31:40.292
One of my friends has a field
in the countryside.

01:31:41.168 --> 01:31:45.005
I go there to help out my friend
every year in the fall.

01:31:46.298 --> 01:31:51.011
The field has mice hiding in the soil
that damage the crops.

01:31:51.929 --> 01:31:56.058
We have to exterminate the mice
before the fields get covered in snow.

01:31:56.642 --> 01:32:02.105
So we dig up the fields and have the dogs
kill the mice hiding inside.

01:32:03.315 --> 01:32:04.525
I wonder why...

01:32:05.359 --> 01:32:06.944
whenever I watch...

01:32:08.362 --> 01:32:09.863
I feel so comforted.

01:32:15.327 --> 01:32:17.454
That's why I like the country mouse.

01:32:53.240 --> 01:32:54.324
<i>Why...</i>

01:32:55.367 --> 01:32:58.829
<i>I wonder why I didn't kill you
the first time we met.</i>

01:33:00.163 --> 01:33:03.208
<i>Denji, to be honest...</i>

01:33:04.960 --> 01:33:08.046
<i>I've never been to school either.</i>

01:33:21.185 --> 01:33:24.271
I told you to come with Hayakawa.

01:33:24.771 --> 01:33:28.358
You didn't want to make
Hayakawa kill a girl.

01:33:29.318 --> 01:33:30.527
You're so kind.

01:33:31.528 --> 01:33:33.906
It's because I'm an angel.

01:33:45.125 --> 01:33:46.126
Hey.

01:33:47.044 --> 01:33:48.712
Is the city a good place?

01:37:56.376 --> 01:37:59.421
Denji. I've got to close the café now.

01:38:01.006 --> 01:38:02.841
That girl was too cute.

01:38:03.509 --> 01:38:05.385
She was from a different world.

01:38:07.179 --> 01:38:10.974
I'm sure you'll meet a girl
who's perfect for you someday.

01:38:22.027 --> 01:38:23.695
RECOMMENDATIONS

01:38:37.543 --> 01:38:40.211
P-P-P-Power!

01:38:41.713 --> 01:38:47.134
I'm back! I tracked you down
by following your scent.

01:38:47.135 --> 01:38:49.721
What a tiny café!

01:38:56.895 --> 01:38:58.396
Hmm?

01:38:58.397 --> 01:39:01.107
Oh. What are you doing with those flowers?

01:39:01.108 --> 01:39:04.695
They would really suit me!
Give them to me!

01:39:19.209 --> 01:39:23.546
Hey! Don't eat them!
They're mine! You thief!

01:39:23.547 --> 01:39:25.590
You idiot!

01:39:25.591 --> 01:39:27.384
Spit them out right now!

01:39:27.885 --> 01:39:31.721
Spit them out! Spit them out!
