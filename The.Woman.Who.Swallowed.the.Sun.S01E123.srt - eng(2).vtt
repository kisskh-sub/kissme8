WEBVTT

00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:03.380
So if the board of directors opposes it,
it's impossible, right?

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:06.380
By law, the authority to call
a shareholders' meeting...

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.110
is held by the chairman of the board,
the CEO,

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:11.950
or a board resolution.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.050
I got worked up over nothing.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.420
See? Things have a way of working out.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.790
I was worried that woman
would use Father's stake...

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.560
to call a shareholders' meeting
and take the chairman's seat.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.160
Still, we can't be too careful.
We have to be absolutely sure.

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.630
Okay, so that's
for the regular shareholders' meeting,

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.000
but can't she call a special meeting
as the largest shareholder?

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.540
A shareholder who's held
over a three percent stake...

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.370
for more than six months...

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.380
can convene a special meeting
with the court's permission.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.710
Wait, what? So if she gets
the court's approval, it's a done deal?

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.050
Were you even listening?

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.250
I said she has to
have held the stake for over six months.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.850
She hasn't held the stake
for nearly long enough,

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.690
so there's no way the court
will grant her permission.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.560
So at the end of the day,
it all comes down to the board?

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.930
That's right. As things stand now.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.770
Then what do we do?
We have no way to sway the board.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.340
They will do whatever it takes
to keep the directors on a tight leash.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.240
This time, they'll likely
go beyond simple threats.

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.210
With stakes this high,
they'll do whatever it takes...

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.850
to scare the directors out of defecting.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.590
Actually, that could be our opportunity.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.160
So, you're saying we should be the ones
to really scare the directors this time?

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:28.560
Don't you remember...

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.630
what those idiots did last time?

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:32.760
(Mingang Distribution)

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.130
Madam Jang dug up dirt on the directors
to find their weaknesses,

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.440
and then blackmailed them
into siding with her.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.170
That is what happened.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.880
Then I suppose Madam Jang
could blackmail the directors again.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.910
Exactly. So we need to hit them
with something stronger.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.680
If we scare them more than the other side,
they'll have to listen to us.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.620
"Something stronger?"

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:57.420
My guess is...

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.790
Min Kyung Chae will use
a devastating weakness...

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.530
to pressure the board.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.330
But those directors are no pushovers.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.730
To blackmail people like that
into doing what she wants,

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.770
just what kind of devastating weakness
must she have on them?

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.940
What weakness could be so big?

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:18.810
It's Se Ri.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.950
Hey, Se Ri. It's Mom.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.120
You had me so worried, leaving like that.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.520
You're okay, right?

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.790
How are you feeling?

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.360
I called because I have a question.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.790
And I need you to be honest with me.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.660
Okay. What is it you want to know?

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:42.870
Mom, did you ever...

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.640
have a daughter?

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.070
I mean, besides me,

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.550
was there ever another child
who called you Mom?

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:56.950
Yes,

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.420
there was.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.190
I was never officially married,

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.960
but I did have a daughter...

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.060
when I was young.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:09.860
By any chance,

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.360
was her name Mi So?

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:16.940
Yes, that's right.

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:20.640
My daughter's name...

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.710
was Mi So.

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:28.810
Was she...

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.190
the one who committed suicide
at our company four years ago?

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.430
Yes.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.330
That was her.

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.280
The person you called is unavailable.
Connecting to voicemail.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:03.510
What do I do?

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.320
Se Ri knows...

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.390
that I'm Mi So's mom.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.190
What? How?

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.260
Who told her?

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.960
It had to be CEO Min.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.340
So that's how she finally
got her hooks into Se Ri.

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:27.010
How much do you think she knows?

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.870
Does she seem like she doesn't know
that she was switched...

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.080
and that you're her birth mother?

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.880
I don't think she knows about that part.

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.080
Min Kyung Chae wouldn't have dared
to tell her that part.

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.550
The poor girl must be in such shock.

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.090
What do we do?

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.570
("Abuse of Power by the Rich?")

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.100
("Abuse of Power by the Rich?")

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.810
("In Reality, It Was a Scam
to Get Beaten for Money")

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.410
No, that's not true.

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.840
She said the girl looked rich...

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.910
and said she'd get beaten up
to blackmail her for money.

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.550
Something similar happened
when she worked for me.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.220
She wanted the money.

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:14.820
Her family is poor...

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.150
and she always needed money.

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.130
That's a relief. Now that
your youngest sister-in-law is back home,

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:25.400
that's one less thing to worry about.

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.870
My dear wife,
our worries are just getting started...

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.500
with our in-law's wife running around
after stealing his stake.

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:31.940
An in-law's wife, my foot.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.470
How can you call her that
when she backstabbed Chairman Min?

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.380
Anyway, if that woman
gets any funny ideas,

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.840
our in-law's company
could be completely wiped out.

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.950
That's not the case, Father.

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:44.880
Apparently, she doesn't have the authority
to call a shareholders' meeting.

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.020
She'd have to go through
the board of directors,

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:50.420
and the board is on our side.

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:52.960
Oh, my, that's wonderful!

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.460
It must be because of the good luck charm.
Gosh, it really works.

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:57.560
Right, Ja Kyung?

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.460
A good luck charm?

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.370
Yes, sure.

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:02.870
Oh, right. Dad.

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:05.600
You need to give us
the company stake you have.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.640
We need to gather every share we can
to stop that woman.

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:16.650
What? All of it? Right here, right now?

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:18.820
Yes, that's why we're here.

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.650
That's right. What are you waiting for?

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:23.550
You didn't sell off the stake, did you?

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:25.790
I didn't sell it!

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:27.190
Gosh, you scared me.

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:30.930
After the safe was robbed,
I buried them in a very safe place.

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:33.930
If you say I sold it one more time,
I'll bury you next. Got it?

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:42.670
What took you so long?

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:44.440
What is it?

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.580
Did something else happen?

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.710
It's just that ever since Se Ri got home,

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:52.950
she's been holed up in her room
and hasn't come out at all.

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:54.950
Really?

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.500
Why are you acting like this?

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:07.930
I heard you haven't left your room
all day.

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:10.230
Why?

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:12.440
Did you commit a crime or something?

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.740
I did.

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:16.970
I did do something wrong.

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.480
What happened to that girl, Mi So,
was my fault.

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:23.880
It was all my fault.

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:28.720
Listen to me carefully.

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:31.390
Everyone has their faults.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.360
It's just a matter of degree.
No one lives a perfectly blameless life.

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:38.600
But when two people commit the same crime,
one gets punished,

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:39.760
and the other gets away with it.

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:42.570
And why do you think that is?

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.340
It's whether you admit to it or not.

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:49.340
That's the only difference.

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:52.010
Look.

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:54.410
You didn't do a single thing wrong.

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:57.650
And even if you did,
from this moment on, you didn't.

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:00.820
You have to deny it to the end.
Say you don't know anything,

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:02.990
that it wasn't you,
and that it never happened.

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.020
But I did do something wrong.
How can I just lie?

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.660
You just deny it to the bitter end,
and it goes away.

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:12.260
Do you understand what I'm saying?

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:24.140
How could you say something
like that to her?

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:28.110
She's been through a traumatic experience,
and she's terrified.

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:30.380
Did you really have to bring up Mi So,
of all things?

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.550
You think Mi So is just my daughter?

00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:35.820
She has nothing to do with you?

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:38.490
How many times do I have to tell you?
She doesn't.

00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:42.990
If you're so sure of yourself,
why don't you tell her about the switch?

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:45.960
And why would I do that?

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:48.400
It's not like it would change anything.

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:51.040
What if Se Ri blames herself
for what happened to Mi So...

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:56.040
and decides to do something drastic?

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.940
That's not going to happen,
so don't worry.

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:01.410
I've told Se Ri it wasn't her fault.

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:03.010
What did you say?

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:05.850
How could a mother say something
like that?

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:09.420
You're supposed to teach her
right and wrong and discipline her!

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:13.520
And you still call yourself a mother?
You don't deserve to be one.

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:17.600
Se Ri and Mi So aren't your daughters now.
They're both mine!

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:21.570
If, by some chance,
anything happens to Se Ri,

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:24.170
I will make you pay.

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:27.710
(Mingang Distribution)

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:51.960
(Mingang Distribution)

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:02.610
(Mingang Distribution)

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:16.650
(My darling Madam Baek)

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:22.130
It's not fair.

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:25.160
I'm so angry, and it's driving me crazy!

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.540
Why should I suffer like this
when I did nothing wrong?

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:37.880
You said people who did wrong
would be punished.

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:41.650
That's how the world works.
That's what you told me.

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:44.120
You said everyone paid for doing wrong.

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:45.950
So why...

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:49.920
Why won't they be punished?

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:53.560
Are the rich allowed to get away with it?

00:10:58.800 --> 00:10:59.800
Mom.

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:04.970
I'm sorry, Mom.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.270
No.

00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:56.090
(Mingang Distribution)

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:58.920
I came here to ask you something.
Please just answer me honestly.

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:02.430
That girl who committed suicide
on our company's rooftop, Mi So.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:04.900
You said her mother
is our stepmother, right?

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:08.500
And that she came to our house
to get revenge for her daughter's death.

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:11.440
That's right. It's true.

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:14.170
So you knew all that and just did nothing?

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:17.340
- What are you talking about?
- You didn't apologize to our stepmother?

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:20.440
You should've at least said you were wrong
and begged for her forgiveness.

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:23.380
Any decent person would have begged
for forgiveness!

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:25.280
What did I tell you yesterday?

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:28.890
I told you that it only becomes a crime
the moment you admit you're guilty.

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:31.360
I told you to deny everything
to the end, didn't I?

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:32.760
Kyung Chae!

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:36.660
All you have to do is deny everything.
Then no one can point their finger at you.

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:39.130
Why would you be stupid enough
to just admit it?

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:43.370
It was her fate to die like that.

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:47.640
Because she was weak-willed
and soft-hearted.

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:49.810
Did anyone push her?

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:52.210
It was her own choice.

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:55.150
That woman is just twisting it
to make it our fault.

00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:58.520
It's not your fault,
and it's not my fault.

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:01.620
If you can't do it, then I will.

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:04.050
I will apologize to Mi So myself.

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:05.560
What are you talking about?

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:08.890
Se Ri!

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:10.790
Se Ri!

00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:30.110
No, it can't be.

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:34.080
I'm sorry.

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:37.050
I'm so sorry, Mi So.

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:40.720
You were innocent,
but you died because of me.

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:47.500
I should have admitted I was wrong
and apologized right away.

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:52.500
I was a coward.

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:55.770
What I did was awful.

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:00.580
I'm sorry.

00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:04.380
I'm truly sorry.

00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:16.060
No!

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:28.140
I'm sorry.

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:32.110
Your daughter died because of me.

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:34.680
This is my apology.

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:37.250
Please accept this as my apology.

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:38.980
No, Se Ri.

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:41.620
No! Don't do it!

00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:44.490
This is what you wanted, isn't it?

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:47.790
You wanted me dead
just like your daughter.

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:51.800
You became my stepmother
to take revenge on me!

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:54.230
So I'll just die.

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:57.330
I'll die just like your daughter did!

00:14:58.200 --> 00:14:59.200
You are...

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:03.870
my real daughter!

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:15.390
You and Mi So were switched at birth.

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:17.220
So please don't do this.

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:19.090
Se Ri, please.

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:22.160
Please come down. I'm begging you.

00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:25.230
You're saying I'm your real daughter?

00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:34.670
I carried you for ten months.

00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:39.110
I nearly died giving birth to you.
The sky knows, and the earth knows.

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:42.950
And nothing in this world
can ever change that.

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:46.950
And you expect me to believe you now?

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:49.090
Because of someone's mistake...

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:50.090
No.

00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:52.120
Because of their twisted greed,

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:55.260
the two of you were switched back then.

00:15:58.030 --> 00:15:59.530
And that's how you both...

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:01.700
ended up with the wrong mothers,

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:05.070
living lives that were meant
for someone else.

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:08.510
Se Ri.

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:12.880
What happened to our Mi So...

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:16.450
Of course, I'm still heartbroken over it.

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:18.320
But if I were to lose you too...

00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:20.420
because of that,

00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:23.450
then I'll have no reason to live.

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:27.390
What mother could possibly go on
after losing two daughters?

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:30.660
So please...

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:33.460
Please just come down. Okay?

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:35.630
Even Mi So in the skies...

00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:38.470
wouldn't want you to do this.

00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:42.070
So please come down.

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:44.240
Okay?

00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:47.010
Please.

00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:49.910
Come on.

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:55.190
Come down, Se Ri.

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:57.720
Come on.

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:01.530
Se Ri.

00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:04.930
Come on. Come to Mom.

00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:13.600
Come on. That's it.

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:16.440
Come on.

00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:31.860
Thank you so much for choosing to live.

00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:45.070
(Mingang Distribution)

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:14.130
Will you be okay to go home?

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:17.800
Or do you want to rest for a bit first?

00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:22.940
Just because...

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:27.540
I'm your birth mother,
it doesn't mean anything has to change.

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:31.550
Do you understand what I'm saying?

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:36.490
Kyung Chae...

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:39.220
No.

00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:43.460
You mean you're no different
from the mom who raised me.

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:46.730
That's right.

00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:51.400
By some twist of fate,

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:55.410
we both ended up raising
the other's child,

00:18:56.410 --> 00:18:57.980
but we cherished them as our own...

00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:01.310
and raised them with all our love.
That's the truth.

00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:08.850
About Mi So...

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:12.690
I'm so sorry for what I did to her.

00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:17.690
You must have been so devastated.

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:20.660
You must have been in so much pain.

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:23.330
All because of me.

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:25.770
It's all my fault.

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:49.230
What are you doing here?

00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:51.160
What do you think you're doing?

00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:53.460
Why are you in this woman's arms?

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:56.400
Stop it, Kyung Chae!

00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:59.140
She's my mother who gave birth to me.

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:00.540
She is not your mother.

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:04.410
I'm your mother!
I'm the one who gave birth to you!

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:08.150
Don't say that, please.

00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:10.510
Then what about Mi So?

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:13.350
Why are you still being so cruel to Mi So?

00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:15.420
Don't you feel sorry for her at all?

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.150
She must be heartbroken.

00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:19.660
Her own mother
won't even treat her like a daughter.

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:22.430
Please stop this, Kyung Chae.

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:25.430
I feel so sorry for Mi So.

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:28.170
No.

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:31.130
I don't feel sorry for her one bit.

00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:34.340
Because she's not my daughter.

00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:37.370
She means nothing to me.

00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:39.410
I don't know anyone named Mi So!

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:41.450
She's a stranger to me!

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:49.650
I should go after her.

00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:52.490
At this rate,
she might do something drastic.

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:55.160
I'm so confused myself right now,

00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:58.500
and if something happens to her too,
I don't think I could bear it.

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:01.970
Okay, go on. Hurry.

00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:03.770
Go and try to calm her down.

00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:22.850
(Mingang Distribution)

00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:40.370
What do I do?

00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:42.740
(Mingang Distribution)

00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:43.870
What am I going to do?

00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:46.780
What do I...

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:50.410
My daughter...

00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:53.350
My daughter...

00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:56.420
No.

00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:58.590
No!

00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:00.760
I...

00:22:01.790 --> 00:22:03.390
Kyung Chae, what's the matter?

00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:05.830
What? What are you looking at?

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:08.370
Over there.

00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:10.130
Over there...

00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:13.570
It's Mi So...

00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:16.340
(Mingang Distribution)

00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:17.410
Mi So...

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:19.680
There's nothing there.

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:22.580
Snap out of it! There's nothing there.

(Mingang Distribution)

00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:36.790
Mi So!

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:41.970
My sweet daughter. Where have you been?

00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:45.870
Mommy's been waiting for you.

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:48.270
Didn't you miss Mommy?

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:51.710
What's gotten into you?

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:55.310
Mommy's been waiting so long
for you, Mi So.

00:22:57.250 --> 00:22:58.450
I missed you so much.

00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:01.690
You have no idea how much I missed you.

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:09.230
Should we go home?

00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:12.660
We can go home and talk face to face,

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:15.000
while looking each other in the eye.

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:16.400
Okay?

00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:21.570
My sweet daughter.

00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:24.070
My beautiful Mi So.

00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:52.940
Ms. Kyung Chae, what are you doing
with Ms. Se Ri at this hour?

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:55.210
Manager Gong? What do you mean, "Se Ri?"

00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:57.840
Why are you calling my Mi So "Se Ri?"

00:23:59.010 --> 00:24:00.110
This is my Mi So.

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:03.210
Pardon? What do you mean?

00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:06.620
Mi So, do you want to
go to my room with me?

00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:29.470
It's nice in Mommy's room,
isn't it, Mi So?

00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:36.680
I've been wanting to sleep beside you.

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:39.480
Singing you lullabies...

00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:41.520
and holding you close.

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:43.990
How about we start tonight?

00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:47.690
Okay, Mom.

00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:54.130
Let's do all of those things from now on.

00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:56.100
But Mi So,

00:24:57.530 --> 00:24:59.300
I can't remember anything.

00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:01.170
By any chance,

00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:03.710
did anything bad happen?

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:06.280
Nothing bad happened, did it?

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:09.450
There wasn't an accident
or anything, was there?

00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:15.290
Nothing happened at all.

00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:17.450
There was no accident.

00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:19.690
For a second,

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:22.860
I was so worried
that you'd gotten hurt because of me...

00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:26.260
or something terrible had happened
because of me.

00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:33.270
Nothing happened because of you, Mom,
so don't even think like that.

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:37.270
I'm relieved...

00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:41.110
that my little girl wasn't hurt
because of me.

00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:43.610
The thought that something bad...

00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:44.810
might have happened to you
because of me...

00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:46.380
terrified me so much.

00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:48.590
It's such a relief.

00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:51.690
To know I'm not the one
who hurt my own daughter.

00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:55.660
That's not what happened.

00:25:57.390 --> 00:25:58.800
It's not your fault, Mom.

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:02.370
But Mi So,

00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:04.230
are you crying?

00:26:08.670 --> 00:26:09.910
Crying? Of course not.

00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:14.810
From now on, let's do everything
we've ever wanted to.

00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:17.480
I'll stay right by your side from now on.

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:20.580
This is a fresh start for us.

00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:24.350
- Okay?
- Okay. I'd love that.

00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:26.520
Anything sounds wonderful.

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:51.880
Mi So...

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:54.920
Mi So...

00:26:57.650 --> 00:26:58.820
I'm so sorry.

00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:03.330
I'm so sorry.

00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:13.540
I'm so sorry!

00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:37.090
