[Episode 9]

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:50.420
No.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.660
After all, he's still my father.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.340
-Can't you just...
-Apple.

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:57.000
I don't like mealy apples.

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:21.450
I have to go.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.040
Call me when you've made up your mind.

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.829
You're quite confident, huh?

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:47.780
What makes you think

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.400
I'd eat anything you feed me?

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.829
Do you want her to keep bothering you?

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.960
I'm not afraid of that.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.940
Really?

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.780
Not even afraid of a woman
clinging to you?

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.820
What's there to be afraid of?

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.500
It depends on
which woman we're talking about.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:13.940
Wan Qing?

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.420
She's nothing to be afraid of.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:19.940
What about other women?

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:24.010
Who?

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.060
Who are you afraid of?

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:42.420
In my entire life,

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.640
I've never been afraid of anyone.

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:55.300
You sure about that?

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.420
Maybe one day you'll meet a woman

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.280
you're really, really afraid of.

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:13.980
If that day comes,

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:15.240
I'll accept my fate.

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:21.579
I specially found you

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.050
a coach who speaks Chinese.

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.580
This one.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:24.610
Coach Hua.

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:25.700
Hello, Coach.

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.860
I've been a top coach for ten years.

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.540
You can trust me.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.220
Congratulations, my lucky star,

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.950
for passing your driving test!

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.290
It's all thanks to you.

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:10.890
It's because you're naturally gifted.

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.460
Actually, I don't even know why,

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.120
but the moment I first saw you,

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:17.860
I just wanted to be close to you.

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.050
That's no mystery.

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.480
It's because you're beautiful and kind.

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.550
Stop teasing. I'm being serious.

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.340
It might be a connection
from our past lives.

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:27.020
That's it.

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:28.080
It's called...

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:29.540
"instant..."

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.260
"Instant connection!"

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:33.659
Your Chinese is really good.

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:34.860
You even know idioms.

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:50.490
Xin,

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.130
why did your grades drop so fast?

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:56.980
Did you not understand the lessons?

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:57.730
Xin,

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.110
you must study hard.

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.610
If I had studied hard back then,

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:03.310
I wouldn't be a hoodlum now.

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:04.630
Are you cut out for studying?

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:05.610
Back then, a C was already

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:08.210
-way beyond your usual performance.
-Go away.

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:09.510
I've gotten a C before.

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:14.660
You must

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:16.310
take my words to heart.

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:18.340
Okay, okay. I got it.

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:20.860
You really did?

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:23.750
Then I'll sign this for you this time.

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:35.490
Wait, Xin.

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.340
Do you understand
all the questions you got wrong now?

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:39.460
Let me tell you,

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:41.220
making mistakes isn't scary.

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:41.860
What's scary is...

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.260
I think you're the scary.

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:45.580
Are you signing it or not? If not, I will.

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:46.780
Why so many words?

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:50.490
Xin,

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:52.290
how do you write Jin in Jin Zhao?

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:53.810
-Give me a break.
-With your education level...

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:55.050
Give it to me. I'll sign it.

I just can't recall right now.

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:57.710
Let me think.

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:58.810
So rusty. Give it to me.

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:00.050
Do you even know how to sign it?
Give it to me.

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:01.220
-Who's going to sign it?
-Me.

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:01.980
I will. Give it to me.

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:03.490
-Let me.
-You know how to write it?

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:04.580
You don't know how to write it.
How can you sign it?

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.150
I'll sign it now. I remember it now.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:07.750
-Give it to me.
-I'll sign it.

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:09.660
Brandy.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:12.330
Well...

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:13.860
Brandy, don't get angry.

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:16.090
One test doesn't mean anything.

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:18.900
Right. Xin's actually been working hard.

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:22.490
Yes, she got an A before.

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:23.860
She even got an A+ once. I signed those.

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:24.930
You... shut up!

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:41.150
These last two questions aren't hard.

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:43.090
Why did you leave them blank?

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:44.190
I did it on purpose.

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:46.050
Why?

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:47.290
The teacher said the first-place student

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:49.460
needs to give a speech
as the student representative.

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:50.460
I don't want to go.

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:54.580
You're getting more and more
strong-willed as you grow up.

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:57.100
Not bad.
I've only ever written reflections,

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:58.460
never given a speech.

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:01.020
I was afraid my mom would nag.

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:03.220
I didn't expect you guys to be even worse.

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:04.620
She's talking about you.

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:07.170
I'll sign it for you this time.

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:08.460
Next time,

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:09.370
just talk to your teacher.

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:10.810
Don't pull these little tricks.

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:11.610
I see.

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:13.060
Yang, take her home.

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:14.130
Yes, Master.

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:19.750
Go now.

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:25.030
Be careful on your way.

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:29.050
Aren't you a bit too strict with Xin?

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.000
Too harsh. She's just a kid.

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:31.890
Indeed.

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:37.780

You want to buy a dog?

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:48.860
I sell cats too.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:49.330
-I'm right next to the shop.
-The connection is bad.

[Speeding Auto House]

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:52.130
I'll move somewhere else to talk.

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:52.610
Alright, alright.

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:53.460
-I'll go somewhere else.
-Okay, okay.

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:54.260
Just a moment.

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:03.100
I...

Hello, one milk tea please.

Here's your milk tea. Welcome back.

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:40.860
Thank you.

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:49.980
This looks cool.

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.100
The skills
are a bit rough compared to mine.

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:54.300
You're bragging.

00:09:57.940 --> 00:09:59.610
Has the locking collar been adjusted?

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:00.470
How do you know?

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:02.130
Is it that obvious?

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:04.370
There was a noise when you drove in.

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:05.580
It's loose.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:06.860
I just modified this car.

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:08.460
Can you check it again for me?

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:09.820
See that?

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.370
Indeed.

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:13.030
Right? And look here.

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:15.820
This engine doesn't suit this car.

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:17.890
And look,

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:20.060
the right locking collar is also broken.

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:21.460
It needs to be fixed too, okay?

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:22.340
Okay.

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:23.700

I'm meeting a friend here.

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:46.430
You picked the worst-tasting one.

This one?

Which flavor tastes better then?

This doesn't have any alcohol.

Don't worry.

No peach either.

Thanks.

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:38.580
It's strawberry flavor?

Welcome to my world.

Hey, Lin Sui.

We should go now.

Going up the mountain?
I can give you a ride.

No, thanks.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:54.370
I arranged to meet Sanlai
at the service area.

Sanlai?

00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:57.990
He's the one I invited.

00:11:58.010 --> 00:12:00.010
You could wait for him up the mountain.

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:02.210
You invited him? So you know each other?

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:04.650
Not really.

Let's go.

What does this mean?

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:52.940
It's an understanding between drivers,

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:54.100
like a secret code.

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:58.100
Aren't you going to note it in your phone?

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:00.070
It's not necessary.

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:05.170
Hold on tight.

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:14.870
Don't touch it yet.

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:17.150
The engine's really hot right now.

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:20.720
Why hasn't he come yet?

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:41.820
Lin Sui, look.

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:45.080
That cute little pickup
is heading up the mountain.

00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:51.610
Do you think that guy is faking it?

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:52.490
If not,

00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:53.860
it's even funnier.

00:13:56.730 --> 00:13:58.890
Why did you call Sanlai here?

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:01.820
That's something

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:03.120
I'm wondering too.

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:15.340
Sanlai, what took you so long?

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:17.010
I've been waiting for you for an hour.

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:18.010
What's the rush?

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:19.250
It's such a big event.

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:21.450
I had to get myself properly dressed up.

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:24.130
The outfit looks good.

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:26.340
But that red scarf...

00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:28.450
You have great taste.

00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:30.020
This is for good luck—

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:32.050
it means a victorious start.

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:34.890
Do you know

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:36.490
when you were driving earlier,

00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:37.350
that camera...

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:38.160
Well...

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:42.030
Let's get started.

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:46.250
Let's go.

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:49.730
Good luck.

00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:10.690
Brandy said

00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:12.130
this car is modified.

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:14.460
1000 HP, 2000 torque,

00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:17.550
Wankel engine.
It's faster than race cars on the track.

00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:23.460
Sorry.

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:25.110
I didn't mean to take advantage of you.

00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:26.960
I should be a good host.

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:29.460
I'll give you a 5-second head start.

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:30.180
How's that?

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:33.300
Then I'll respectfully accept your offer.

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:34.830
The guest follows the host.

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:42.650
Sanlai,

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:44.080
are you okay? Be careful.

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:46.100
I'm fine.

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:47.300
I just used a little trick

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:48.760
and gained the upper hand.

00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:49.340
Go back.

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:06.060
Let's go!

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:07.130
Let's move!

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:33.940
Looks like...

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:36.310
it won't take 5 seconds.

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:38.730
I realized

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:40.890
we need to follow the rules in games.

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:42.530
You don't need
to let me go first this time.

00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:43.590
Let's go together.

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:45.180
Give me the hat.

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:48.900
Give it to me.

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:52.980
This hat isn't mine.

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:54.710
I need to return it to its owner.

00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:56.030
I'll return it for you.

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:03.060
There's a good cupcake shop

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:05.190
at the service area down the mountain.

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:06.819
See you there.

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:11.040
If you get there within half an hour,
it's on me.

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:16.670
Today really got off to a bad start.

00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:18.500
All this dressing up was for nothing.

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:21.700
You're a typical underachiever
with lots of stationery.

00:17:22.819 --> 00:17:24.260
Alright, let's head back.

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:25.540
Going up the mountain was so difficult.

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:26.890
Going down must be much easier.

00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:27.740
You're wrong.

00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:30.360
The downhill road is the hardest to drive.

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:34.030
Why do I feel a little dizzy?

00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:37.020
I'll drive.

00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:48.300
Jiang Mu,

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:49.650
are you sure?

00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:51.510
It took me over an hour to drive up.

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:52.450
Don't worry.

00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:55.230
We'll definitely get there
within half an hour.

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:13.520
She only took 23 minutes.

00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:16.500
Hello.

00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:17.820
Hello, sir.

00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:21.410
Two of each: black tea, green tea,

00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:22.130
and lemon flavors.

00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:24.930
And two without cream.

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:27.500
Sanlai,
why are you only buying the cake bases?

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:28.630
They're for Brandy.

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:30.270
Brandy never eats

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:31.340
the cream on cake.

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:32.890
I don't even know

00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:35.090
what's left of a cupcake without cream.

00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:36.970
He's not really into sweets.

00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:39.170
You know he doesn't like sweets?

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:40.330
That habit of his

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:41.980
is a bit annoying, isn't it?

00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:45.980
By the way,

00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:48.190
why did Lin Sui take your hat earlier?

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:49.740
I have no idea.

00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:51.290
That guy is pretty weird.

00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:52.170
I already told him

00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:53.210
that the hat wasn't mine

00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:54.610
and that I needed to return it
to its owner.

00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:56.130
But Lin said,

00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:58.540
"I'll return it to him for you."

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.040
Ridiculous.

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:01.410
Does he even know whose hat it is?

00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:02.170
Whose is it?

00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:03.930
It's Brandy's.

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:07.710
Sir, your cakes are ready.

00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:10.550
Thanks. How much is it in total?

00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:12.480
Someone already paid for you.

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:13.740
Already paid?

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:14.370
Yes.

00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:24.130
Who was it?

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:26.060
Sanlai,

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:28.110
do you know how long it took us

00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:29.990
to get down the mountain just now?

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:30.970
Not sure.

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:33.500
40 or 50 minutes?

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:36.780
23 minutes.

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:38.420
23 minutes?

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:48.580
Turn on the lights
if you want to take photos with the car.

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:50.020
Hey handsome, you're cute!

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:51.170
Can we take a photo with you?

00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:53.540
Come on, come on, together.

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:55.130
Make me look cool.

00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:57.500
Three, two, one.

00:19:57.970 --> 00:19:59.210
One more, one more!

00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:00.290
Come on.

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:02.460
Thank you, handsome.

00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:03.650
Thanks!

00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:05.080
You're welcome.

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:05.860
Your car looks great too.

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:07.260
-Thank you. You have good taste!
-Bye-bye.

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:08.600
Don't forget me
next time you want to take a photo.

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:09.080
Sure.

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:09.820
Bye-bye!

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:10.930
Sanlai,

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:12.860
looks like you're quite popular.

00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:13.970
So why do you make yourself

00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:14.750
look like this?

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:16.540
Why don't you spruce yourself up a bit?

00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:17.610
Look like what?

00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:19.740
I put a lot of effort into this look.

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:20.970
Yes, I can see that.

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:23.450
It's just that your hair

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:25.320
is kind of covering your eyes.

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:33.060
Well,

00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:36.040
it's mainly because I'm just too charming.

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:37.860
I'm afraid the girls
will be so distracted when they see me

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:38.340
that they won't be able to move,

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:40.060
and it'll affect my pet shop business.

00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:40.740
That's why

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:43.060
I make my handsomeness

00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:44.780
look a bit mysterious.

00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:48.000
You really put a lot of thought into that.

00:20:48.050 --> 00:20:48.730
Of course.

00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:51.410
I mean it.

00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:53.110
If you trim your beard

00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:54.820
and cut your hair a bit shorter,

00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:56.860
you may look much fresher.

00:20:59.060 --> 00:20:59.990
Are you serious?

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:01.060
Yes.

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:04.110
I think maybe you'll even become

00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:05.680
more popular than Brandy.

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:08.250
Girl,

00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:10.210
since you said that,

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:11.480
I'll have to

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:12.410
get rid of this haircut

00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:13.820
and my beard.

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:15.630
Come on, I'll take you home.

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:18.200
Home?

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:27.510
[Speeding Auto House]

00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:56.890
What's gotten into you?

00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:01.260
Jiang Mu told me

00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:04.370
I'd look fresher this way.

00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:17.500
So, what do you think?

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:19.360
Still as handsome as ever, right?

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:21.260
But I think

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:23.580
I'm a bit more handsome than you now.

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:26.430
Here.

00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:37.300
I'm back.

00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:39.470
-Mu, you're here.
-Mu.

00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:53.020
Sanlai?

00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:58.170
You... you...

00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:00.340
Why do you look like this now?

00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:04.650
Like what?

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:07.610
You had a haircut and you shaved?

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:12.430
I didn't know your features were so sharp.

00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:15.390
It's the first time
I've seen your forehead.

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:18.630
This style is so trendy,

00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:20.580
like an idol.

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:23.900
How do you like it?
I just bought all of this.

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:26.130
You look much cooler this way.

00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:27.930
These beads are so cute.

00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:28.780
Do they come in colors?

00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:29.970
I want the same ones.

00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:31.740
I got them for 19.90
at the store next door.

00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:32.360
What about this?

00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:40.670
Don't you remember?

00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:42.970
Last time you barged into my racing team

00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:44.770
when I wasn't paying attention.

00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:46.780
And the boxing match.

00:30:37.170 --> 00:30:38.970
I want you to fight a match for me.

00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:43.030
Your opponent
is He Zhang from Wan Shengbang's team.

00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:47.500
If you win,

00:30:47.930 --> 00:30:49.460
I'll give you a sum of money.

00:30:51.690 --> 00:30:54.020
I'll let you know
the time and place later.

00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:56.320
I didn't expect you

Then a pink pickup showed up,

that he was the one driving that night.

00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:09.270
I agreed to race him,
though I was suspicious.

That guy

00:31:11.370 --> 00:31:12.900
was arranged by you, right?

00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:18.610
One race,

00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:20.580

Why don't you go find him instead?

Get prepared.

Only one race left,

00:32:33.970 --> 00:32:35.370
and you can make the top 3.

There's still some time.

00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:47.460
Only by getting first

00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:49.420
can you transport their cargo.

00:32:49.870 --> 00:32:52.300
That way, Wan Shengbang's
secret business will be cut off,

00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:53.830
and we'll get the evidence.

00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:07.380

drive back then?

00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:39.210
As a top racer,

00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:42.370
one obviously needs

00:33:43.450 --> 00:33:44.410

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:19.110
Mastery.

00:34:20.110 --> 00:34:22.510

00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:32.489

the most essential part.

it's not enough

00:34:58.220 --> 00:34:59.820
for one to become a top racer.

00:35:00.930 --> 00:35:02.260
You need to be so skilled

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:04.490
that your hands
are faster than your brain,

00:35:04.490 --> 00:35:06.180
