kissasia.cam or kisskh.org

00:16.960 --> 00:18.480
Right.

00:19.240 --> 00:21.160
Here we go.

00:22.680 --> 00:25.120
Oh!

00:29.560 --> 00:31.640
Yes?

00:32.200 --> 00:34.760
Oh, hello. It's Trevor Bingley.

00:35.560 --> 00:36.440
Uh…

00:37.080 --> 00:39.360
From Housesitters Deluxe.

00:39.840 --> 00:42.760
Oh. Wait in the lobby.
I'll come down and get you.

00:43.840 --> 00:45.320
Okay. Thanks.

00:56.440 --> 00:57.800
Ooh.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.360
Coo…

01:05.640 --> 01:07.280
Where am I going to…

01:13.600 --> 01:15.680
-Mr. Bingley.
-Ah.

01:15.760 --> 01:19.480
Thank you for making yourself available
at such short notice. My name is Petra.

01:19.560 --> 01:22.120
I'm the executive concierge
for the Schwarzenboch family.

01:22.200 --> 01:24.000
The housekeeper would normally be here,

01:24.080 --> 01:26.320
but she's been called away
on a family emergency.

01:26.400 --> 01:29.720
Hence, our rather frantic search.
Uh, please.

01:40.520 --> 01:41.600
Heh.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.720
Do you mind if we dive straight in?
We have a lot to cover.

01:53.800 --> 01:54.640
Okay.

01:55.400 --> 01:59.680
First, to access the apartment,
you will need to use this fob.

01:59.760 --> 02:02.640
It's not required for the other floors,
but to access the penthouse,

02:02.720 --> 02:05.560
you need to touch the fob here
and press this button.

02:06.280 --> 02:07.680
Right.

02:11.800 --> 02:12.640
Heh.

02:18.720 --> 02:19.560
Excuse me?

02:22.240 --> 02:23.480
Nothing.

02:23.560 --> 02:25.200
I was just saying…

02:51.520 --> 02:53.000
This way, please.

02:55.040 --> 02:58.320
This is the London home
of Mr. and Mrs. Schwarzenboch.

03:01.880 --> 03:03.320
They have houses all over the world

03:03.400 --> 03:05.840
and haven't spent Christmas here
in at least ten years.

03:07.200 --> 03:08.360
Gosh.

03:08.440 --> 03:11.680
It should be a very quiet period
with no client contact of any kind.

03:12.360 --> 03:13.280
Right.

03:19.440 --> 03:21.320
Is everything all right?

03:22.880 --> 03:25.840
Uh-- Uh, yes. Yes.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.880
But we are naturally looking
for a highly responsible individual

03:31.960 --> 03:34.680
with all the attributes of elite staff.

03:34.760 --> 03:38.920
Discretion, sensitivity,
and above all, maturity.

03:42.160 --> 03:43.360
Right, yes.

03:49.080 --> 03:50.480
Sorry.

03:53.680 --> 03:55.920
Maybe I should show you the apartment.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.120
Uh…

03:58.200 --> 04:02.160
-Would you like to put your bag down?
-Yes. Um…

04:03.240 --> 04:05.480
Yes, I'll just leave it, um…

04:20.000 --> 04:21.840
Shh!

04:27.640 --> 04:28.960
Ah.

04:29.680 --> 04:32.040
This is the living room.

04:34.400 --> 04:36.120
Kitchen.

04:36.600 --> 04:40.600
Dining area. Terrace.
Please don't touch the piano.

04:40.680 --> 04:42.440
Thank you, Kenneth.

04:47.080 --> 04:51.360
Upstairs are the bedrooms,
the screening room, and the study.

04:52.720 --> 04:56.520
Guest suite, guest suite.
There are three more bedrooms this way,

04:56.600 --> 04:58.280
plus another steam room.

04:58.360 --> 05:02.200
The master suite's down this way,
plus another guest suite.

05:07.960 --> 05:12.160
The library, the conservatory,
and the yoga studio are through there.

05:12.240 --> 05:16.200
There's a panic room beyond the kitchen,
but you won't have access to that.

05:23.480 --> 05:26.320
Anyway, I'm sure you have
a lot of house-sitting experience

05:26.400 --> 05:28.280
with this level of accommodation?

05:29.000 --> 05:31.680
Oh, yes. Yes.

05:34.120 --> 05:37.360
Please don't touch the air-conditioning.
It's all fully automated.

05:38.720 --> 05:40.160
And it goes without saying,

05:40.240 --> 05:44.320
there must be no unauthorized guests
of any kind in the apartment.

05:45.840 --> 05:47.640
As long as that's clear.

05:54.280 --> 05:55.800
Perfectly clear.

05:56.320 --> 05:58.200
Right, let's carry on.

06:02.560 --> 06:05.240
Gym here. Sauna to the left.

06:06.280 --> 06:08.360
That's the laundry room.

06:11.640 --> 06:13.080
Lovely pot.

06:17.280 --> 06:20.840
Humidor, wine cellar.

06:20.920 --> 06:23.920
Utility room. Media closet.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.080
-Absolutely do not touch that.
-Where is it?

06:26.160 --> 06:30.680
And through there is the meditation space,
cold plunge, and golf simulator.

06:32.640 --> 06:35.400
Oh. Good. Good.

06:41.200 --> 06:42.640
Baby?

06:42.720 --> 06:43.920
Oh!

06:47.160 --> 06:48.720
Mr. Bingley?

06:50.880 --> 06:52.800
Oh. Yes.

06:55.760 --> 06:56.640
Oop.

06:58.080 --> 06:59.400
Come on.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.840
Well, this is the housekeeper's office.

07:02.920 --> 07:03.880
Um…

07:03.960 --> 07:10.200
A computer, printer, router,
modem, table linens, household supplies.

07:10.280 --> 07:11.120
Um… Oh.

07:11.200 --> 07:15.880
And these are the instruction leaflets
for the appliances. Uh. Mr. Bingley?

07:17.000 --> 07:18.320
Mr. Bingley?

07:25.600 --> 07:26.720
Hm.

07:28.520 --> 07:31.440
This is the kitchen. Obviously.

07:31.520 --> 07:36.120
Uh, Gaggenau, Miele, Wolf,
induction hob, Viking Range,

07:36.200 --> 07:38.240
two ovens at the end there,
and a pantry beyond.

07:38.320 --> 07:41.200
Which brings us
to the living room once again.

07:45.720 --> 07:46.800
Any questions?

07:47.400 --> 07:48.520
Uh…

07:48.600 --> 07:50.320
Well, just one, really.

07:50.400 --> 07:52.760
When will I know if I've got the job?

07:53.440 --> 07:55.040
Oh, you've got the job.

07:55.120 --> 07:57.160
It started 15 minutes ago.

07:57.240 --> 07:59.400
Ooh.

07:59.480 --> 08:02.400
The password for the Wi-Fi
is "Dom Pérignon."

08:02.480 --> 08:06.240
I'll leave the lift fob here.
Please don't lose it, there is only one.

08:06.320 --> 08:08.240
The cleaner, Elsa,
won't be in until the New Year,

08:08.320 --> 08:10.520
and the concierge
already left for his Christmas break.

08:11.120 --> 08:13.120
That is my cell phone number.

08:13.200 --> 08:17.840
You are free to contact me at any time,
though I am leaving for Thailand tonight.

08:17.920 --> 08:20.640
Haven't had a vacation in two years,
and would really appreciate it

08:20.720 --> 08:23.040
if you kept contact
to an absolute minimum.

08:23.720 --> 08:26.760
Well, I think that's everything.

08:27.280 --> 08:31.720
Right. So there's definitely
no one coming for Christmas?

08:34.040 --> 08:37.000
I don't have a single
member of staff on site.

08:38.200 --> 08:40.400
Apart from you, Mr. Bingley.

08:40.960 --> 08:44.560
If the Schwarzenbochs come for Christmas,
we are all in a lot of trouble.

08:49.200 --> 08:50.720
Happy Holidays.

09:08.720 --> 09:09.920
Huh.

09:31.320 --> 09:32.720
Oh, my goodness.

09:38.640 --> 09:39.720
Oh!

09:42.400 --> 09:43.760
Hello, you.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.920
A toy. Toy…

10:01.160 --> 10:02.240
There we go.

10:07.160 --> 10:09.520
-Hello?
-Hello. Is that Mr. Glee?

10:09.600 --> 10:12.720
-Well, yes.
-Hertfordshire Constabulary here.

10:12.800 --> 10:16.800
Oh, right. Well, I was just trying to say
that I've moved to a new address,

10:16.880 --> 10:19.120
in London. SW1.

10:19.200 --> 10:22.360
Ah, you've changed regions, then, sir.

10:22.440 --> 10:24.920
That makes it a matter
for the Metropolitan Police.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.280
I'll pass on your details.
They'll be in contact.

10:27.360 --> 10:29.200
Okay. Okay, thanks. Bye.

10:29.280 --> 10:30.320
Bye.

10:37.360 --> 10:39.120
You okay?

10:40.080 --> 10:42.200
Oh. I'm sorry.

10:45.280 --> 10:46.680
Oof.

10:47.920 --> 10:50.560
You need a nappy.

10:53.040 --> 10:55.520
Um, I might just…

10:56.800 --> 10:58.480
Oof.

11:11.560 --> 11:12.720
Oh.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.080
Ah.

11:25.960 --> 11:27.440
Oh, goodness.

11:36.760 --> 11:38.480
Oh.

11:48.400 --> 11:49.320
A-ha!

11:54.080 --> 11:55.360
Here we go.

11:58.280 --> 11:59.640
Okay.

12:05.680 --> 12:07.520
Ooh…

12:19.160 --> 12:21.360
Let's get you dried off, eh?

12:22.480 --> 12:24.640
Pee-po!

12:26.520 --> 12:28.040
Pee-po!

13:12.840 --> 13:14.040
Oh!

13:14.120 --> 13:15.000
Milk!

13:20.760 --> 13:21.760
Ah!

13:23.960 --> 13:25.240
Here we go.

13:26.000 --> 13:30.760
Right. Are you ready?
Yes, go on. There we go.

13:31.400 --> 13:32.440
Good boy.

13:40.800 --> 13:42.760
You're hungry.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.680
Are you ready?

13:50.440 --> 13:51.640
Oh.

13:55.360 --> 13:56.440
Oh!

14:03.480 --> 14:06.680
Now, where's the baby food?

14:09.160 --> 14:11.400
This looks like it here.

14:12.240 --> 14:15.200
Yes. Yes.

14:15.280 --> 14:17.040
That looks like the stuff.

14:17.120 --> 14:18.360
I think so.

14:18.960 --> 14:23.080
Oh. Now, Maddy used to love these.

14:23.160 --> 14:25.080
The only question is…

14:25.960 --> 14:27.720
the weight.

14:30.840 --> 14:31.960
Here we go.

14:33.240 --> 14:34.400
Nice.

14:36.720 --> 14:38.160
Are you ready?

14:39.160 --> 14:40.480
Okay.

14:40.560 --> 14:42.640
Good. And…

14:42.720 --> 14:45.320
There we go. 8.2 kilograms.

14:46.640 --> 14:47.920
There we are.

15:01.600 --> 15:03.720
Oh!

15:03.800 --> 15:05.200
Well, who's this?

15:07.440 --> 15:08.360
-Hello?
-Hello.

15:08.440 --> 15:10.480
Can I speak to Mr. Glee, please?

15:10.560 --> 15:13.680
Well, it's Bingley.
But yes, yes, that's me.

15:13.760 --> 15:17.600
My name's Georgia Hakopian.
I'm from Westminster Social Services.

15:17.680 --> 15:21.920
Metropolitan Police gave me your number
regarding a misplaced baby.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.240
Yes, I've got it right here.

15:24.760 --> 15:27.680
-And is the baby safe and well?
-Very much so.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.560
What time can you pick it up?

15:30.240 --> 15:32.080
I should be able to get there tomorrow.

15:32.880 --> 15:37.440
-Oh, so… So not tonight?
-No. I'm afraid we're very busy.

15:37.520 --> 15:40.200
We're operating with skeleton staff
due to the Christmas break,

15:40.280 --> 15:42.760
so it'll have to be
tomorrow afternoon, Mr. Glee.

15:42.840 --> 15:45.960
Somewhere between midday and 7:00 p.m.?

15:46.040 --> 15:48.680
-Oh, dear, dear, dear.
-Okay? Bye-bye.

15:48.760 --> 15:49.880
Okay, thanks. Bye.

15:50.400 --> 15:53.040
You've got me
for a little bit longer, I'm afraid.

15:59.840 --> 16:00.960
No?

16:02.360 --> 16:05.560
Oh.

16:05.640 --> 16:06.520
Ugh.

16:06.600 --> 16:08.920
Again?

16:29.480 --> 16:30.360
Well, now.

16:31.480 --> 16:33.520
Where are you going to sleep?

16:37.880 --> 16:39.240
Night-night, baby.

17:18.240 --> 17:20.640
Oh!

17:21.880 --> 17:23.240
Oh!

17:23.760 --> 17:25.040
Uh…

17:27.840 --> 17:30.880
What's wrong? What's wrong?

17:30.960 --> 17:34.400
Little Bo-Peep has lost her sheep

17:34.480 --> 17:37.560
And doesn't know where to find them

17:41.520 --> 17:44.080
You'd better watch out
You'd better not cry

17:44.160 --> 17:46.760
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

17:46.840 --> 17:51.760
Santa Claus is coming to town

17:56.680 --> 17:58.560
Ah!

17:58.640 --> 18:01.240
It was wind!

18:24.920 --> 18:27.240
You must be joking.

18:46.760 --> 18:47.600
Cheers.

19:04.400 --> 19:05.680
Oh.

19:05.760 --> 19:08.200
Oh, goodness.

19:08.280 --> 19:10.800
It's all right. I'm coming. I'm coming.

19:10.880 --> 19:12.200
Hello.

19:12.800 --> 19:14.360
You're going home today.

19:14.440 --> 19:16.080
Oh.

19:18.560 --> 19:19.880
Oh, no.

19:22.280 --> 19:23.400
Oh.

19:23.480 --> 19:24.680
Last one.

19:26.320 --> 19:27.560
Oh.

19:28.560 --> 19:30.640
Oh!

19:32.640 --> 19:35.720
Nappies.

19:37.800 --> 19:39.600
Should be just enough.

19:40.400 --> 19:41.240
Right.

19:51.040 --> 19:53.960
Deck the halls with boughs of holly

19:54.040 --> 19:57.320
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la…

20:02.040 --> 20:03.600
No!

20:05.440 --> 20:07.200
No!

20:07.280 --> 20:09.200
That's dangerous.

20:13.720 --> 20:15.160
Nappies.

20:27.800 --> 20:29.280
Oh. Uh…

20:29.360 --> 20:31.600
What do I press? What do I press?

20:32.240 --> 20:35.360
Um…

20:39.760 --> 20:41.040
Hello?

20:41.960 --> 20:43.080
Hello?!

20:45.000 --> 20:47.360
Oh!

20:53.640 --> 20:55.520
Wait! Wait!

20:55.600 --> 20:56.920
That's mine!

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
Sorry. I didn't quite
get to the thing in time.

20:59.080 --> 21:01.360
-There you are, mate.
-Thank you. Thank you very much.

21:15.240 --> 21:16.520
The fob.

21:23.160 --> 21:25.480
Oh, no. No! No! No!

21:27.040 --> 21:29.240
Oh, my God!
