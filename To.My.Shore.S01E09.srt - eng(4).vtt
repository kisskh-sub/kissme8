[To My Shore]

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.919
Rarely does a gift please me so much.

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:27.520
I have a meeting in half an hour,

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.960
so I can give you ten minutes before that.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.459
I brought Lu Zhen to apologize to you, Ms. Shi.

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.459
Apologize for what?

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.800
Love is about chemistry.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.860
If he isn't into me,

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.520
I can't force it.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.780
Honestly, at my age,

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.639
if I tried hard enough
I could probably have given birth to him.

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:49.819
Lu Zhen.

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:52.479
What are you waiting for? Apologize to Ms. Shi.

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:54.819
Ms. Shi, I'm sorry. I was wrong.

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.500
I didn't appreciate your intentions. I didn't know better.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.500
I didn't understand the situation, I...

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.420
Lu Zhen. If you're apologizing, show some sincerity.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.680
Is Ms. Shi's time for you
to waste with rambling?

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:08.980
Ms. Shi, I was wrong.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.780
I accepted the date
without understanding the situation.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.940
Please forgive me.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.359
Why does everyone make me
out to be the villain?

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:23.660
If I were you that day,

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.880
I wouldn't have let Lu Zhen walk out of that club in one piece.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.819
And I wouldn't have waited around
all day today,

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:31.299
carving time out of
a packed schedule to see him.

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:34.839
So, "villain" doesn't suit you at all.

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:41.719
Lu Zhen. Who told you to stand straight?

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.270
What...

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.439
Did they assign him a new agent?

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.439
Ms. Shi, I'm Lu Zhen's ex-boyfriend,
You Shu Lang.

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:56.299
Ex... what?

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:58.079
Boyfriend?

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.160
So, the agency recommended a gay guy to me?

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.299
Please don't be upset with the company.

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:07.120
This was all Lu Zhen's fault.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.359
He wanted the endorsement and wanted to build connections,

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:13.019
but he didn't communicate clearly
with the agency.

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:15.060
He accepted your campaign in a haze,

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.359
and he knew he shouldn't pretend
to be straight and deceive anyone.

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:19.840
He chickened out that night.

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.599
The company was furious.

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:23.739
They wanted to teach him a lesson.

00:04:24.739 --> 00:04:27.960
That cut on your forehead... Someone hit you?

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.259
I had it coming.

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:34.019
At least you've got a conscience.

00:04:34.019 --> 00:04:38.000
Better than the ones who pop pills
and still pretend to be straight fot a job.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.859
So, Lu was your... ex?

00:04:42.859 --> 00:04:44.560
Yes.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.759
And you still step up
when your ex is in trouble?

00:04:49.179 --> 00:04:50.759
This is the last time.

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:54.039
I'm paying back what we had.

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:58.079
After today, I'm done.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.000
Why break up?

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.340
He's such a good boyfriend.

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:43.979
Guess you weren't satisfied.

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:47.639
Some men can't share hardship,

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:50.859
some can't share riches.

00:05:50.859 --> 00:05:53.220
If I'd met a decent man,

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.259
I wouldn't be booking pretty little boys
every night to pass the time.

00:05:57.299 --> 00:05:59.060
Lu Zhen is young.

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.960
He idealizes everything.

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.380
Love, work, and the such.

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.919
He stumbled this time,
and I hope he'll learn from it.

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:13.499
So, please, show us kindness and forgive him.

00:06:13.499 --> 00:06:17.520
Not many men will lower themselves for an ex.

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:23.420
I'll sell you this favor, Mr. You.

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:28.159
I won't replace the spokesperson.

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:29.800
Lu Zhen.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.220
I liked you

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:35.900
because you reminded me
of my ex-husband when he was young.

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:41.100
Just don't become as vile as he ended up.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.653
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry.

00:06:56.359 --> 00:06:58.220
What a pity, Mr. You.

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.620
If you liked women,

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.540
no matter the cost,

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:04.900
I'd have made you mine.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.979
You're kind and beautiful. You'll meet the right person.

00:07:18.979 --> 00:07:21.039
The right person...

00:07:21.979 --> 00:07:25.520
Have you met yours?

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.919
Before that night,

00:07:27.919 --> 00:07:30.192
I thought I had.

00:07:31.326 --> 00:07:34.779
[Episode 9]

00:07:35.539 --> 00:07:37.839
Hello.

00:07:39.599 --> 00:07:41.680
This way, please.

00:07:43.299 --> 00:07:45.299
There you are, Director You.

00:07:45.299 --> 00:07:46.540
Second Young Master.

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:48.179
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:07:48.179 --> 00:07:49.419
Not at all.

00:07:49.419 --> 00:07:51.925
You're ten minutes early.

00:07:56.139 --> 00:07:58.000
Refined taste.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.039
Finding a traditional troupe
like this in Bangkok.

00:08:00.039 --> 00:08:01.759
Just putting on airs.

00:08:01.759 --> 00:08:04.220
Learning from our third brother.

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:09.079
Sampling Hua country's sights,
cuisine, and beauties.

00:08:12.479 --> 00:08:15.060
Let's be direct.

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:17.199
What did you want to see me about?

00:08:18.039 --> 00:08:21.479
I heard you and Fan Xiao broke up.

00:08:21.479 --> 00:08:23.019
Is it true?

00:08:23.019 --> 00:08:28.019
If we're going to talk in circles,

00:08:28.019 --> 00:08:29.540
we might as well enjoy the show.

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:32.860
Fine, cards on the table.

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:36.760
After what he did to you, you really don't want revenge?

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:40.340
What's funny?

00:08:41.279 --> 00:08:44.599
So, you have drawn your sword.

00:08:46.459 --> 00:08:47.680
Now, you want a blade to wield.

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.459
We each get what we need.

00:08:50.459 --> 00:08:53.079
Don't say I'm using you as a blade.

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:57.480
And in your view, how should I take revenge?

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.220
There are a million ways.

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:03.220
I've found you the simplest, quickest path.

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:06.680
Vent your anger and make some money.

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:12.519
Oh? Let's hear about the venting.

00:09:12.519 --> 00:09:16.499
Don't you want to hear how you profit first?

00:09:16.499 --> 00:09:20.599
I heard you've been trying
to sell your apartment to repay Fan Xiao.

00:09:20.599 --> 00:09:21.919
Don't bother with that.

00:09:21.919 --> 00:09:25.060
Help me with one thing.

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:27.620
Everything on this check is yours.

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:32.340
It's more than enough to cover your brother's debt and then some.

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.680
You get your anger out

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.880
and walk away with cash, best of both worlds.

00:09:39.699 --> 00:09:41.319
That much?

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.640
What do you need me to do?

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:47.159
Nothing difficult.

00:09:47.159 --> 00:09:54.139
Just slip this chip into Fan Xiao's work laptop.

00:09:54.139 --> 00:09:55.619
That's all.

00:09:55.619 --> 00:09:57.100
And then?

00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:59.190
Then we wait.

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.579
He's committing a crime?

00:10:04.579 --> 00:10:05.819
Director You.

00:10:05.819 --> 00:10:08.780
If he ends up in handcuffs,

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:11.026
won't that make you feel better?

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.499
I watched him build the tower high.

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:38.080
I watched him feast with guests.

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:41.280
I'll also watch the tower collapse.

00:10:45.599 --> 00:10:47.159
Second Young Master.

00:10:48.519 --> 00:10:50.459
There's nothing left between us.

00:10:50.459 --> 00:10:54.039
Settle your family feud yourselves.

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:06.100
Thank you for the tea, but it's gone cold.

00:11:07.459 --> 00:11:08.579
Director You.

00:11:08.579 --> 00:11:11.259
Wait, sit.

00:11:12.699 --> 00:11:17.220
I never took you for a man who swallows insult.

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:19.100
I've got a recording of Fan Xiao.

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:25.780
Don't you want to hear how he talked about you?

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:28.420
You wiretapped him?

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:30.479
Our third brother is too careful and sharp.

00:11:30.479 --> 00:11:32.019
I can't wiretap him.

00:11:32.019 --> 00:11:33.760
I bought the audio from the Shi family.

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.300
Shi Li Hua's people recorded it
while spying on him and that kept man.

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:36.760
I thought it interesting,

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:40.800
so I bought the audio they recorded
while spying on him.

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:41.880
I didn't expect what I heard.

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:45.880
Even I thought he went too far.

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:47.359
Director You.

00:11:47.359 --> 00:11:49.059
Want a listen?

00:11:49.839 --> 00:11:51.880
No, thanks.

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:53.660
I'm not interested.

00:11:56.959 --> 00:12:00.800
I was bored, used him to kill time.

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:04.519
When I was done, I tossed him.

00:12:04.519 --> 00:12:06.519
He didn't know his place?

00:12:06.519 --> 00:12:10.280
Fine, I'll coax him back, then dump him hard.

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:12.479
Director You, you can swallow that?

00:12:12.479 --> 00:12:14.379
I can't.

00:12:14.379 --> 00:12:17.499
As far as I know,
Fan Xiao still has a thing for you.

00:12:17.499 --> 00:12:19.479
Pretend to make up with him.

00:12:19.479 --> 00:12:21.300
Earn his trust

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:26.839
and then slip this chip into his laptop.

00:12:26.839 --> 00:12:28.559
Mission accomplished.

00:12:28.559 --> 00:12:31.200
You'll make money and vent your anger.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.479
Why not?

00:12:33.479 --> 00:12:35.079
Second Young Master.

00:12:35.819 --> 00:12:40.680
If you like the recording, keep it.

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:44.300
You're brothers.

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:49.699
Unique hobbies aren't surprising.

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:10.359
I'm going after that pervert.

00:13:10.359 --> 00:13:12.019
Used him to kill time.

00:13:12.019 --> 00:13:15.560
For now, it looks pretty good.

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:16.760
Wait, You Shu Lang.

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:18.559
I love you.

00:13:18.559 --> 00:13:20.919
I mean it, You Shu Lang.

00:13:20.919 --> 00:13:24.760
I was bored, used him to kill time.

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:28.000
When I was done, I tossed him.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.200
He didn't know his place?

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:31.559
Fine, I'll coax him back,

00:13:31.559 --> 00:13:33.800
then dump him hard.

00:14:14.159 --> 00:14:15.960
What's the matter? Good egg.

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:18.119
Bai Ting.

00:14:18.119 --> 00:14:19.919
I need a favor.

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:23.680
Get someone drunk for me.

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:26.760
How come I've never seen you?

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:28.640
New here?

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:29.960
New?

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.719
Are your eyes just blind to me?

00:14:31.719 --> 00:14:32.880
I'm hurt.

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:35.359
Isn't Bai Ting the sweet-and-pure type?

00:14:35.359 --> 00:14:36.840
Look at her outfit.

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:40.799
Those lashes on her lids could rake my face.

00:14:40.799 --> 00:14:42.280
She wants to latch onto Third Young Master.

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:47.520
Everyone knows he likes 'em curvy and bold.

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:51.400
How can my sweetie stop feeling wronged?

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:54.159
Want me to buy you a bag?

00:14:54.159 --> 00:14:56.599
I can't make you spend money, Young Master.

00:14:56.599 --> 00:15:01.520
How about three penalty shots instead?

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:03.080
Fine, fine.

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:06.559
Tonight, I'll drink with you till you're happy.

00:15:06.559 --> 00:15:10.680
But before we drink, let me have a kiss.

00:15:11.559 --> 00:15:13.760
Who are you?

00:15:15.679 --> 00:15:17.400
It's you.

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:18.679
You're...

00:15:18.679 --> 00:15:21.440
Don't remember me?

00:15:22.359 --> 00:15:25.799
Didn't you try to kiss me like that once?

00:15:25.799 --> 00:15:31.239
So... you swing both ways?

00:15:31.239 --> 00:15:32.479
Hell, I'm not!

00:15:32.479 --> 00:15:34.080
Don't try that extortion crap.

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:37.120
I didn't so much as lift a finger on you.

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:39.599
Young Master.

00:15:40.239 --> 00:15:42.479
You're so heartless.

00:15:42.479 --> 00:15:47.640
I came today to relive old times with you.

00:15:48.919 --> 00:15:50.320
Get lost.

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:52.080
I don't do men.

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:55.400
The hypocrite who ruined you was Fan Xiao.

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:56.520
You want to relive old times?

00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:58.280
Go find him.

00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:02.320
What, are you addicted from being molested?

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:04.520
You're sick.

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:07.119
I just pitied you.

00:16:07.119 --> 00:16:10.760
Didn't you used to think he was a good guy?

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:13.840
You're scaring me.

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:15.640
Come on, let's keep drinking.

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:18.320
Party on. Don't mind him.

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:19.559
Freak.

00:16:19.559 --> 00:16:21.039
Come on, don't mind him.

00:16:21.039 --> 00:16:23.000
- Let's drink.
- Okay.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.599
Bai Ting.

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:27.200
Let's go.

00:16:28.479 --> 00:16:29.719
The hell is your problem?

00:16:29.719 --> 00:16:32.320
Young Master, it's fine, really.

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:34.599
You go. It's fine.

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:37.680
Come on, keep drinking.

00:16:51.599 --> 00:16:55.039
Come on, cheers.

00:16:55.039 --> 00:16:56.959
Come on.

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:09.360
I envy you, finding a soulmate.

00:17:10.599 --> 00:17:12.360
Soulmate?

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:16.319
A bit much, isn't it?

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:18.400
What do you want?

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:21.160
To sleep with me?

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:22.959
You just want to fool around.

00:17:22.959 --> 00:17:26.720
You just want something new and exciting.

00:17:28.119 --> 00:17:29.280
You Shu Lang.

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:31.119
I love you.

00:17:31.119 --> 00:17:32.760
I'm serious.

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:36.880
When I picture the future, it's you I see.

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:41.359
I believe I never did anything to hurt you.

00:17:41.359 --> 00:17:43.160
I put you first in everything,

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.360
thought of you in all things.

00:17:47.079 --> 00:17:50.919
So, why? Why do you hate me this much?

00:18:17.719 --> 00:18:19.599
Fan Xiao.

00:18:19.599 --> 00:18:22.599
If you're lying to me,
then lie to me forever.

00:18:22.599 --> 00:18:24.399
I didn't lie to you.

00:18:25.959 --> 00:18:27.800
Don't dump me.

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:51.599
Hello?

00:18:51.599 --> 00:18:53.760
Lu Zhen.

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:56.760
Let's meet tomorrow afternoon.

00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:59.200
Bring the painting Fan Xiao gave you.

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:14.079
You never came when I invited you out.

00:19:14.079 --> 00:19:16.560
Ever since you dumped You,

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:17.880
you're finally open to invitations.

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:22.840
You should've dumped him sooner.

00:19:23.479 --> 00:19:25.800
Let's go.

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:28.839
Get in my car and let
my assistant drive us back.

00:19:28.839 --> 00:19:30.400
No, thanks.

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:32.040
I'll call a chauffeur.

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:35.319
You're as stubborn as a mule.

00:19:35.319 --> 00:19:36.719
Drive safely.

00:19:36.719 --> 00:19:40.080
Okay, okay, we're off.

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:43.039
Let's go.

00:19:51.599 --> 00:19:53.200
Fan Xiao.

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:00.639
You Shu Lang.

00:20:10.839 --> 00:20:12.839
You Shu Lang.

00:20:12.839 --> 00:20:15.320
I didn't think you'd be willing to meet me.

00:20:22.839 --> 00:20:25.000
I went to see Bai Peng Yu.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.840
How'd you find him?

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:30.080
He frequents these bars too?

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:46.320
Do you remember what you said that day?

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:49.760
The day after I was assaulted,

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:51.800
you sat in the car and told me

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:54.880
I must get my revenge.

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:57.680
Today, I used the gloves you bought me.

00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:01.200
Guess that makes your word good.

00:21:02.599 --> 00:21:06.039
I also prepared a pair of
lambskin tactical gloves.

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:11.279
I know you're pleased with my hands.

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:16.480
Tonight, how about...

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:25.280
Fan Xiao.

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:27.563
Can I trust you?

00:21:33.319 --> 00:21:36.520
I may not be much,

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:38.880
but I have my dignity.

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.759
If you're lying to me,

00:21:44.199 --> 00:21:46.560
then lie to me forever.

00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:48.759
Don't let me find out the truth.

00:21:50.479 --> 00:21:53.440
That's the greatest mercy I can give you.

00:21:56.479 --> 00:21:57.839
Fan Xiao.

00:21:57.839 --> 00:22:00.599
You're a high-stakes gamble for me.

00:22:00.599 --> 00:22:02.600
Can I win?

00:22:04.719 --> 00:22:07.520
Seems like there are no winners in this game.

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:09.680
Only losers.

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:12.200
And those who lose even more terribly.

00:22:15.959 --> 00:22:17.280
I can't run anymore.

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:19.039
Mom.

00:22:20.839 --> 00:22:22.359
I can't run anymore.

00:22:22.359 --> 00:22:23.959
Mom.

00:22:23.959 --> 00:22:25.079
Mom.

00:22:25.079 --> 00:22:26.079
Fan Xiao.

00:22:26.079 --> 00:22:27.199
Fan Xiao.

00:22:27.199 --> 00:22:28.319
It's just a dream.

00:22:28.319 --> 00:22:29.479
It isn't real.

00:22:29.479 --> 00:22:30.880
I'm here.

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:32.520
I'm here.

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:33.800
Fan Xiao.

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.399
I'm here.

00:22:42.319 --> 00:22:46.759
It's really over between me and You Shu Lang.

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:49.119
You Shu Lang.

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:52.560
What will it take for you to let it all out?

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:54.079
Fan Xiao.

00:22:54.079 --> 00:22:56.239
You're nothing special.

00:22:56.239 --> 00:22:58.479
Back then, I beat up Bai Peng Yu
for ten minutes.

00:22:58.479 --> 00:23:02.200
And I'd do the same to you.

00:23:14.924 --> 00:23:17.079
Things really are different now, huh.

00:23:17.079 --> 00:23:21.000
Before, you always pulled your punches.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.600
Now, every hit lands.

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:28.999
That means I'm special to you.

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:33.680
You want special treatment?

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:36.039
Fine, I'll oblige.

00:23:43.479 --> 00:23:45.119
Fan Xiao.

00:23:45.119 --> 00:23:47.879
That painting you gave Lu Zhen.

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:52.280
You left me a line on it.

00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:55.119
A Bodhisattva never falls into sin.

00:23:55.839 --> 00:23:57.440
If he won't fall,

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:00.840
drag him down.

00:24:01.839 --> 00:24:03.440
Here.

00:24:04.119 --> 00:24:06.599
Translate it.

00:24:06.599 --> 00:24:08.040
Say it in Thai.

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:13.359
You're my Bodhisattva

00:24:13.359 --> 00:24:16.319
and my god.

00:24:16.319 --> 00:24:17.760
Fan Xiao.

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:20.199
I really can't imagine now

00:24:20.199 --> 00:24:25.079
what all the Thai you whispered
in my ear meant.

00:24:25.079 --> 00:24:26.680
Fan Xiao.

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:32.879
You're in hell and still want to
drag me down with you.

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:35.440
Is that what you want?

00:24:38.119 --> 00:24:40.839
Who's this loser?

00:24:40.839 --> 00:24:43.560
How dare you lay hands on my buddy!

00:24:47.359 --> 00:24:48.960
Get lost!

00:24:51.079 --> 00:24:53.479
I guess I was being nosy, huh.

00:24:53.479 --> 00:24:55.479
Fan Xiao.

00:24:55.479 --> 00:24:58.880
If I ever interfere in your life again,

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:01.279
I'll take your last name.

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:34.239
Thank you for earlier.

00:25:34.239 --> 00:25:36.680
Now, I'll take a minute off.

00:26:06.839 --> 00:26:08.440
Fan Xiao.

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:11.960
I'll ask you one last time.

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.960
Why did you treat me in this manner?

00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:20.720
It's all my fault.

00:26:28.319 --> 00:26:31.199
Here's the money my brother owes you.

00:26:31.199 --> 00:26:33.491
The PIN is written on the card.

00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:38.079
Fan Xiao.

00:26:38.079 --> 00:26:41.512
Do you believe there's a god in this world?

00:26:47.359 --> 00:26:49.800
I've always thought the pendant on your chest

00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:52.039
looked ominous.

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:55.079
Looking closely,

00:26:55.079 --> 00:26:56.919
it resembles you.

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:05.680
But it was originally meant to guard the house.

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:07.360
As for you...

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:11.320
You belong in hell.

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:30.320
I know I'll go to hell.

00:27:31.319 --> 00:27:33.840
But I no longer want to end up there.

00:27:35.933 --> 00:27:38.853
Because you won't be there in hell.

00:27:40.012 --> 00:27:41.853
You Shu Lang.

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:44.960
I'll be in hell,

00:27:46.199 --> 00:27:48.519
But I won't find you there.

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:51.279
God...

00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:56.680
I don't want to fall into hell.

00:27:57.839 --> 00:28:01.159
Is it too late now?

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:44.439
Xiao Xiao.

00:28:44.439 --> 00:28:46.640
Come to Mommy.

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:48.680
Mom.

00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:50.160
Mom.

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:51.239
Don't be afraid, Xiao Xiao.

00:28:51.239 --> 00:28:53.520
I'm here with you.

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:54.919
Mom.

00:28:58.199 --> 00:29:00.079
- Mommy!
- Fan Xiao.

00:29:00.079 --> 00:29:01.479
Xiao Xiao, don't be scared.

00:29:01.479 --> 00:29:03.279
Come to Mommy.

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:08.040
Mommy, where are you?

00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:11.880
I only have one match left.

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:13.040
I...

00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:18.480
If I light it, will I see you?

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:22.719
Mom.

00:29:22.719 --> 00:29:25.199
You told me to live,

00:29:25.199 --> 00:29:29.960
but you didn't tell me who I should live for.

00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:33.954
Xiao Xiao.

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:43.199
Fan Xiao's Mother.

00:29:43.199 --> 00:29:44.599
Let's go. We can't wait anymore.

00:29:44.599 --> 00:29:47.519
We can't wait! Hurry up and drive!

00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:52.280
Mom.

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:54.479
I miss you so much.

00:29:54.479 --> 00:29:56.680
I want to go look for you.

00:29:57.319 --> 00:29:58.680
What happened?

00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:00.760
Has someone made you suffer?

00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:02.160
Mommy.

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:03.760
Mommy.

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:05.640
Mommy.

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:07.640
Daddy is so scary.

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:10.520
My brothers don't like me either.

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:15.079
Yes, the people who deserve
to die are still alive.

00:30:15.079 --> 00:30:17.479
How can I die?

00:30:17.479 --> 00:30:20.319
I have nothing.

00:30:20.319 --> 00:30:23.039
In that case, no one gets to be happy.

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:29.680
You won't have nothing.

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:30.880
You still have me.

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:32.720
You Shu Lang.

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:42.479
I'm here, it's okay.

00:30:42.479 --> 00:30:44.320
You Shu Lang.

00:30:46.719 --> 00:30:48.560
You Shu Lang.

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:52.599
Fan Xiao.

00:30:52.599 --> 00:30:54.119
From now on,

00:30:54.119 --> 00:30:56.040
don't show up in my life again.

00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:58.200
And don't let me see you again.

00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:00.599
You Shu Lang.

00:31:00.599 --> 00:31:02.119
Come back.

00:31:02.119 --> 00:31:03.520
You Shu Lang.

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:05.280
Come back here.

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:07.560
You really don't care about me anymore?

00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:10.159
You said you loved me.

00:31:11.959 --> 00:31:16.319
You told me not to care about any of it.

00:31:16.319 --> 00:31:18.760
You said you'd protect me.

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:20.319
Why don't your words count?

00:31:20.319 --> 00:31:24.319
You say you love me, and then you don't.

00:31:24.319 --> 00:31:26.560
Are you not Bodhisattva?

00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:28.719
Where is your compassion?

00:31:28.719 --> 00:31:31.160
Didn't you come to save me?

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:33.400
Why are you abandoning me?

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:34.640
You Shu Lang.

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:37.999
Who gave you permission to leave me?

00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:55.359
Did they all leave?

00:31:55.359 --> 00:31:57.719
You're all gone?

00:31:57.719 --> 00:32:00.279
No one wants me?

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:06.999
I can finally die as I wished.

00:32:24.623 --> 00:32:25.640
[Huang Qi Min]

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:27.919
Huang Qi Min.

00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:31.479
Hello?

00:32:31.479 --> 00:32:33.080
Mr. Huang?

00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:43.299
The equipment on the left will arrive soon.

00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:45.719
It's here. Send it over.

00:32:45.719 --> 00:32:47.119
Hurry up.

00:32:47.119 --> 00:32:49.119
What are you doing? Can you do it?

00:32:49.119 --> 00:32:51.763
- Director You.
- Director You.

00:32:51.763 --> 00:32:53.959
Come on, let's hurry.

00:32:53.959 --> 00:32:56.919
- What's Director You up to now?
- Don't mind him.

00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:02.359
Looks like staying in the dorm
won't work long-term.

00:33:02.359 --> 00:33:04.639
I had better move out soon.

00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:12.840
Mr. Huang?

00:33:14.479 --> 00:33:16.279
Hello, Mr. Huang.

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:19.320
You're in Thailand now?

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.359
You little rascal.

00:33:22.359 --> 00:33:24.040
You love teasing me.

00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:27.160
Back in school, you were the one
leading the "Boss Huang" chant.

00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:29.239
After you graduated,

00:33:29.239 --> 00:33:31.760
no one called me "Professor Huang" anymore.

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:33.119
Here.

00:33:33.119 --> 00:33:35.920
Got the best Tieguanyin
from the factory manager's office.

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:37.599
It's to make it up to you.

00:33:37.599 --> 00:33:39.199
Try it.

00:33:39.199 --> 00:33:42.560
Jokes aside, you're still the thoughtful one.

00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:45.839
You remember I like tea, huh?

00:33:45.839 --> 00:33:48.479
You said you needed me
for something on the phone.

00:33:48.479 --> 00:33:53.239
This R&D team in Thailand
wants to invite you to join.

00:33:53.239 --> 00:33:55.079
Invite me to join the R&D team?

00:33:55.079 --> 00:33:56.719
Yeah.

00:33:56.719 --> 00:34:00.279
Did you read the materials I sent you?

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:03.520
You mean the honeysuckle drink, right?

00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:06.280
Yes, that project.

00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:08.320
Once we can optimize the process,

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:10.560
It'll be quick to produce and launch.

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:12.399
No other pharmaceutical companies involved?

00:34:12.399 --> 00:34:13.399
There's some support.

00:34:13.399 --> 00:34:17.399
But the focus is on developing
the Changling brand.

00:34:17.399 --> 00:34:19.879
Once we get this project up and running,

00:34:19.879 --> 00:34:24.600
we'll be able to roll out
other projects one by one.

00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:28.199
Popular products in Thailand

00:34:28.199 --> 00:34:32.639
can be brought to market
under the Changling brand.

00:34:32.639 --> 00:34:36.000
For the investor thinks as long as
marketing is done right,

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.239
we can easily make the brand a success.

00:34:39.239 --> 00:34:41.840
Investor? Capital has already been injected?

00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:44.879
Yeah. Where else would we get the money?

00:34:44.879 --> 00:34:47.800
And besides, we only know R&D.

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:50.199
We're not in sales.

00:34:50.199 --> 00:34:51.959
- Got it.
- Shu Lang.

00:34:52.679 --> 00:34:54.840
You're my best student.

00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:59.840
With your exam scores,
you were overqualified for our school.

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:02.479
You had such great graduate scores.

00:35:02.479 --> 00:35:06.360
But you rushed to work
to support your younger brother.

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:09.399
You couldn't continue your studies.

00:35:09.399 --> 00:35:13.280
And you ended up in a job
that wasn't in your field.

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:17.199
I've never felt easy about that.

00:35:17.199 --> 00:35:22.239
I guess our teacher-student
bond persists even now.

00:35:22.239 --> 00:35:26.679
In Thailand, I can't make it here
without someone I trust.

00:35:26.679 --> 00:35:28.840
Come help me.

00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:31.800
Teacher.

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:34.360
But my current job...

00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:36.840
No one's helping me climb up.

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:40.120
I'm climbing to the top on my own.

00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:43.320
You made it to your position on your own.

00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:46.199
You've made it to where you are at Bohai.

00:35:46.199 --> 00:35:47.239
And it wasn't easy.

00:35:47.239 --> 00:35:48.959
But ask yourself this.

00:35:48.959 --> 00:35:51.530
Do you like this job?

00:35:57.959 --> 00:35:59.800
Can't say I like it.

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:00.800
Drinking and chatting.

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:02.399
Welcoming and sending people off.

00:36:02.399 --> 00:36:04.080
I've long grown tired of it.

00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:05.513
But right now...

00:36:05.513 --> 00:36:07.760
Worried about wages?

00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:09.520
Don't be.

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:11.919
We have an investor.

00:36:11.919 --> 00:36:15.280
Come be my deputy team lead

00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:18.080
and manage all external affairs.

00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:22.080
I'll pay you... this much.

00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:24.320
A few years apart and you're a brand-new man.

00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:27.199
You've really become a boss.

00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:29.159
Right.

00:36:29.159 --> 00:36:33.399
I heard you sold your apartment
and need a place.

00:36:33.399 --> 00:36:36.320
The investor's covering more than money.

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:40.781
Offices and housing are included.

00:36:42.164 --> 00:36:44.097
If I stay at Bohai,

00:36:44.097 --> 00:36:46.400
I'll inevitably meet Fan Xiao again.

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:47.800
He's unpredictable,

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:51.120
and I've already been
irrational in this relationship.

00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:54.000
Maybe leaving now is the smartest move.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.800
Well?

00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:59.000
You in?

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.320
Sir, I'll let you make the arrangements.

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:04.479
Good. We're set.

00:37:04.479 --> 00:37:06.719
The project's already started.

00:37:06.719 --> 00:37:08.840
I need you on-site ASAP.

00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:13.600
So, resign tomorrow and come over.

00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:15.199
Tomorrow?

00:37:16.199 --> 00:37:20.479
I'll need time to hand over my work.

00:37:20.479 --> 00:37:24.800
And who's the investor behind this team?

00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:27.800
It's...

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:30.959
Xinruida.

00:37:30.959 --> 00:37:32.080
Xinruida.

00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:34.999
Funding stuff isn't your lane.

00:37:34.999 --> 00:37:37.120
You wouldn't know them.

00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:38.840
Yeah.

00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:40.120
All right, sir.

00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:42.279
I'll get on it quickly.

00:38:12.879 --> 00:38:14.679
Sir.

00:38:14.679 --> 00:38:15.879
Oh, Shu Lang.

00:38:15.879 --> 00:38:17.199
Have a seat.

00:38:18.879 --> 00:38:20.279
Take a seat.

00:38:23.919 --> 00:38:28.239
Shu Lang, I'm glad you're leading the cleanup.

00:38:28.239 --> 00:38:30.463
This room finally looks presentable.

00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:35.399
Professor Huang, what's the deal
with the investor?

00:38:35.399 --> 00:38:38.199
I still know nothing.

00:38:38.199 --> 00:38:39.250
You just arrived.

00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:42.360
Your to-do list is a mile long.

00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:45.000
Investors are just money men.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.560
There's no need to study them.

00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:50.959
Anyway, they'll be here in a minute.

00:38:50.959 --> 00:38:52.560
We'll talk when we meet.

00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:54.280
Okay.

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:56.239
Mr. Huang, your guests are here.

00:38:56.239 --> 00:38:57.759
Please.
