Your Highness,
what brings you to the palace?

00:01:36.519 --> 00:01:37.599
Take me to His Majesty.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.680
At a time like this,

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:42.359
you still wish
to seek His Majesty's help

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:44.159
to escape this marriage?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.159
Unless you marry me tomorrow obediently,

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:54.640
otherwise,

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.400
you will never see
His Majesty again in this lifetime.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.959
You...

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:00.599
Zhou Cheng.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:03.780
Escort Her Highness
back to her chambers.

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:05.519
Your Highness, please.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.660

=Episode 23=

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.120
What is it?

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:34.700
Am I not welcome here, Your Highness?

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.360
It is not yet the auspicious hour.

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:39.120
Why rush to meet?

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.039
I care little for those rules.

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:45.120
Your Highness.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.120
I know you value affection.

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:49.560
But...

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.120
Even if you grieve

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.960
for Li Yuanze who is gone,

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.039
it should end here.

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.919
After all,

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:02.759
you are now a married woman.

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:05.120
And in your heart,

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:08.319
there should be room
for only your husband.

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:10.240
Do you not agree?

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:18.080
I understand.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.360
I told you once.

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:22.000
As long as you behave as you should,

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.599
everything

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.319
will be yours to have.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.340
(Li Residence)

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:36.240
Yuanze.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.599
It is time.

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:43.400
Song.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.599
You remain outside the palace.

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:49.479
If anything happens to me...

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:50.159
Yuanze.

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:52.560
I must go with you.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.560
This path is perilous.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.039
Besides,

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.159
Her Highness and His Majesty
are both trapped inside.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.800
Even if it means walking through fire,

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.840
I have to break through myself.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.920
Gan Sheng.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.279
Your time has come.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.000
(Taiji Hall)

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.800
Gan Sheng.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.160
You crippled my daughter's legs

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:54.879
and still pretended to be righteous,

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:56.079
tricking me into serving you.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.120
You are shameless beyond measure.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.319
Today

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:00.560
will be the day you die.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.800
Qian Yong.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.319
You think taking down the palace guards

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:05.920
means victory is already yours?

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.399
Generals, to arms.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.839
Qian Yong.

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:22.319
Surrender while you still can.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.040
The one who should surrender

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:28.399
is clearly you.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.000
Very well.

00:05:42.399 --> 00:05:43.480
Grand Secretary.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.160
Why are you all standing there?

00:05:45.519 --> 00:05:47.040
Take him down as well.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:06.240
Grand Secretary.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.680
His Majesty has been rescued.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.439
You call yourselves generals,

00:06:13.399 --> 00:06:15.879
yet now you serve
a civil official like dogs.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.000
I trusted you deeply.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.839
Is this how you repay me?

00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:22.319
They followed you into battle,

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:23.319
risking their lives.

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:24.480
But you?

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:26.639
You stole military funds
and sold grain illegally.

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:28.000
You conspired with foreign forces.

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:29.439
Did you think of them then?

00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:32.720
So many

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.199
good soldiers of Jing

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:36.040
did not fall on the battlefield

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:37.839
but at the hands of their own comrades.

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.519
Such unforgivable sins,

00:06:40.759 --> 00:06:41.920
can you bear them?

00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:44.800
They did not betray you.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.360
It was you who betrayed them.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:59.639
- Kill.
- Kill.

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:00.720
Gan Sheng.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000
You have lost.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:12.680
Your Highness.

00:07:12.959 --> 00:07:13.639
Your Highness.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:15.759
There is chaos in the palace.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:16.720
Grand Secretary.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.000
How is the Grand Secretary?

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:19.680
He is unharmed.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.720
He told me to take
Your Highness away at once.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:24.199
Very well.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:26.519
Gan Sheng.

00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:28.079
Your end has come.

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.839
Withdraw now

00:07:30.079 --> 00:07:31.600
and I may grant you a whole body.

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:33.000
Grand Secretary.

00:07:33.959 --> 00:07:35.639
Do not speak too soon.

00:07:39.319 --> 00:07:40.240
Look.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:41.560
Do you recognize her?

00:07:47.879 --> 00:07:48.680
Your Highness.

00:07:49.959 --> 00:07:50.680
Prince Wu'an.

00:07:51.079 --> 00:07:51.759
All you commanded

00:07:51.759 --> 00:07:53.079
has been done.

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.040
Your Highness.

00:08:07.279 --> 00:08:08.399
Forgive me.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.079
I had no other choice.

00:08:11.519 --> 00:08:13.040
Please tell me,

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:14.519
where is my foster son?

00:08:14.519 --> 00:08:15.480
Do not worry.

00:08:18.279 --> 00:08:20.439
I shall reunite you
father and son right now.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:22.920
Li Yuanze.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:24.100
Stand your troops down.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.120
Or I kill her.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:25.800
You dare?

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.160
Try me if you wish.

00:08:31.079 --> 00:08:31.879
Li Yuanze.

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:32.720
Archers.

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:33.279
Do not mind me.

00:08:33.279 --> 00:08:34.080
Grand Secretary.

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:36.919
Will you abandon her again

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:38.320
for the sake of power?

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:44.720
Five years ago,

00:08:45.039 --> 00:08:46.600
you already failed her once.

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.200
And now you will watch her die

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.559
by my sword?

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.039
Truly, Princess Royal

00:08:54.559 --> 00:08:55.960
deserves better.

00:08:57.919 --> 00:08:58.840
Li Yuanze.

00:08:59.639 --> 00:09:01.159
You think your plans flawless,

00:09:01.159 --> 00:09:02.200
victory assured,

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:03.399
yet in the end

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:06.440
you still fall into my hands.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:20.799
Li Yuanze.

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:25.840
I always liked the ending
of Qingya and White Deer.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.639
If not for you back then,

00:09:29.639 --> 00:09:31.240
I would have died far from home.

00:09:31.679 --> 00:09:32.480
Your Highness.

00:09:33.039 --> 00:09:33.919
This time,

00:09:35.879 --> 00:09:37.639
let me return the favor.

00:09:39.399 --> 00:09:40.240
