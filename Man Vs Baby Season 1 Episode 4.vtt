00:08.480 --> 00:12.280
You're green Not only in the summertime…

00:12.360 --> 00:14.480
The Schwarzenbochs are coming?

00:14.560 --> 00:15.520
Yes.

00:16.040 --> 00:18.360
So, what are we going to do?

00:18.440 --> 00:20.880
Well, I've tracked down Janet,
the housekeeper.

00:21.480 --> 00:23.800
She's agreed
to take care of the preparations.

00:23.880 --> 00:26.480
She lives nearby, so she won't be long.

00:26.560 --> 00:29.160
You are to stay in the apartment
until she arrives,

00:29.240 --> 00:31.360
at which point
you'll be dismissed and can go home.

00:32.280 --> 00:33.320
Oh.

00:33.400 --> 00:34.600
But on full pay.

00:35.200 --> 00:36.080
Oh!

00:36.760 --> 00:38.400
Right. I'm sorry.

00:38.480 --> 00:41.200
I've got to get this.
Uh, the housekeeper will be in contact.

00:50.320 --> 00:52.200
Jingle bells, jingle bells

00:52.800 --> 00:54.760
Jingle all the way

00:54.840 --> 00:56.280
Oh, what fun it is…

01:02.120 --> 01:03.720
-Hello?
-Hello, dear.

01:03.800 --> 01:05.440
I'm Janet,

01:05.520 --> 01:07.400
the Schwarzenbochs' housekeeper.

01:07.480 --> 01:09.600
-Oh.
-I'm afraid we have got a problem.

01:09.680 --> 01:13.520
Right. Yes, I heard.
But you're not far away, are you?

01:13.600 --> 01:15.520
Oh, well, that's the problem.

01:16.240 --> 01:18.400
I've been a bit of a naughty girl,
you see.

01:18.480 --> 01:21.720
Petra, she thinks I'm in Chiswick.
I'm actually in Perthshire with my mother.

01:23.840 --> 01:25.680
You're in Scotland?

01:25.760 --> 01:27.720
Listen, it'll be no problem at all.

01:27.800 --> 01:31.360
I'll head to the station shortly,
and I will be with you later on tonight.

01:31.960 --> 01:32.920
Oh, okay.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.280
Oh, nothing to worry about.

01:35.360 --> 01:37.000
I've come up with a plan.

01:37.080 --> 01:40.320
Now, there's a credit card
in the drawer in the kitchen office.

01:40.400 --> 01:45.320
If I send a wee list to your printer,
could you make a start on the shopping?

01:55.280 --> 01:58.200
Gosh. That's quite a list.

02:22.760 --> 02:23.960
Finally.

02:40.960 --> 02:44.240
All right, little man.
Let's see if there's any room at the inn.

02:49.840 --> 02:54.120
Chocolate with figs. Chocolate with figs.

02:54.200 --> 02:55.200
A-ha!

02:56.080 --> 02:57.640
Chocolate with figs.

02:57.720 --> 02:59.320
There we go.

03:00.040 --> 03:01.080
And…

03:01.600 --> 03:05.160
And Dom Pérignon Champagne.

03:06.800 --> 03:07.880
Ah!

03:07.960 --> 03:09.960
Champagne. Here we are.

03:10.040 --> 03:12.760
Yes. Dom Pérignon.

03:13.960 --> 03:15.120
Oof.

03:15.760 --> 03:17.080
Goodness.

03:19.200 --> 03:20.040
Ah.

03:20.120 --> 03:21.120
Huh.

03:22.120 --> 03:24.080
"Twenty-four"?

03:26.520 --> 03:27.360
Okay.

03:36.800 --> 03:38.840
There we go.

03:38.920 --> 03:40.360
Another one down.

03:44.880 --> 03:45.720
Mrs. Hakopian?

03:45.800 --> 03:47.520
I was about to head for the station,

03:47.600 --> 03:49.320
but I remembered one other thing.

03:49.400 --> 03:51.440
Herr and Frau Schwarzenboch

03:51.520 --> 03:54.000
cannot do
without their Trüffelstreichwurst.

03:54.720 --> 03:56.080
Their what?

03:56.160 --> 03:59.040
Spreadable sausage, dear,
with the calf's liver and white truffle.

04:00.360 --> 04:01.360
Thank you.

04:02.440 --> 04:04.160
Goodness. Ooh.

04:04.760 --> 04:07.680
Now, we're going to need another trolley.

04:08.680 --> 04:11.440
This is a CAT 1 emergency.
Immediate priority.

04:11.520 --> 04:14.640
We have a missing infant.
Repeat, missing infant.

04:30.640 --> 04:33.120
All units, we have a missing baby. Over.

04:39.360 --> 04:41.040
Ah.

04:47.720 --> 04:50.040
And the baby was definitely
in the car seat when you left?

04:50.120 --> 04:52.600
Yes! Yes, I strapped him in myself.

04:52.680 --> 04:54.600
You've reached Georgia Hakopian.

04:54.680 --> 04:56.920
Please leave a message after the tone.

05:26.600 --> 05:27.680
Oh, hello.

05:28.280 --> 05:29.120
Um…

05:30.520 --> 05:34.600
I just wanted to apologize again
for the whole mix-up with the baby.

05:35.120 --> 05:36.400
And, uh…

05:36.480 --> 05:38.280
And to give you these.

05:42.800 --> 05:45.040
They're really nice, actually.

05:46.720 --> 05:47.720
It's very kind of you.

05:49.120 --> 05:50.960
-Okay.
-Thank you, Trevor.

06:07.480 --> 06:08.400
Yeah.

06:08.480 --> 06:11.320
Well, I hope you have a good Christmas.

06:13.480 --> 06:15.840
Yeah. I'll, uh…

06:15.920 --> 06:17.920
-I'll just slide this.
-Thank you.

06:25.920 --> 06:27.840
Come on, Archie.

06:27.920 --> 06:28.920
Hayley!

06:29.000 --> 06:31.280
Hello, Annabel. Hello, Archie.

06:31.800 --> 06:33.040
Right.

06:33.120 --> 06:34.520
Here we go.

06:34.600 --> 06:35.840
Now, then.

06:36.400 --> 06:38.520
It is not your shoe, I've told you.

06:38.600 --> 06:39.760
Give.

06:41.760 --> 06:44.000
There we go. Thank you.

06:44.080 --> 06:45.440
No problem.

06:46.920 --> 06:50.440
You have a lovely-wovely time! Bye! Bye!

07:02.520 --> 07:05.240
There you are. Here, Archie.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.760
-Huh.
-Let's go.

07:16.720 --> 07:17.680
Stay here.

07:17.760 --> 07:19.760
Archie! Come back!

07:21.160 --> 07:22.520
No! No! Get off!

07:24.000 --> 07:27.520
Sorry! I'll bring him straight back down!

07:30.760 --> 07:33.520
Get off! No!

07:34.120 --> 07:36.720
Archie, where are you going?

07:46.040 --> 07:48.160
Right. Come on, let's go.

07:48.800 --> 07:49.640
Let's go.

07:52.200 --> 07:53.520
Hello, Annabel?

08:09.280 --> 08:11.440
Hello!

08:11.520 --> 08:13.720
Dog lady?

08:15.680 --> 08:17.680
Oh, no.

08:26.160 --> 08:27.040
Ah.

08:40.360 --> 08:42.880
Oh! No. Archie! Archie!

08:43.480 --> 08:45.160
Give me that shoe!

08:45.760 --> 08:46.600
Archie!

08:50.360 --> 08:53.480
No! Not the spreadable sausage!

08:55.640 --> 08:57.640
Oh!

09:08.280 --> 09:09.280
Oh…

09:10.240 --> 09:11.560
Look.

09:11.640 --> 09:13.960
Look what I've got.

09:14.040 --> 09:15.560
A shoe.

09:15.640 --> 09:19.880
A lovely shoe for you.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.440
Come and get it, Archie.

09:21.520 --> 09:23.360
Oh!

09:25.040 --> 09:26.520
No, not the fob!

09:26.600 --> 09:30.600
Let go. Let go, Archie. Let go. Good dog.

09:30.680 --> 09:32.440
Let go! Let go.

09:32.520 --> 09:35.040
Let…

09:35.120 --> 09:37.240
Oh, no. Oh, no.

09:39.880 --> 09:42.560
No!

09:42.640 --> 09:45.480
Not the fob! Not the fob!

09:45.560 --> 09:47.120
Where is it?

09:52.600 --> 09:53.440
Oh!

10:12.160 --> 10:13.320
Phew!

10:18.600 --> 10:19.800
Mrs. Hakopian?

10:19.880 --> 10:22.080
Listen, I'm afraid
the weather's atrocious up here,

10:22.160 --> 10:25.120
and the trains, love,
they're all over the place.

10:25.200 --> 10:29.280
So, I'll take the overnight sleeper.
Would that be all right?

10:29.360 --> 10:30.600
Oh.

10:31.120 --> 10:32.480
Um…

10:32.560 --> 10:36.320
And if you could make a wee start
on decorating the flat, I'd appreciate it.

10:36.400 --> 10:39.040
There's decorations
in the storage unit downstairs.

10:39.120 --> 10:41.320
Okay. Uh…

10:41.400 --> 10:43.600
-And we're gonna need a Christmas tree.
-Oh!

10:44.200 --> 10:46.080
Where do you think
I could get one of those?

10:46.160 --> 10:49.680
Oh, don't worry about that.
I will have Geoff drop one off.

10:49.760 --> 10:52.040
He does all the flora and fauna
for the penthouse.

10:52.120 --> 10:53.880
Will you need help setting it up?

10:53.960 --> 10:56.080
Oh, no, that won't be necessary.

10:56.160 --> 10:58.440
I've set up
a fair few Christmas trees in my time.

10:58.520 --> 11:02.320
Of course you have. I do like you, Trevor.

11:02.400 --> 11:04.080
You did you get the spreadable sausage?

11:04.160 --> 11:05.240
Oh.

11:05.760 --> 11:06.600
Uh…

11:10.160 --> 11:11.160
Yes.

11:11.760 --> 11:14.480
-Yes, I did.
-Full marks, dear.

11:14.560 --> 11:17.080
I knew we were in safe hands with you.

11:17.160 --> 11:19.120
I'll see you first thing in the morning.

11:19.200 --> 11:20.800
Okay. Bye.

11:20.880 --> 11:21.720
Archie!

11:22.320 --> 11:25.320
No! No, no, no, no, no!

11:29.160 --> 11:31.600
-Hello?
-This is Annabel from the third floor.

11:31.680 --> 11:35.600
I got your note and was just wondering
if you could bring my dog downstairs?

11:36.400 --> 11:37.480
Oh…

11:39.160 --> 11:40.920
No.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.320
I'm sorry,

11:43.400 --> 11:44.920
because…

11:45.800 --> 11:48.560
I'm out at the moment.

12:01.800 --> 12:04.640
Well… when will you be back?

12:04.720 --> 12:09.200
Well, that's a bit difficult to say.

12:09.800 --> 12:12.040
Two hours?

12:12.120 --> 12:14.680
Three, maybe?

12:15.480 --> 12:17.640
Why don't I call you when I get back?

12:37.840 --> 12:39.000
Ah. Hello, Trevor.

12:39.080 --> 12:40.560
Lionel, how are you?

12:40.640 --> 12:42.480
Today's the day, having to move out.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.520
I can't believe it's actually happening.

13:06.240 --> 13:08.000
Here we are.

13:23.040 --> 13:24.200
Goodness.

13:27.200 --> 13:29.960
What am I even going to put it in?

14:31.040 --> 14:31.880
Good.

14:32.840 --> 14:36.040
Now all we need to do is decorate it.

14:36.120 --> 14:38.280
While someone's having a sleep.

14:39.800 --> 14:40.960
Come on.

14:54.760 --> 14:55.960
Sheep.

14:59.720 --> 15:01.120
Straw.

15:03.920 --> 15:05.000
Ah.

15:07.320 --> 15:10.240
Archie, come on.

15:15.440 --> 15:16.880
All right.

15:21.360 --> 15:22.520
Ooh…

15:23.720 --> 15:25.720
Huh.

15:27.320 --> 15:28.160
Oh!

15:57.600 --> 15:58.440
Good.

16:02.680 --> 16:03.560
You need a poo.

16:04.160 --> 16:07.000
At last, you need a poo!

16:07.520 --> 16:08.480
Come on, Archie.

16:08.560 --> 16:09.920
Go on.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.440
That's right.

16:13.280 --> 16:14.680
Good boy.

16:16.120 --> 16:18.680
That's right. Go on. Go on.

16:19.520 --> 16:22.080
Yes. Well done, Archie.

16:23.160 --> 16:24.240
Now, then.

16:25.840 --> 16:27.960
Uh…

16:32.040 --> 16:34.440
I need a sort of…

16:36.200 --> 16:37.040
Oh!

16:37.120 --> 16:38.480
Well, look at that.

16:42.600 --> 16:43.560
Good.

16:44.440 --> 16:45.560
Here we go.

16:53.440 --> 16:54.280
Oof.

16:59.400 --> 17:00.640
Right.

17:00.720 --> 17:01.960
Now…

17:11.400 --> 17:12.440
Ooh!

17:12.520 --> 17:14.160
Yes! Yes!

17:14.240 --> 17:16.440
Yes, it's there! Ah!

17:29.480 --> 17:30.320
Oh!

17:30.400 --> 17:33.520
Ah! There he is! There's my boy!

17:33.600 --> 17:36.040
Oh! Did he do his business?

17:36.120 --> 17:38.160
-Did he?
-He certainly did.

17:38.240 --> 17:41.920
Oh, what a good boy! There's my good boy!

17:42.000 --> 17:43.760
Oh, well, thank you for looking after him.

17:43.840 --> 17:45.720
-That's all right.
-Are you going up?

17:45.800 --> 17:47.240
Yes. Yes.

17:48.280 --> 17:49.960
Uh…

17:50.040 --> 17:53.400
And, uh, you're the,
uh, penthouse, aren't you? Hm.

18:29.800 --> 18:32.280
Night-night, Baby Jesus.

18:47.120 --> 18:48.880
-Hello?
-They've canceled everything.

18:48.960 --> 18:51.040
There's no trains running at all.

18:51.120 --> 18:53.400
-I'm not gonna make it.
-What?

18:53.480 --> 18:56.920
You'll have to prepare the Christmas feast
for the Schwarzenbochs yourself.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.240
What do you mean? How many--

18:59.320 --> 19:01.920
Only 12. Possibly 14.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.840
Sixteen at the outside.

19:03.920 --> 19:07.480
Now, the Schwarzenbochs arrive
at five o'clock, so that's your deadline.

19:07.560 --> 19:08.480
Five o'clock?

19:08.560 --> 19:11.400
-Oh, there's no need to panic, Trevor.
-Janet, that's…

19:11.480 --> 19:13.440
Oh, do not worry, hen.

19:13.520 --> 19:15.680
I was up the entire night at the station,

19:15.760 --> 19:18.960
and I've written down
step-by-step instructions.

19:19.040 --> 19:21.880
They should be coming through
to you any minute.

19:39.240 --> 19:41.080
"Christmas feast."

20:47.360 --> 20:48.200
Eh…

20:58.040 --> 20:59.080
Heh.

21:23.120 --> 21:23.960
Oh.

21:45.720 --> 21:46.640
Ah.

21:46.720 --> 21:50.120
Good evening.
If you would like to come through?

21:50.880 --> 21:53.040
If you would like to come?

21:53.680 --> 21:54.840
Ah.

23:04.560 --> 23:07.320
Hello, it's Janet.
Please leave a message after the beep.

23:09.800 --> 23:11.320
Hm…

23:20.560 --> 23:23.720
-Hello?
-Oh, hello, Petra. It's me, Trevor.

23:23.800 --> 23:25.080
Sorry, Trevor who?

23:26.040 --> 23:26.880
Trevor Bingley.

23:28.240 --> 23:29.680
From the flat in London.

23:29.760 --> 23:32.440
I'm still here because Janet,

23:33.040 --> 23:35.120
who's also here,

23:35.720 --> 23:38.320
uh, asked me to help out
with a few bits and pieces.

23:38.920 --> 23:42.320
And she asked me to

23:42.400 --> 23:46.200
let you know that
the Christmas feast is ready,

23:46.280 --> 23:49.680
but that there's still no sign
of the Schwarzenbochs.

23:49.760 --> 23:50.840
I'm so sorry.

23:50.920 --> 23:52.000
I, um…

23:52.080 --> 23:56.000
I meant to call her,
but it completely slipped my mind. Um…

23:56.080 --> 23:59.840
Could you tell her
the Schwarzenbochs aren't coming?

23:59.920 --> 24:02.400
Uh, they diverted to New York
at the last minute.

24:02.920 --> 24:04.320
Not coming?

24:04.400 --> 24:07.080
O Christmas tree

24:07.160 --> 24:09.640
O Christmas tree

24:09.720 --> 24:15.000
How loyal are your branches!

24:15.080 --> 24:18.520
Oh, please tell her how sorry I am.
I hope she didn't go to too much trouble.

24:19.240 --> 24:20.320
Well…

24:20.400 --> 24:22.240
Uh, she, um…

24:22.320 --> 24:23.880
Now, look, I've got to go.

24:23.960 --> 24:26.000
I've got the New York housekeeper
on the other line.

24:26.080 --> 24:30.120
But, um, will you wish Janet
a very merry Christmas from me?

24:30.200 --> 24:33.840
And, um, please say thank you again.
She's been so wonderful.

24:33.920 --> 24:35.280
Happy Holidays.

25:09.920 --> 25:11.240
Hello?

25:11.320 --> 25:13.320
Sorry to bother you, sir.
Metropolitan Police.

25:13.400 --> 25:15.600
Uh, we're making inquiries
about a missing baby

25:15.680 --> 25:17.440
we understand
was previously in your charge.

25:17.520 --> 25:20.200
Oh! Yes! Yes!

25:20.280 --> 25:21.440
Yes, it's right here.

25:22.360 --> 25:24.160
You mean, you've got the baby?

25:24.240 --> 25:26.800
Yes. I'll bring it right down.

25:26.880 --> 25:28.360
Come in.

25:32.120 --> 25:34.040
Come on, baby. Let's go.

25:36.240 --> 25:37.280
-Ah.
-Ah.

25:37.360 --> 25:39.840
Well, well, well.
What do we have here, then?

25:42.000 --> 25:43.120
-Ah.
-Oh!

25:43.200 --> 25:44.640
This is him, is it?

25:44.720 --> 25:46.640
You've been very busy, haven't you?

25:46.720 --> 25:49.360
Led everyone on a right little dance.

25:50.160 --> 25:51.280
Here we go.

25:54.600 --> 25:55.440
Uh…

25:56.440 --> 25:59.040
Doesn't, uh, appear to be
the same baby, sir.

26:00.160 --> 26:01.520
Oh, no, it isn't.

26:02.600 --> 26:04.160
That's the wrong baby.

26:05.240 --> 26:06.800
This is the right baby.

26:07.440 --> 26:10.640
I had the wrong baby
when I gave it to Mrs. Hakopian, you see.

26:10.720 --> 26:13.120
And then while I was going back
to get the right baby,

26:13.200 --> 26:15.160
that was when she drove off.

26:15.240 --> 26:16.080
Ha!

26:18.880 --> 26:21.960
Why not let the caseworker sort this out?
If that's okay with you, sir?

26:22.040 --> 26:23.240
Right. Yes.

26:24.960 --> 26:29.800
Uh, control? This is DS-one-nine.
Can you get the FLO on site ASAP?

26:29.880 --> 26:31.080
Ah…

26:31.160 --> 26:34.280
I think I'm going to have to feed him.
Do you want to come upstairs?

26:35.240 --> 26:37.760
I think I probably should, sir, yeah.

26:59.800 --> 27:01.120
Here we are.

27:02.120 --> 27:03.960
Please, come in.

27:15.720 --> 27:17.480
Oh, wow!

27:17.560 --> 27:19.320
You've got yourself
quite a place here, sir.

27:19.400 --> 27:22.800
Oh, no, it isn't mine.
I'm just the house sitter.

27:22.880 --> 27:24.120
Ah.

27:25.760 --> 27:28.400
Can I offer you something to drink
while you're waiting?

27:28.480 --> 27:29.560
Oh, uh…

27:29.640 --> 27:32.960
I'm afraid
we've only got vintage champagne.

27:34.040 --> 27:37.040
Hello, hello, hello.

27:37.120 --> 27:38.720
Oh, bless you.

27:41.600 --> 27:42.600
Oh, hello.

27:43.200 --> 27:46.920
-Hello, Trevor. Do you have a minute?
-Uh, yes. I'll buzz you up.

27:47.960 --> 27:49.640
Sorry to bother you, Trevor.

27:49.720 --> 27:52.720
We just wanted to say
thank you for the presents.

27:52.800 --> 27:55.040
-And to give you this.
-Yeah.

27:55.120 --> 27:58.280
-Oh, goodness.
-It's a chewable Peppa Pig set.

27:58.360 --> 28:01.400
River loves them.
We thought your baby would too.

28:01.480 --> 28:04.800
Ah, that's really, really kind. Thank you.

28:04.880 --> 28:06.800
What you are…

28:06.880 --> 28:09.680
Would you like to come in for a mince pie?

28:09.760 --> 28:12.360
Or some stollen cake?

28:12.440 --> 28:16.120
Last Christmas I gave you my heart…

28:21.400 --> 28:26.920
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special…

28:27.000 --> 28:28.560
Hello, Lionel.

28:28.640 --> 28:32.160
Herr Scrooge says I've got
to leave these with you, apparently.

28:33.680 --> 28:36.680
Oh! Archie! Come back!

28:36.760 --> 28:40.240
Sorry, Trevor. We were in the lift
when you buzzed Lionel up.

28:40.320 --> 28:42.200
Archie!

28:42.760 --> 28:44.680
Still can't believe this is really it.

28:45.200 --> 28:46.600
The final goodbye.

28:47.800 --> 28:48.920
Oh.

28:50.200 --> 28:51.840
Can I offer you a drink, Lionel?

28:51.920 --> 28:53.320
Oh…

28:57.040 --> 28:58.040
Jess!

28:58.120 --> 28:59.360
How are you?

28:59.440 --> 29:01.160
How's Barbados?

29:02.040 --> 29:04.160
We're not in Barbados, Trevor.

29:04.680 --> 29:06.080
We're in London.

29:06.160 --> 29:07.000
Oh.

29:07.080 --> 29:10.360
We spent two days at Heathrow
waiting for our flight to go,

29:10.440 --> 29:12.400
and then last night at an airport hotel.

29:12.480 --> 29:14.840
And then, after another seven-hour wait,

29:14.920 --> 29:16.560
they canceled the flight.

29:16.640 --> 29:20.160
Jess, I'm so sorry.

29:20.240 --> 29:22.840
So we're in a taxi
on our way back into town.

29:22.920 --> 29:24.000
Is Maddy okay?

29:24.080 --> 29:25.000
Well,

29:25.080 --> 29:26.760
that's why I'm calling.

29:26.840 --> 29:29.520
I realize it might be asking an awful lot,

29:29.600 --> 29:33.320
and I know we've already messed you about
this Christmas, but…

29:35.000 --> 29:37.320
do you think there's any way
we could come to you, after all?

29:37.920 --> 29:40.360
Well, yes, I think there probably is.

29:40.440 --> 29:43.640
-But I'm in a different place.
-What do you mean? Where are you?

29:44.640 --> 29:45.600
Oh!

29:45.680 --> 29:48.360
Jess, I've got to go,
but I'll text you the address.

29:48.440 --> 29:50.920
Georgia, come on up.

29:51.440 --> 29:53.880
Ding-dong, merrily on high

29:53.960 --> 29:56.400
In heav'n the bells are ringing

29:56.480 --> 29:58.360
Ding-dong, verily the sky

29:58.440 --> 30:01.640
Is riv'n with angel singing…

30:01.720 --> 30:04.480
Happy Christmas, Archie.

30:08.880 --> 30:11.320
Hosanna in excelsis

30:11.400 --> 30:17.760
Glo

30:17.840 --> 30:18.680
Ria

30:18.760 --> 30:21.680
Hosanna in excelsis

30:38.800 --> 30:41.360
Are you sure this is the right address?

30:43.560 --> 30:44.960
Dad!

30:46.640 --> 30:48.760
Hello, sweet pea.

30:48.840 --> 30:49.760
Hello, Jess.

30:49.840 --> 30:50.880
Hello.

30:50.960 --> 30:54.520
Dad, this place is amazing.

30:54.600 --> 30:56.720
What is this?

30:56.800 --> 30:58.520
And who are all these people?

30:58.600 --> 31:01.040
Well, it's a bit of a long story.

31:01.120 --> 31:03.120
Oh!

31:03.200 --> 31:06.960
-Whose baby is this?
-Oh, the baby's mine.

31:07.040 --> 31:08.240
What?

31:08.800 --> 31:10.480
What do you mean, Dad?

31:11.440 --> 31:13.360
Well, not mine-mine.

31:13.440 --> 31:15.200
It's part of the long story.

31:15.280 --> 31:18.200
Well, it's a story
that keeps getting longer, to be honest.

31:18.280 --> 31:21.400
Because despite all our best efforts
at social services,

31:21.480 --> 31:26.160
we have absolutely no idea
where this baby has come from.

31:34.680 --> 31:35.760
You've got two?!

31:37.200 --> 31:39.240
Mom, can I give you that? I won't eat it.

31:42.480 --> 31:45.040
And it's been so long…

31:45.120 --> 31:46.480
Happy Christmas, Jess.

31:46.560 --> 31:47.680
Cheers!

31:48.360 --> 31:50.760
So how do you know these people?

31:52.000 --> 31:55.240
To pass the time away…

31:55.320 --> 31:57.120
Uh, bread sauce?

31:57.200 --> 31:59.440
Oh, uh, they don't do dairy.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.440
Oh, that must be really hard.

32:04.960 --> 32:07.560
Everyone! Everyone!

32:08.320 --> 32:11.880
I think it's high time
someone proposed a Christmas toast.

32:11.960 --> 32:13.800
-Ah!
-To Trevor.

32:13.880 --> 32:14.920
Oh!

32:15.000 --> 32:16.680
To Trevor.

32:16.760 --> 32:17.800
To Dad.

32:17.880 --> 32:21.240
Oh, and… and to the baby
that brought us all together.

32:21.840 --> 32:23.640
To the baby!

32:30.960 --> 32:33.080
Uh, where is the baby?

32:33.160 --> 32:34.680
He was just here.

32:34.760 --> 32:36.160
Oh, no.

32:36.240 --> 32:37.360
Under the table?

32:38.480 --> 32:39.640
Can't be far.

32:39.720 --> 32:41.280
-Check the curtains.
-Yes.

32:41.360 --> 32:44.120
Yes, you do that side and I'll…

32:47.920 --> 32:49.560
Jesus?

32:51.360 --> 32:53.240
Baby Jesus?

32:53.320 --> 32:55.200
Where are you?

32:56.080 --> 32:57.080
Baby?

33:00.600 --> 33:01.560
Baby?

33:04.520 --> 33:05.960
He's here!

33:08.800 --> 33:11.480
He's here!

33:19.720 --> 33:20.760
Mm…

33:25.520 --> 33:26.640
Oh.

34:07.760 --> 34:08.800
Hello?

34:09.400 --> 34:11.360
Happy Christmas, Janet.

34:11.440 --> 34:16.080
We decided we could not miss
your Christmas feast after all.
