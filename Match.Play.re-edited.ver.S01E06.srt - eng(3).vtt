00:00:03.208 --> 00:00:06.208
It seems he's very busy.

00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:07.500
It's a shame,

00:00:07.625 --> 00:00:10.225
but we'll have to save our call with
Gu Jae-yeon for another time.

00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:11.042
Yes.

00:00:11.167 --> 00:00:12.417
This is Gu Jae-yeon.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.292
Oh, Gu Jae-yeon! Hello.

00:00:18.042 --> 00:00:19.250
Yes, hello.

00:00:19.375 --> 00:00:21.042
Wow, who is this?

00:00:21.167 --> 00:00:22.958
If it isn't our very own Gu Jae-yeon.

00:00:28.792 --> 00:00:30.000
How have you been?

00:00:31.042 --> 00:00:32.958
Yes, I've been well.

00:00:34.292 --> 00:00:36.333
Weren't you supposed to be extremely busy?

00:00:36.458 --> 00:00:37.958
Seems like you're doing just fine.

00:00:39.583 --> 00:00:41.417
You haven't changed a bit, Moon Do-ha.

00:00:41.542 --> 00:00:43.417
That doesn't sound like a compliment.

00:00:45.792 --> 00:00:47.083
How have you been?

00:00:48.542 --> 00:00:50.000
I've been... okay.

00:00:51.042 --> 00:00:52.417
Doesn't sound like it.

00:00:59.292 --> 00:01:00.417
Gu Jae-yeon.

00:01:02.375 --> 00:01:03.917
Want to play some basketball?

00:01:04.833 --> 00:01:05.833
You'll come, right?

00:01:07.125 --> 00:01:08.833
It's fine if you don't.

00:01:09.417 --> 00:01:10.958
I'll be there.

00:01:12.292 --> 00:01:12.792
See you in a bit then.

00:01:12.917 --> 00:01:15.250
What was that... Moon Do-ha!

00:01:15.375 --> 00:01:16.375
No...

00:01:29.458 --> 00:01:31.042
Hey, are you crazy?

00:01:31.167 --> 00:01:33.143
There's an uproar for "basketball court and "Moon Do-ha" right now!
[Note: He's most likely talking about real-time trending topic]

00:01:33.167 --> 00:01:35.250
I didn't mention a
location, so don't worry.

00:01:35.375 --> 00:01:37.292
Hey! You really...

00:01:37.417 --> 00:01:40.250
That's not the point right now!

00:01:40.375 --> 00:01:42.417
Can't we just let it go?

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:43.833
I'll try harder.

00:01:44.667 --> 00:01:46.417
No, I'll do a good job.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.833
With the members.

00:01:50.875 --> 00:01:52.750
I'll have a good talk with them, too.

00:01:52.875 --> 00:01:54.542
Do-ha, there's this thing...

00:01:57.708 --> 00:02:00.042
Oh, he's here.

00:02:00.167 --> 00:02:01.167
I'm hanging up.

00:02:01.708 --> 00:02:02.708
Hey! Hey!

00:02:02.792 --> 00:02:04.542
Moon Do-ha!

00:02:08.792 --> 00:02:11.167
Who hangs up the phone like that?

00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:12.958
Me?

00:02:19.125 --> 00:02:20.833
Did I do something wrong?

00:02:23.542 --> 00:02:24.625
You didn't.

00:02:25.625 --> 00:02:26.667
Liar.

00:02:33.708 --> 00:02:35.250
If I'm being annoying,

00:02:35.375 --> 00:02:36.667
just say so.

00:02:37.542 --> 00:02:39.000
Stop avoiding me all the time.

00:02:42.542 --> 00:02:44.417
Then I'll try to be less annoying.

00:02:49.125 --> 00:02:50.333
Otherwise,

00:02:51.208 --> 00:02:53.608
do you want me to show you
what being truly annoying is like?

00:03:03.875 --> 00:03:06.542
What if you're even more annoying than now?

00:03:06.667 --> 00:03:07.917
What do you mean, "what if?"

00:03:08.042 --> 00:03:10.375
You just have to put up with me.

00:03:13.375 --> 00:03:15.500
Stop laughing and answer me.

00:03:17.583 --> 00:03:18.750
Answer me.

00:03:33.667 --> 00:03:34.976
I'll give it to you if you answer.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.500
If you answer, I'll give it to you.

00:03:36.625 --> 00:03:37.000
Answer me!

00:03:37.125 --> 00:03:38.250
Give it to me!

00:03:38.375 --> 00:03:40.208
The ball's right here.
Why can't you get it?

00:03:40.333 --> 00:03:41.708
You should just answer.

00:03:58.417 --> 00:04:00.500
But you actually came, so it seems

00:04:00.625 --> 00:04:02.792
you don't hate me that much, right?

00:04:07.292 --> 00:04:10.292
Honestly... I'm not so sure.

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:13.958
Not sure about what?

00:04:15.625 --> 00:04:18.042
If it's okay for me to
be like this with you.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.833
Moon Do-ha, you know, don't you?

00:04:23.667 --> 00:04:26.083
Reality isn't that simple.

00:04:33.042 --> 00:04:34.958
Let's go. It's getting late.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.250
I know.

00:04:39.375 --> 00:04:40.625
I know, but...

00:04:41.583 --> 00:04:44.263
But no matter how I think about
it, it doesn't seem like I hate it.

00:04:46.208 --> 00:04:48.375
Honestly, what's the big deal?

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:49.917
As long as we don't get caught.

00:04:51.167 --> 00:04:52.847
It's fine as long as it's just between us.

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:03.375
See?

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.417
You obviously don't hate it.

00:05:07.417 --> 00:05:08.750
So why act like that?

00:05:13.208 --> 00:05:15.208
I don't really remember.

00:05:20.833 --> 00:05:22.553
You have something to say to me, don't you?

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:26.292
You have something to say.

00:05:27.458 --> 00:05:28.708
You have to.

00:05:40.625 --> 00:05:42.167
Come closer.

00:06:39.042 --> 00:06:40.042
Hey.

00:06:40.667 --> 00:06:42.643
It looks like Jae-yeon and Moon Do-ha
are up to something again.

00:06:42.667 --> 00:06:43.867
Are you going to get involved?

00:06:44.708 --> 00:06:46.083
I don't know.

00:06:53.708 --> 00:06:55.958
But Park Soo-hyun, aren't
you interested in dating?

00:06:56.083 --> 00:06:58.500
There are so many guys here.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.417
Hey! I'm all about a guy's face.

00:07:03.542 --> 00:07:05.333
And I've seen plenty.

00:07:05.458 --> 00:07:08.083
I plan to live my life
looking at handsome faces.

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:10.417
What about a guy with a nice body?

00:07:12.708 --> 00:07:15.468
You're the one who kept bringing
it up and tricked me into saying it.

00:07:16.167 --> 00:07:18.125
So which is it, face or body?

00:07:36.875 --> 00:07:38.833
What's this? You actually came.

00:07:39.625 --> 00:07:41.083
I told you I would.

00:07:42.542 --> 00:07:44.708
It must be nice being in a relationship.

00:07:44.833 --> 00:07:46.113
You get to see each other often.

00:07:46.208 --> 00:07:47.750
And it's easy to keep in touch.

00:07:50.833 --> 00:07:52.042
What's wrong?

00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:56.208
Is it just... you can't help but smile
whenever you see my face now?

00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:58.542
Yeah.

00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.542
Seat belt.

00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.958
But did you forget?

00:08:13.083 --> 00:08:14.583
We agreed to speak casually.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.917
You can't back out now.

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:21.083
I'll get to it.

00:08:23.333 --> 00:08:25.500
Why are you so slow at everything?

00:08:32.917 --> 00:08:34.397
You're not putting on your seat belt?

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.417
You were slow to accept my confession, too.

00:09:09.375 --> 00:09:10.375
Should we go?

00:09:10.417 --> 00:09:11.875
Oh?

00:09:12.708 --> 00:09:14.083
Oh...

00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.042
A drama?

00:09:33.167 --> 00:09:34.625
For me?

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:36.601
The most anticipated project
for the second half of next year.

00:09:36.625 --> 00:09:37.625
You'll take it, right?

00:09:37.667 --> 00:09:39.375
Ah, yes, but...

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:40.667
who's the lead?

00:09:40.792 --> 00:09:43.375
Director, I'm here!

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:44.958
Hey, what are you doing?!

00:09:45.083 --> 00:09:46.601
The most anticipated project
for the second half of next year.

00:09:46.625 --> 00:09:48.583
Starring Moon Do-ha!

00:09:48.708 --> 00:09:49.500
Moon Do-ha!

00:09:49.625 --> 00:09:51.917
And the martial arts director is... you!

00:09:52.042 --> 00:09:53.250
You.

00:10:05.792 --> 00:10:06.792
Okay, one more time!

00:10:06.917 --> 00:10:07.583
Yes!

00:10:07.708 --> 00:10:09.542
Four, five, six.

00:10:09.667 --> 00:10:11.083
Seven, eight.

00:10:11.208 --> 00:10:12.958
Nine, ten.

00:10:16.167 --> 00:10:17.708
Did you make up

00:10:17.833 --> 00:10:19.125
with the members?

00:10:19.458 --> 00:10:22.375
Yeah, just do a good job
and stick with it for a long time.

00:10:23.458 --> 00:10:26.417
Oh, so you made up?

00:10:28.833 --> 00:10:30.208
Of course we had to.

00:10:32.083 --> 00:10:33.417
Good job.

00:10:36.208 --> 00:10:37.208
What the heck.

00:10:37.333 --> 00:10:39.542
Then you'd better do a
good job on this project.

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:43.083
Hey! Underwater scenes,
horse riding scenes...

00:10:43.208 --> 00:10:44.833
you'd better get ready.

00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:48.917
We just got cast. Why are
you talking about this now?

00:10:49.292 --> 00:10:52.375
Once filming starts, they'll
train you to death anyway.

00:10:52.833 --> 00:10:53.917
So...

00:10:54.042 --> 00:10:55.833
you're not gonna do it?

00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.458
Of course I'm doing it.

00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.375
Of course I am.

00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.059
We should at least go
out for a day or two, right?

00:11:02.083 --> 00:11:03.443
That's how it should be, isn't it?

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.292
A day?

00:11:08.417 --> 00:11:10.351
Didn't you used to just fool
around while you worked?

00:11:10.375 --> 00:11:11.875
Don't you remember?

00:11:23.875 --> 00:11:25.000
Wanna bet?

00:11:25.125 --> 00:11:26.375
Bet what?

00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:28.542
The winner gets one wish granted.

00:11:28.667 --> 00:11:30.042
What wish?

00:11:30.167 --> 00:11:31.375
Just agree first.

00:11:34.125 --> 00:11:35.250
Why can't you say it?

00:11:35.375 --> 00:11:36.958
What is the wish?

00:11:37.792 --> 00:11:39.250
I'll tell you when I win.

00:11:39.375 --> 00:11:41.292
You've never beaten me before.

do you...

00:11:53.375 --> 00:11:55.333
like Moon Do-ha's type?

00:11:55.458 --> 00:11:57.083
Well...

00:11:57.208 --> 00:11:58.542
for starters,

00:12:00.167 --> 00:12:01.708
you're not it.

How do I turn this off?

There, it's off.

00:13:02.292 --> 00:13:03.083
Nothing happened, right?

00:13:03.208 --> 00:13:04.500
Of course not.
