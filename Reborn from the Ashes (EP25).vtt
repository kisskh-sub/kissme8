[Reborn from the Ashes]

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.440
[Episode 25]

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.630
I falsely accuse you?

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.840
Wanyan Jin, since you're so jealous,

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.000
I'll let you have your fill this time.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.960
My Lord,

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.880
a jealous man is destined
to be abandoned.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.800
Be quiet.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.750
I'm still upset.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.360
I was wrong.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.400
But you have to promise me,

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.110
stay away from Prince Han.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.710
I don't like him.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.960
You say you're not jealous.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.960
Who in the world doesn't like you?

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:10.840
Today it's Prince Han,

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.960
tomorrow another man will be after you.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Do I have to worry every moment

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.630
that you will be taken away?

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.630
Do you really think
I'm such a fickle woman?

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:23.550
Even if Prince Han

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:25.980
is more handsome than you,

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:27.480
richer than you,

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.670
I am still your wife.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.670
Say that again.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.150
More handsome than you,

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.920
richer than you.

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:44.750
He is more handsome than you.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.680
Why did you lure me here
with the account book?

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.520
Can't we just have a proper talk?

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:01.360
Speak.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.070
What exactly do you want?

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.070
I want

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.710
you dead.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.150
Someone!

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.400
Save my child!

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.360
Someone!

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.840
Yi, are you alright?

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.840
Yi, are you OK?

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:22.480
Your Highness,

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.150
please save our child.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.850
Stop right there!

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.590
Bring the physician here.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.750
Your Highness,

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.400
Qingran didn't push me on purpose.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.320
I was careless myself.

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.190
Feiyi! Hurry up!

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.590
Your Highness,

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:44.960
the child is lost.

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.800
What?

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.400
Qingran,

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.040
you have quite the nerve.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.920
Knowing Feiyi is pregnant,

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.770
yet you still invited her
to the pavilion.

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.070
If she hadn't informed me before coming,

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.590
did you really think
you could get away with it?

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.040
I didn't push her.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:03.630
Your Highness,

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.040
since this child has no ties to us,

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.790
there's no need to press the matter
further.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:09.800
Nonsense.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.000
Someone!

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.110
Take her away.

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:14.330
Hit her 20 times with a cane.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.420
Lock her up in the prison.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.960
Yes.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:19.770
I'll walk there myself.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.670
Feiyi.

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.710
I was only away from home
for three days,

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.160
and you already got into trouble.

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.480
Su Feiyi used the account book
to trap me.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.420
That's how it ended up like this.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.480
Think carefully.
Was there anything strange back then?

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.710
How dare they bully my woman
while I was away?

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.800
I'll make sure they all pay the price.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.520
I've figured it out.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:24.960
Young Master,

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.670
I saw the truth behind the pavilion
that day.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.710
Su Feiyi framed the crown princess.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.040
She deliberately caused her own fall
and miscarriage.

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.170
I originally wanted
to testify for the crown princess.

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.810
But His Highness was so intimidating.
I dared not speak the truth.

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.270
Su Feiyi,

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.440
how dare you treat us like fools?

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:51.670
I have completed the task.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.320
You may leave now.

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:26.520
Su Feiyi...

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:47.800
Wen Yueqian?!

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.630
You...

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:52.670
How did you...

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.230
Do you want to ask

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.920
how did I return from the underworld?

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.320
Of course, it is for three matters.

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:06.920
First,

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.590
the grudge of disfigurement.

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:14.710
Second,

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.400
the hatred of eye gouging.

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:19.260
No!

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.150
Third,

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.040
the pain of bloodletting.

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.360
Just keep waiting,

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.270
waiting for your blood

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:39.190
to run dry.

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:41.400
Then all of this will be over.

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.230
Yueqian,

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.880
I was wrong.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.040
Wen Yueqian, I was wrong.

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:47.320
What mistake did you make?

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.420
I shouldn't have deceived you
to take your pure Yang blood.

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:55.520
I shouldn't have been unfaithful
with Su Feiyi.

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:57.620
I shouldn't have gouged out your eyes,

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:00.320
ruined your face,
or endangered your life.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:01.880
I should never

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.520
have gotten Su Feiyi pregnant.

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:06.190
I was wrong.

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:11.040
But sadly, there's no cure for regret.

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:13.710
A mistake is a mistake.

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:16.520
Just go ahead and regret it slowly.

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:40.670
Wen Yueqian, please don't kill me.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:43.320
Qi,

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.320
make sure you clearly see
who I really am.

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:55.270
Su Qingran.

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:57.360
Just now...

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:01.670
You scoundrel!

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:04.070
Confess everything.

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:09.800
Before,

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:12.520
I went through so much
to find pure Yang blood for you.

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:13.750
Yet you,

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:15.670
for Su Feiyi,

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.390
killed Wen Yueqian.

00:08:18.391 --> 00:08:24.895
(Watch on www.dramacool.club Support Admin)

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:19.680
And now,

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.470
you're scheming with her again,

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.000
joining forces to deceive me.

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:25.390
I was framed as well.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:26.680
Go guard the tomb.

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:27.800
Don't ever come back.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.070
I know my mistake.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:34.600
Your Highness.

00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:38.960
Your Highness, don't do this.

00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:40.640
Qi is too fragile.

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:43.230
He just can't take it.

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.150
It's all Su Feiyi's fault.

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:48.230
She must have seduced Qi.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:49.640
Hmph.

00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:51.560
Since you feel sorry for him,

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:53.800
then go with him.

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:54.840
Your Highness.

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:57.040
Still making a scene here.

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:17.600
Su Feiyi,

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:22.600
you really treat me like a fool.

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:25.430
Someone!

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.880
Demote Su Feiyi to slave status

00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:31.510
and throw her out of the Mansion.

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:38.760
Your Highness, I didn't do it.

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:40.840
They're framing me.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:43.150
Don't forget my original intention.

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:45.040
Silence.

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:48.560
I will handle

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:50.390
today's matter myself.

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:52.040
You all go back first.

Su Feiyi,

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:03.960
I can refrain from demoting you
to slave status,

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:07.510
but you can no longer stay here.

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:09.760

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:10.800
In a few days,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.800
I will send someone to escort you away.

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:16.190
The wealth and honor you desire,

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:17.840
I will give it to you.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:21.150
Don't bring up the account book
ever again.

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:25.070
Yes.
