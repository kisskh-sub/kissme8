Luo?

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.559
Luo?

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.319
Early this morning,

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:07.680
she had me book a train ticket.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.840
And just one ticket.

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:10.639
And the destination?

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.879
Where to?

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:12.599
Central Plaza?

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.440
Central Plaza?

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.039
Liangxi! One more to go!

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:16.280
Beauty, going to Central Plaza?

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.199
20 yuan. 20 yuan only.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.960
No need.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:18.479
Liangxi?

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:19.560
- Just need one more to go.
- No.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.120
Liangxi.

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:21.520
Last spot. Cheap now.

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:22.479
Going to Liangxi?

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.440
(Welcome to Anta Station)
To Liangxi, young man?

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.608
Liangxi? Leaving immediately.

00:02:25.832 --> 00:02:26.759
Get in and we'll go.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.680
Liangxi? Just one person needed.

00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:53.489
Dad!

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.570
Little girl, leave here first.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:57.209
Be good.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.769
He jumped from the rooftop?

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:02.049
That's so high.

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:09.690
Mom.

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:13.810
Luo.

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:15.489
Luo.

00:03:21.937 --> 00:03:23.177
Why do you keep following me?

00:03:24.096 --> 00:03:24.976
I keep following you?

00:03:25.536 --> 00:03:26.937
You ran off without a word.

00:03:27.136 --> 00:03:28.217
I've been looking for you.

00:03:29.017 --> 00:03:29.897
I left without a word

00:03:29.897 --> 00:03:31.376
just to stop you from following.

00:03:32.297 --> 00:03:33.457
If I lost you,

00:03:33.777 --> 00:03:35.256
Ms. Lu would chop me up

00:03:35.337 --> 00:03:36.656
for Mr. Changxi's meat filling.

00:03:39.985 --> 00:03:45.961
(Sweet Bamboo Dessert Shop)

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.830
This shop is still open until now.

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:57.470
You remember it?

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.470
I'd forget anyplace before here.

00:04:02.897 --> 00:04:04.368
(Ice Cream)

00:04:04.368 --> 00:04:05.728
As a child I always wondered

00:04:05.728 --> 00:04:07.368
what flavor this really was.

00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:09.009
You never tried it?

00:04:12.248 --> 00:04:13.928
This ice cream cost three yuan each.

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:16.529
Aunt couldn't bear to buy two.

00:04:17.368 --> 00:04:18.688
So every time we passed,

00:04:19.848 --> 00:04:21.649
she bought one for her daughter.

00:04:24.168 --> 00:04:25.089
Just once.

00:04:26.209 --> 00:04:27.529
Uncle took me out

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:29.368
and secretly bought me

00:04:29.368 --> 00:04:30.608
a fifty-cent popsicle.

00:04:34.608 --> 00:04:36.048
After my dad died,

00:04:36.368 --> 00:04:38.329
Aunt sold our place

00:04:39.329 --> 00:04:41.488
to fund her daughter's overseas studies.

00:04:42.608 --> 00:04:43.928
Uncle couldn't object.

00:04:45.808 --> 00:04:48.488
They wanted me
to attend vocational school

00:04:48.488 --> 00:04:49.409
and marry early.

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:51.488
So that life would be easier.

00:04:53.168 --> 00:04:54.449
If not for meeting Jiang,

00:04:58.188 --> 00:04:58.688
who knows

00:04:58.688 --> 00:05:00.569
what kind of life I'd be living now?

00:05:09.808 --> 00:05:11.209
Excuse me. May I ask something?

00:05:11.368 --> 00:05:12.728
When did the people here move?

00:05:14.248 --> 00:05:15.368
Years ago.

00:05:15.728 --> 00:05:17.009
Demolition's been talked about.

00:05:17.209 --> 00:05:18.569
Still not done to this day.

00:05:19.168 --> 00:05:21.048
Do you know where they moved to?

00:05:21.288 --> 00:05:22.409
Who knows?

00:05:23.209 --> 00:05:24.329
Each finds their own fate.

00:05:36.248 --> 00:05:36.889
How about

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:39.129
I ask the neighborhood committee?

00:05:39.329 --> 00:05:40.330
They'll surely know where

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:41.680
your uncle and aunt moved to.

00:05:42.168 --> 00:05:43.048
No need.

00:05:49.995 --> 00:05:52.881
(Peace, Joy, and All Things Auspicious;
Joy Comes Upon)

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:28.048
Don't forget today's five stars...

00:06:31.848 --> 00:06:33.209
Alright, eat first.

00:06:45.048 --> 00:06:46.209
You love this so much?

00:06:46.848 --> 00:06:47.928
Here, have some more.

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:52.409
You don't like it?

00:07:17.553 --> 00:07:19.313
(Day 10 of Yan Tuo's disappearance.)

00:07:19.512 --> 00:07:22.032
(He'll come back safely. Definitely.)

00:07:22.272 --> 00:07:23.593
I almost died in the mine,

00:07:23.593 --> 00:07:24.713
and you risked saving me.

00:07:24.713 --> 00:07:25.512
Recall anything?

00:07:25.512 --> 00:07:26.593
How often must I say it?

00:07:26.752 --> 00:07:27.632
I remember nothing.

00:08:07.504 --> 00:08:08.560
What?

00:08:09.073 --> 00:08:11.393
Uh... It's business. Work.

00:08:31.409 --> 00:08:32.409
Are you finally

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:33.970
getting it now?

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:35.730
Get to the point.

00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:38.490
Ever watch The Female Artists?

00:08:38.889 --> 00:08:41.049
That variety show blew up everywhere.

00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:43.250
They gather some female artists

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:44.730
together in a place for two weeks

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:46.009
to jointly create a work of art

00:08:46.049 --> 00:08:46.850
for later auction.

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:48.809
Doesn't matter if it sells or not.

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:50.409
The real juice is watching them feud.

00:08:50.409 --> 00:08:51.610
Absolute fireworks.

00:08:54.169 --> 00:08:55.250
Well, I'm just...

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:56.210
Are you serious?

00:08:57.490 --> 00:08:59.090
But there's no need for that anymore.

00:09:00.169 --> 00:09:00.970
Your body of work

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:02.929
deserves its own exhibition.

00:09:04.529 --> 00:09:05.090
Are you sure?

00:09:07.889 --> 00:09:09.049
W-Where did

00:09:09.049 --> 00:09:10.850
the new inspiration come from?

00:09:18.009 --> 00:09:18.649
No idea.

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:22.450
I woke up, and it just hit me.

00:09:49.872 --> 00:09:51.296
Per Xicang Meteorological Station's

00:09:51.296 --> 00:09:52.977
latest monitoring data,

00:09:52.977 --> 00:09:53.857
our city has issued

00:09:53.857 --> 00:09:55.617
a blue rainstorm warning.

00:09:55.857 --> 00:09:57.496
Extreme rainfall is expected

00:09:57.496 --> 00:09:58.776
across most districts

00:09:58.776 --> 00:10:00.977
within hours.

00:10:01.097 --> 00:10:02.577
Avoid nonessential travel.

00:10:02.577 --> 00:10:03.977
Steer clear of rivers, mountains,

00:10:03.977 --> 00:10:06.536
and areas prone
to landslide and mudslide.

00:10:07.496 --> 00:10:08.697
A couple of years back,

00:10:09.256 --> 00:10:11.057
this courtyard got flooded.

00:10:11.057 --> 00:10:12.937
Water rushed right into the house.

00:10:13.817 --> 00:10:16.176
Miss Nie and I
hauled furniture all night.

00:10:16.457 --> 00:10:17.737
Hopefully,

00:10:18.296 --> 00:10:19.697
it doesn't rain so hard this time.

00:10:22.737 --> 00:10:24.016
If furniture gets waterlogged,

00:10:24.577 --> 00:10:25.817
we can buy replacements.

00:10:27.016 --> 00:10:28.256
If the first floor floods,

00:10:28.296 --> 00:10:29.376
we can move to the second.

00:10:30.256 --> 00:10:31.496
If the second floods too,

00:10:31.496 --> 00:10:32.416
we still have the roof.

00:10:35.097 --> 00:10:35.857
Look at you.

00:10:36.536 --> 00:10:39.776
Miss Nie has really
honed your resilience.

00:10:55.176 --> 00:10:56.136
Storm's coming.

00:10:56.337 --> 00:10:57.337
Are the windows shut?

00:12:19.697 --> 00:12:20.337
Luo!

00:12:23.416 --> 00:12:24.057
Luo!

00:13:17.416 --> 00:13:18.217
Luo.

00:13:18.256 --> 00:13:19.737
Give me five.

00:13:23.617 --> 00:13:24.577
This isn't a weapon,

00:13:24.776 --> 00:13:26.817
but something helps you escape
at critical moments.

00:13:27.457 --> 00:13:28.656
It can't launch an attack.

00:13:29.697 --> 00:13:31.176
Luo!

00:14:13.896 --> 00:14:14.577
Yan Tuo?

00:14:15.536 --> 00:14:16.176
Yan Tuo?

00:14:51.297 --> 00:14:52.017
Yan Tuo.

00:14:58.777 --> 00:14:59.656
You're back?

00:15:00.337 --> 00:15:01.097
You're back.

00:15:07.216 --> 00:15:08.376
Long time no see.

00:15:54.097 --> 00:15:54.817
You're awake.

00:15:58.656 --> 00:16:00.857
Any plans for today?

00:16:04.337 --> 00:16:05.017
I was thinking

00:16:06.376 --> 00:16:07.696
about seeing my mom.

00:16:14.456 --> 00:16:15.337
Okay.

00:16:17.696 --> 00:16:18.577
I'll go with you.

00:18:17.976 --> 00:18:19.057
You're a grown-up now.

00:18:20.617 --> 00:18:21.936
Don't be a crybaby anymore.

00:18:24.017 --> 00:18:24.696
Mom.

00:18:41.057 --> 00:18:42.057
Be good, Luo.

00:18:42.456 --> 00:18:43.577
Mom.

00:18:44.176 --> 00:18:45.376
I'm really happy.

00:18:46.257 --> 00:18:46.976
Mom.

00:18:47.017 --> 00:18:47.936
I don't regret it.

00:18:48.497 --> 00:18:49.777
Mom.

00:18:50.376 --> 00:18:51.777
Mom.

00:18:53.136 --> 00:18:53.817
Be good.

00:18:54.896 --> 00:18:55.857
(Live well.)

00:18:56.537 --> 00:18:58.216
(Live the life you want.)

00:18:59.497 --> 00:19:00.136
Mom!

00:19:02.216 --> 00:19:03.136
Mom!

00:19:07.216 --> 00:19:08.136
Mom!

00:19:11.696 --> 00:19:12.777
Mom.

00:20:07.136 --> 00:20:07.896
My mom

00:20:10.216 --> 00:20:11.497
doesn't regret it.

00:20:17.392 --> 00:20:20.944
(Entrusted by All, Aid from All Sides)

00:21:17.648 --> 00:21:22.129
(Nie Jiuluo, Pei Ke)

00:21:30.737 --> 00:21:31.737
We could say

00:21:33.257 --> 00:21:34.497
it's all settled now.

00:22:06.577 --> 00:22:07.136
By the way,

00:22:07.497 --> 00:22:09.176
where is the Earth Fiend Xing Shen kept?

00:22:10.817 --> 00:22:11.376
Locust?

00:22:12.737 --> 00:22:14.737
We contacted a team of biologists.

00:22:15.057 --> 00:22:16.217
They've taken it away.

00:22:41.777 --> 00:22:43.217
No fiends in South Mountain.

00:22:47.616 --> 00:22:48.856
Peace for all living things.

00:22:51.577 --> 00:22:53.696
- No fiends in South Mountain.
- No fiends in South Mountain.

00:22:54.057 --> 00:22:56.136
- Peace for all living things.
- Peace for all living things.

00:23:06.737 --> 00:23:08.376
Come on. Careful.

00:23:08.376 --> 00:23:10.537
Careful.

00:23:10.856 --> 00:23:12.176
No peeking.

00:23:12.817 --> 00:23:13.497
- Are you ready?
- Alright.

00:23:13.497 --> 00:23:14.696
Where are we going?

00:23:14.977 --> 00:23:16.217
You'll know when we get there.

00:23:16.217 --> 00:23:17.136
We're already inside.

00:23:17.376 --> 00:23:18.896
It's fine. Just keep walking forward.

00:23:19.257 --> 00:23:20.217
Almost there.

00:23:20.537 --> 00:23:21.057
Okay.

00:23:21.817 --> 00:23:22.737
Get ready.

00:23:23.017 --> 00:23:25.096
Three, two, one.

00:23:28.537 --> 00:23:29.136
How is it?

00:23:30.704 --> 00:23:31.896
(Return Safely)

00:23:31.896 --> 00:23:33.616
I didn't know you had such skills.

00:23:34.297 --> 00:23:35.257
I can't make sculptures,

00:23:35.257 --> 00:23:36.696
but restoring them isn't a problem.

00:23:36.977 --> 00:23:38.497
Does that mean I can break things

00:23:38.497 --> 00:23:39.777
without feeling guilty?

00:23:39.777 --> 00:23:40.977
Since you can fix them all.

00:23:41.616 --> 00:23:43.537
You're someone
about to have a solo exhibition.

00:23:43.537 --> 00:23:44.856
Treasure your own work.

00:23:46.057 --> 00:23:47.136
How is the preparation?

00:23:47.977 --> 00:23:49.297
Most of it is ready,

00:23:49.456 --> 00:23:50.817
except the grand finale piece.

00:23:50.817 --> 00:23:52.057
It still needs some polishing.

00:23:53.217 --> 00:23:54.297
How about I show it to you?

00:23:54.297 --> 00:23:55.057
Give some feedback?

00:23:55.176 --> 00:23:55.696
No,

00:23:56.497 --> 00:23:58.176
let's save the surprise for last.

00:23:59.616 --> 00:24:00.337
Alright.

00:24:00.537 --> 00:24:01.896
But don't get your hopes too high.

00:24:02.217 --> 00:24:03.616
So you won't be disappointed.

00:24:03.856 --> 00:24:05.096
How could that be?

00:24:06.656 --> 00:24:07.696
Is the theme decided?

00:24:20.936 --> 00:24:21.577
Stripping?

00:24:24.777 --> 00:24:25.656
For so many years,

00:24:26.977 --> 00:24:27.737
I felt like

00:24:27.737 --> 00:24:29.577
I was trapped within a thin membrane.

00:24:30.896 --> 00:24:32.416
My relationship with this world

00:24:34.577 --> 00:24:36.656
was visible and touchable,

00:24:37.257 --> 00:24:39.096
yet always hazy and indistinct.

00:24:41.017 --> 00:24:42.616
You saved me from the Twilight Chasm.

00:24:43.696 --> 00:24:45.337
It felt like stripping that membrane.

00:24:46.096 --> 00:24:47.416
It brought me sudden clarity

00:24:47.856 --> 00:24:48.656
and sharpness.

00:24:51.057 --> 00:24:51.656
See?

00:24:51.896 --> 00:24:52.977
I told you before,

00:24:53.297 --> 00:24:55.497
(Stripping)
your work expresses rebirth.

00:24:58.017 --> 00:24:58.696
No.

00:25:02.936 --> 00:25:03.777
It's resurrection.

00:25:16.777 --> 00:25:17.537
Thank you.

00:25:19.257 --> 00:25:20.017
Thank you.

(A Sculptor's Handbook)

00:26:08.936 --> 00:26:09.936
You...

00:26:17.977 --> 00:26:19.416
What are you doing?

00:26:20.376 --> 00:26:22.656
The furniture Tuo got you
is arriving soon.

00:26:22.817 --> 00:26:23.737
Hurry up and open.

00:26:23.777 --> 00:26:24.936
We crave your dumplings.

00:26:33.257 --> 00:26:33.977
Alright.

Mr. Changxi.

00:26:44.537 --> 00:26:45.096
Mr. Changxi.

Be careful.

00:27:08.737 --> 00:27:09.257
Here?

00:27:09.257 --> 00:27:09.817
Yes.

00:27:11.235 --> 00:27:13.537
(Herbal Beef Dumplings)

00:27:13.537 --> 00:27:14.136
Here.

00:27:14.896 --> 00:27:15.817
A bit over there.

00:27:15.817 --> 00:27:16.537
Is here okay?

00:27:16.577 --> 00:27:17.537
(Health Tonic Pigeon Soup)
Yeah, no problem.

00:27:20.656 --> 00:27:21.257
Done.

00:27:21.577 --> 00:27:22.217
Okay.

00:27:26.257 --> 00:27:28.297
Isn't your writing a bit sloppy?

00:27:28.936 --> 00:27:29.904
Just make do for now.

00:27:29.904 --> 00:27:31.217
The custom ones are here soon.

00:28:49.497 --> 00:28:50.936
Look how refined this is.

00:28:51.896 --> 00:28:52.537
Oh no.

00:28:52.737 --> 00:28:54.176
I left the water for you in the car.

00:28:54.176 --> 00:28:55.017
I'll go grab it.

00:28:55.416 --> 00:28:56.176
Stop.

00:28:56.337 --> 00:28:57.257
An exhibition this big

00:28:57.257 --> 00:28:58.376
must have drinks.

00:28:58.616 --> 00:28:59.217
Let's go.

00:28:59.297 --> 00:28:59.896
True.

00:29:00.616 --> 00:29:02.817
Tuo surely stocked up plenty for Luo.

00:29:09.856 --> 00:29:11.257
Looking sharp today.

00:29:11.817 --> 00:29:12.936
I need to be presentable

00:29:13.017 --> 00:29:13.856
as a special guest.

00:29:13.856 --> 00:29:15.096
Special guest?

00:29:15.176 --> 00:29:15.936
To everyone else,

00:29:15.936 --> 00:29:17.780
we're just some distant poor relatives.

00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:19.295
Once inside, let's stay at the back.

00:29:19.295 --> 00:29:20.376
Nonsense.

00:29:20.577 --> 00:29:22.096
Art transcends status.

00:29:22.096 --> 00:29:23.577
We're a genuine family.

00:29:24.017 --> 00:29:25.497
Time to soak in some art.

00:29:31.176 --> 00:29:32.217
If Jiang saw this,

00:29:33.257 --> 00:29:34.176
he'd be thrilled.

00:29:43.096 --> 00:29:46.352
(Stripping)

00:30:09.361 --> 00:30:10.002
Miss Nie.

00:31:00.592 --> 00:31:01.648
I deserve half the credit.

00:31:01.648 --> 00:31:02.561
Half the credit.

00:31:02.622 --> 00:31:03.122
Right?

00:31:03.122 --> 00:31:04.081
Yes, half my credit.

00:31:04.302 --> 00:31:04.802
Beautiful.

00:31:04.802 --> 00:31:05.481
Congratulations.

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:07.050
Come on.

00:31:07.481 --> 00:31:08.162
Thank you.

00:31:11.322 --> 00:31:12.561
Time for group photos now.

00:31:12.561 --> 00:31:13.968
Photo session.

00:31:16.177 --> 00:31:18.288
Come on.

00:31:18.737 --> 00:31:19.696
This way, please.

00:31:20.697 --> 00:31:21.697
Press on that side.

00:31:21.817 --> 00:31:22.317
Okay.

00:31:23.498 --> 00:31:24.777
Today's theme is...

00:31:25.257 --> 00:31:25.898
Stripping.

00:31:26.297 --> 00:31:26.898
Stripping.

00:31:27.078 --> 00:31:28.817
- Yes. Stripping.
- Say cheese.

00:31:28.817 --> 00:31:30.257
One, two, three.

00:31:30.257 --> 00:31:31.898
- Cheese.
- Cheese.

00:31:39.898 --> 00:31:42.538
Though Nie Jiuluo is young,

00:31:42.978 --> 00:31:45.657
she's already entered

00:31:45.657 --> 00:31:47.297
her artistic maturity.

00:31:48.418 --> 00:31:50.137
She's endured so much lately,

00:31:50.697 --> 00:31:52.137
even grappling with inner emptiness.

00:31:52.578 --> 00:31:54.098
The depth of time and spaces

00:31:54.098 --> 00:31:54.777
she's lived

00:31:54.777 --> 00:31:56.337
transcends her peers

00:31:56.337 --> 00:31:57.737
and fellow artists alike.

00:31:59.378 --> 00:32:00.978
So you're late to recognize her.

00:32:01.018 --> 00:32:01.618
Well,

00:32:02.538 --> 00:32:03.458
actually, she...

00:32:03.458 --> 00:32:06.297
She has created
her definitive masterpiece.

00:32:07.817 --> 00:32:09.538
Both artistically and commercially,

00:32:09.538 --> 00:32:12.538
it has reached unprecedented heights.

00:32:13.217 --> 00:32:15.137
I-I'm not saying
she has no room to grow further.

00:32:16.418 --> 00:32:17.697
I-I mean...

00:32:20.697 --> 00:32:21.498
Mr. Yan.

00:32:22.297 --> 00:32:24.098
The piece she unveiled today

00:32:25.458 --> 00:32:26.578
is not just new work

00:32:27.378 --> 00:32:28.737
but also a signature piece.

00:32:30.618 --> 00:32:31.618
So that means

00:32:32.737 --> 00:32:33.458
it must be

00:32:34.578 --> 00:32:35.378
expensive.

00:32:39.337 --> 00:32:40.137
Mr. Lu,

00:32:41.058 --> 00:32:42.378
today I'm here to discuss

00:32:43.137 --> 00:32:44.337
not only that piece

00:32:45.498 --> 00:32:46.297
but also...

00:32:48.458 --> 00:32:49.737
but also all the other exhibits.

00:32:50.378 --> 00:32:51.177
I'll take them all.

00:32:51.857 --> 00:32:52.857
Next Thursday,

00:32:53.137 --> 00:32:54.458
no need to handle the takedown.

00:32:55.378 --> 00:32:56.817
I'll have all of them collected.

00:33:01.657 --> 00:33:02.618
You want them all?

00:33:03.898 --> 00:33:06.137
Clearing out the whole exhibition?

00:33:07.737 --> 00:33:08.697
Well,

00:33:09.058 --> 00:33:10.578
I can't offer a discount.

00:33:11.538 --> 00:33:13.018
Right. After all,

00:33:13.177 --> 00:33:14.737
you know artistic creation...

00:33:18.817 --> 00:33:20.098
Send me your bank details first.

00:33:25.137 --> 00:33:26.137
No rush on the contract.

00:33:37.098 --> 00:33:38.058
It's so quiet.

00:33:42.697 --> 00:33:44.018
Have you ever experienced that?

00:33:45.297 --> 00:33:46.697
At night, when trying to sleep,

00:33:46.697 --> 00:33:47.777
it seems silent.

00:33:47.938 --> 00:33:49.378
But inside your ears,

00:33:49.538 --> 00:33:51.378
there's this constant rumbling.

00:33:51.938 --> 00:33:52.777
Yes.

00:33:53.938 --> 00:33:55.378
Sometimes when I close my eyes,

00:33:55.657 --> 00:33:57.137
I see colorful patterns too.

00:34:01.697 --> 00:34:02.498
So,

00:34:03.137 --> 00:34:05.098
does true absolute silence exist?

00:34:09.938 --> 00:34:11.538
As long as you feel grounded inside,

00:34:12.018 --> 00:34:14.018
and you bring peace to those around you,

00:34:14.217 --> 00:34:15.297
that's true tranquility.

00:34:15.498 --> 00:34:16.058
Right?

00:34:18.098 --> 00:34:18.938
Just like now?

00:34:30.378 --> 00:34:31.177
If...

00:34:31.578 --> 00:34:32.817
I mean hypothetically speaking,

00:34:34.578 --> 00:34:35.618
if one day

00:34:35.857 --> 00:34:37.137
Earth Fiends reappear,

00:34:37.898 --> 00:34:38.817
what would you do?

00:34:48.618 --> 00:34:49.737
The old me

00:34:51.058 --> 00:34:53.618
would foolishly think dodging and hiding

00:34:53.857 --> 00:34:55.418
could bring peace.

00:34:56.777 --> 00:34:57.498
And now?

00:34:58.817 --> 00:34:59.697
Now,

00:35:02.458 --> 00:35:04.498
I finally have the life I want.

00:35:04.817 --> 00:35:06.578
If anyone tries to ruin it,

00:35:06.578 --> 00:35:08.098
I'll fight them tooth and nail.

00:35:12.378 --> 00:35:13.058
Alright.

00:35:14.098 --> 00:35:14.777
Then

00:35:15.538 --> 00:35:17.777
whether you're enjoying peace

00:35:18.378 --> 00:35:19.697
or fighting tooth and nail,

00:35:20.058 --> 00:35:21.418
always include me, Miss Nie.

00:35:22.337 --> 00:35:24.378
Count on it, Mr. Yan.

00:35:48.257 --> 00:35:49.217
It's worth the trip.

00:35:50.257 --> 00:35:51.378
What shall we eat later?

00:35:52.578 --> 00:35:53.498
Let's check nearby.

00:35:53.498 --> 00:35:54.217
Okay.

00:35:55.177 --> 00:35:56.217
I know a restaurant.

00:35:56.217 --> 00:35:56.938
Okay.

00:36:07.177 --> 00:36:09.018
Grandpa, everything's settled.

00:36:09.618 --> 00:36:12.058
The sculptures will be delivered
to you next Thursday.

00:36:13.018 --> 00:36:14.098
I don't need the others.

00:36:15.177 --> 00:36:16.737
Just get me that particular piece.

00:36:20.058 --> 00:36:22.177
What's so special about that piece,

00:36:22.697 --> 00:36:24.697
worth buying the entire exhibition for?

00:36:29.297 --> 00:36:30.498
It reminds me

00:36:31.777 --> 00:36:33.137
of my hometown.

00:36:36.217 --> 00:36:37.458
When you're old,

00:36:38.378 --> 00:36:40.297
you tend to get homesick.

00:37:59.652 --> 00:38:06.212
