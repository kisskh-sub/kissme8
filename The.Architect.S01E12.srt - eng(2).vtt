But you are the one
who is supposed to drink this wine,

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.640
Pei Yu.

(I can't wait to kill you
to avenge the Shen family)

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.319
Your Majesty,

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.319
I am just a civilian.

00:01:20.812 --> 00:01:23.000
Without Governor Pei to protect me,

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:24.879
I dare not compete with the princess.

00:01:25.519 --> 00:01:26.120
Everything

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:28.359
was ordered by Governor Pei.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.799
I was weak

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.359
and could only obey.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.319
I doted on you usually,

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.680
but you're getting arrogant
because of that.

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:45.480
If Your Lordship treats me heartlessly,
I will do the same to you.

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:47.280
All of this was because

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.599
you didn't want to marry Wan'er,

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.520
but you couldn't
go against the imperial decree

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.480
so you sacrificed me.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.560
Your Majesty,
don't listen to her nonsense.

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:05.519
I think a cup of poison wine isn't enough
to appease Her Highness's anger.

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:07.599
Your Majesty, please allow me

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:08.560
to take her away

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:10.439
and punish her

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:11.879
myself.

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:14.400
Hold it.

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:23.039
Pei Yu,

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.759
I have high hopes for you,

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.280
yet you can't even
manage your family matters.

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:29.879
It seems like

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.400
you haven't changed your ways

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:33.479
after the flogging last time.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.039
Someone,

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.360
bring me my Dragon Whip.

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:42.680
Carry out the punishment.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.240
Father.

00:02:56.719 --> 00:02:57.439
Stop!

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:01.400
It's all your fault.

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:03.199
Wretch! Jinx!

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.560
You caused Yu harm.

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:05.360
Get lost!

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.960
Yu,

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:16.280
are you all right?

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:17.680
See?

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:19.879
Other women only hurt you

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.840
and stab you in the back.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.879
I'm the only one who will save you.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.479
I'm the only one worthy of you.

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:31.960
We are a match made in heaven.

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:37.479
Not bad.

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:40.000
What a good act.

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:43.730
You actually made Pei Yu
get punished in public.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.120
Xi Yan,

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.719
I was right about you.

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.660
Young Lord Xiao, congratulations
on coming out of your confinement.

Very good.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.240
However,

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.280
don't forget our promise.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.520
Don't disappoint me.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.199
This is nothing much to me.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.040
It'll heal in a few days.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.399
But you got whipped

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.720
because of me.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.639

Pei Yu,

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:49.870
you seized the Shen residence

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:52.519
and annihilated the whole family.

00:09:52.799 --> 00:09:54.919
You also closed the case yourself.

00:09:56.639 --> 00:10:00.039
I admit I made some mistakes
in investigating the Shen family case.

00:10:01.039 --> 00:10:02.399
All the evidence here

00:10:03.159 --> 00:10:05.000

going against an imperial order

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.200
when I seized the residence.

00:10:18.799 --> 00:10:20.120
Why would I go through the trouble

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.639

what you've found so far.

00:10:44.399 --> 00:10:45.639

an ambiguous answer.

00:11:07.799 --> 00:11:09.159
I only believe in myself.

00:11:10.399 --> 00:11:11.759

00:11:12.587 --> 00:11:13.759

00:11:39.799 --> 00:11:41.279
I'm going to find the answer myself.

00:11:51.879 --> 00:11:53.720
Your Lordship keeps
taking care of Lady Xi Yan,

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:56.200
but she turns her back on you quickly.

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:58.110
She actually gave you
such a serious wound.

00:12:00.759 --> 00:12:02.679
I don't believe
it was just an act between us.

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:04.559
I'm sure she wants something else.

00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:07.759
Why did you...

00:12:10.639 --> 00:12:11.679
Are you trying to say

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:13.600
that I've known that she is using me

00:12:13.759 --> 00:12:14.559
and lying to me,

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.500
so why am I still indulging her?

00:12:18.399 --> 00:12:19.480
I'm just worried

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.799
that Lady Xi Yan

00:12:21.799 --> 00:12:22.519
doesn't hold back.

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.000
She might

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.399
hurt you even deeper in the future.

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:30.300
She has no one to rely on.

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:32.279
She wants to investigate

00:12:32.279 --> 00:12:33.559
the Shen family's case,

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.490
but she has no one to help her

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:36.799
and doesn't know where to start.

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.399
But you've done your best

00:12:39.639 --> 00:12:40.799
for the Shen family's case.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.120
There was solid evidence in the case.

00:12:44.759 --> 00:12:46.519
It's not that easy
to right the injustice.

00:12:47.399 --> 00:12:48.720
If we want to overturn the case,

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:51.080
we must find new evidence

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.639
to prove that the Shen family

00:12:53.759 --> 00:12:54.799
was wronged.

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.440
But the people don't care about that.

00:12:58.039 --> 00:12:58.919
They only think

00:12:58.919 --> 00:13:00.960
that you've wrongly
killed the Shen family.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:07.440
Miss.

00:13:08.559 --> 00:13:10.639
I heard the Governor
suffered a serious injury.

00:13:10.919 --> 00:13:13.120
Qin Feng used a method
to save heavily wounded soldiers

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:14.480
to stop the Governor's bleeding.

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:16.960
The truth is hidden within.

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:18.080
Everyone thinks

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:19.559
I wrongly killed the Shen family,

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:22.120
but no one will expect me

00:13:23.279 --> 00:13:24.879
to investigate the case in secret.

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:26.759
Especially Prince Duan's Residence.

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:28.360
They don't know

00:13:28.919 --> 00:13:30.159
that all the clues

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:31.519
are pointing at him.

00:13:31.919 --> 00:13:33.039
Moreover...

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:37.759
Why didn't you tell Lady Xi Yan
and let her misunderstand you instead?

00:13:41.639 --> 00:13:42.759
She didn't misunderstand me.

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:46.240
Can I really say
that the Shen family case

00:13:46.679 --> 00:13:47.960
has nothing to do with me?

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.519
Moreover, I only have clues now

00:13:50.519 --> 00:13:51.360
and no evidence.

00:13:53.799 --> 00:13:55.480
Why increase her trouble for nothing?

00:13:59.360 --> 00:13:59.919
My Lordship.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.840
In today's autumn hunt,

00:14:21.292 --> 00:14:22.365
all of you

00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:24.399
must show your true skills

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:25.679
and not slack.

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:29.890
The person who hunts the most animals will be

00:14:30.559 --> 00:14:31.840
rewarded handsomely by me.

00:14:32.799 --> 00:14:34.840
Long live Your Majesty.

00:14:36.759 --> 00:14:37.440
Stand.

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:39.279
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:14:49.639 --> 00:14:50.399
Yu,

00:14:50.639 --> 00:14:51.600
Father has allowed me

00:14:51.919 --> 00:14:53.080
to participate in this hunt

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:54.720
as the Governor's Wife.

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:01.759
This fragrance pouch helps
repel insects and dissolve poison.

00:15:02.159 --> 00:15:05.000
I'm sure it can help My Lordship
show your skills at the hunting ground.

00:15:05.799 --> 00:15:07.320
Mandarin ducks appear in pairs.

00:15:08.679 --> 00:15:10.000
Why is there only one here?

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:14.639
Obviously, the other one is with me.

00:15:18.039 --> 00:15:20.039
Then, head to
the hunting ground with me.

00:15:29.919 --> 00:15:31.039
Your embroidery looks so ugly

00:15:31.399 --> 00:15:33.440
and you want to be together with Yu?

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:35.290
Who do you think you are?

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:40.960
Your Highness,

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:43.500
everything has been arranged
according to your order.

00:15:48.325 --> 00:15:50.337
(End of Episode)

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:00.679
I've only seen it in books.

00:16:00.679 --> 00:16:01.720
