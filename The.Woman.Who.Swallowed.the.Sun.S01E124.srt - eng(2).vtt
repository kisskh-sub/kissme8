00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:04.080
(Episode 124)

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.670
Kyung Chae, are you okay?

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.780
Ms. Kyung Chae, are you going out?

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.310
I have to go to work.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.220
I have to be there.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.790
It's a critical time,
so I can't be away from the office.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.890
Se Ri, stay home quietly
and don't cause any trouble.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.030
Are you sure you're okay?

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.930
Do you remember what happened yesterday?

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.470
Nothing happened yesterday.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.930
We just came home from the office.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:04.800
I'm heading out.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.010
I don't think she remembers at all.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.650
That's probably for the best.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.720
It can't be undone anyway.
What's the use of remembering?

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.920
It will just drive her crazy.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:23.460
But still...

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.660
Mi So is her daughter.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.160
Don't even say such things.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.990
It was just a terrible twist of fate
that brought them together.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.300
You're the only daughter
Ms. Kyung Chae has.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.370
So you must never abandon Ms. Kyung Chae,
no matter what happens.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.640
Why would I ever abandon her?

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.110
She practically raised me.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.880
That's why I'm telling you
to never see that woman again.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.310
Don't even think about her.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.910
How can I not? She's my birth mother.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.550
I don't even know what to do right now.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.630
This is all my fault.

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.100
(Mingang Distribution)

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.240
What's the situation with the directors?

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.410
Did you tell them I asked for a meeting?

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.440
They're quick on the uptake,

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.540
so it seems like
they're deliberately laying low.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.550
I thought you were gathering them
in the conference room.

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.120
Do whatever it takes to gather
the directors and make it happen.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.320
Or else you're finished, too.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.960
Your fate will be no different
from theirs.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.060
I thought we agreed
for me to look the other way...

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.290
on you embezzling the slush fund.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.960
I also said it would be my last request.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.830
From where I'm standing,
this doesn't feel like a request.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.470
Request or not, just do as you're told.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.010
You will power trip over me
until the very end?

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.780
These entitled owners just don't know
what situation they're in.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.110
They're in no position
to be making demands.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.120
So you think she really can't remember
what happened?

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.220
Yes.

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.690
I'm worried she's going to lose her mind.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.930
No, that won't happen.

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.290
It's a natural reaction to the trauma.

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.230
What happened to Mi So is a huge shock
from her perspective.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.900
That's all it is.
She'll be fine, so don't worry.

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.410
To be honest,

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:23.610
I'm more worried about you right now.

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.610
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:26.780
You...

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:28.650
Are you okay?

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:30.620
Se Ri...

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:32.880
If you're struggling,

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.720
it's okay to admit it.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.700
To be honest, I am struggling.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.770
It's so hard that I wish
I could turn back time 20 years.

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.840
If Mi So and I
were never switched at birth,

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.440
I would have lived with you all along,

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.780
even if life was hard and we were poor,
I think I would've been happy.

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.820
Then that accident with Mi So
never would have happened.

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:16.690
I'm so sorry.

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:20.670
I'm so sorry, Se Ri.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:21.900
I...

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.070
I'm so sorry I couldn't raise you.

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.280
No, it's not your fault.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.140
And it's not Kyung Chae's fault either.

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.520
It's just that things somehow
ended up this way.

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.390
So you don't have to apologize to me.

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:48.660
My sweet girl...

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:22.820
My goodness! Father, you're walking now?

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.090
It looks like your paralyzed mouth
is back in action!

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:29.790
Chairman!

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:33.630
You're walking.

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:36.070
Weren't you the one telling me
to hurry up and recover?

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:39.400
You said I needed to support Kyung Chae
to save the company.

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:41.070
Of course I did.

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:44.640
Ms. Kyung Chae is going through
so much as it is,

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.010
so this is wonderful news, Chairman.

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:49.480
I'll be going into the office
starting tomorrow.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.580
I need to see for myself
what's been going on.

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:59.660
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:01.860
Mom.

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:05.300
It's me, your daughter, Mi So.

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:12.400
I'm your daughter,

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:14.610
so why are you pretending
you don't know me?

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:18.180
Why are you doing this to me?

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:21.010
Stop it.

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:22.850
Stop it, Mi So.

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:25.950
This isn't going to change anything.

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:28.520
Even if I admit you're my daughter,

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:31.060
it's not like you'll come back to life.

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:34.760
So please, just leave me alone.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.560
Please, just let me go on
living like this.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.730
I can't take this anymore.

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:42.930
So please, don't do this.

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:45.900
I told you to stop!

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:54.250
(Mingang Distribution)

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:32.450
Mom.

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:47.130
Stop it.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:49.970
I said to stop!

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:53.770
Please, just stop. Okay?

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:56.340
Please, Mi So.

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:02.780
I didn’t do that to you on purpose.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.620
I didn't even know you were my daughter.

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:08.220
I wouldn't have done it if I'd known.

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:10.860
So please, just leave.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.190
Get away from me!

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:16.930
If you keep haunting me like this,

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:19.200
I'll truly come to loathe you.

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.540
I had no other choice.

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:30.840
Back then,
I thought Se Ri was my daughter.

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.210
There was no other way to protect her.

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:37.920
I was just protecting my daughter.

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:39.920
I wasn't trying to ruin you.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:42.590
I was just protecting my daughter.

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:44.860
So please, stop this.

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:47.290
Stop following me around.

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:55.670
Look, I'm begging you, okay?

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:57.200
Mi So...

00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:59.100
I'm begging you.

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:02.340
Then, will you finally stop?

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:17.120
What's wrong with you?

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:19.560
Snap out of it!

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:22.860
What Mi So wants...

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:25.660
isn't to see her mother on her knees.

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:27.900
Don't you get it?

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:30.100
How can you be her mother...

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:33.970
if you don't know
what your daughter wants?

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:37.010
That's right, I don't.

00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:39.910
How could I possibly know?

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:45.320
I never even got to hold her in my arms.
How would I know?

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:48.990
I never even looked into her eyes.
How would I know?

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:52.690
I never even held her hand.

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:56.330
We never exchanged a single word.
How would I know?

00:10:56.660 --> 00:11:01.570
I didn't even know she existed,
so how would I know?

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.840
But at least you got to be a mother.

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:12.240
You were a mother to Mi So and to Se Ri.

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.950
You got to hear them call you "Mom."

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.020
So how can you say we're the same?

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:21.850
Why do you always act like
we're in the same boat?

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:24.920
When you...

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:27.860
see Mi So in your dreams,
you're happy, aren't you?

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:31.400
When you hear her voice in your sleep,
you feel happy, don't you?

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.870
But it's not like that for me.

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:37.940
When Mi So appears in my dreams,

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:39.970
I'm terrified.

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:42.270
When I close my eyes,

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:46.040
I think I can hear her voice,
and I start shaking all over.

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:50.550
It feels like a vengeful ghost
is latched onto me,

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:52.120
and it gives me the creeps.

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:55.650
How can you say that
about your own daughter?

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.420
How can you think she's a vengeful spirit?

00:11:58.620 --> 00:11:59.990
To me, she is.

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:02.990
I'm terrified she's going to devour me.

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:05.400
I'm scared she's come to take me away.

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:06.530
So...

00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:09.600
don't you dare tell me to accept her.

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:11.400
To me, she's...

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:14.140
nothing more than a vengeful spirit.

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:33.660
A vengeful spirit?

00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:35.990
What is wrong with her?

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:40.160
Seriously, how can a mother
say that about her own daughter?

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:42.270
If she destroyed her child,

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:44.200
she should act like she's a sinner,
kneeling and begging,

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:45.340
which still wouldn't be enough.

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:48.570
I think it's because of the guilt.

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.470
The things she did for Se Ri...

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:52.840
are what ended up killing Mi So.

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:56.250
That's true. To save Se Ri,
who isn't even her real daughter,

00:12:56.450 --> 00:12:59.080
she sacrificed her real daughter, Mi So.

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:01.290
No wonder she's losing her mind.

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:04.020
But still, calling her a vengeful spirit?

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:06.860
Imagine how heartbroken Mi So would be
if she heard that.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:11.460
Anyway, what's the latest
with the board of directors?

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:14.370
Kim Sun Jae hasn't made
any significant moves yet.

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:17.270
The directors are sharp and know
which way the wind is blowing,

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:20.370
so it seems they're making excuses
to avoid calling a meeting.

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:21.510
In that case,

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:23.870
why don't we make the first move?

00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:25.580
We should make the first move?

00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:27.480
Their play is obvious, isn't it?

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:30.310
If we beat them to the punch
with a different strategy,

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:32.780
I think we'll have a shot.

00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:35.550
A different approach to sway the board?

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:39.760
I'll meet
with all of the directors personally.

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:44.090
If they use the stick,
we'll offer the carrot.

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:45.760
Won't that be enough
to make them switch sides?

00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:57.980
Welcome home.

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.210
The chairman has been waiting for you.

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:19.830
Father.

00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:21.530
I'm back on my own two feet.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.530
Do you know what this means?

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:27.740
It means I have to go back to Mingang,
take out the trash...

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:30.040
and protect our company.
It's a sign from above, isn't it?

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:34.510
What's wrong?

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:36.780
What is it? Why the long face?

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:40.750
- Father.
- Tell me.

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:44.220
You can tell me anything. Spit it out.

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:45.760
The thing is...

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:48.930
Se Ri...

00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:58.100
So in the end,
Lucia is the root of all this.

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:02.010
Even if the babies were switched,
how could it be with someone like her?

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:06.010
So you're saying Se Ri
is Lucia's flesh and blood, right?

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:07.850
I should just...

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:10.280
Se Ri is my daughter.

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:13.550
She's not that woman's child.
She is my daughter.

00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:16.650
I raised her through everything.

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:20.190
And now, she's that woman's daughter?
Does that even make sense?

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:21.560
Exactly my point.

00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:24.060
You raised her through everything.

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:26.030
Are you just going to stand there...

00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:28.230
while that witch takes
the child you raised?

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:30.430
Your dead daughter is gone.

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:32.340
You need to focus on
the one who's still alive.

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:34.270
What?

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:36.310
And it's the same with the company.

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:39.740
Mingang Distribution is stained
with your daughter's blood.

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:42.050
Mi So, was it?

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:45.150
She doesn't have a single drop
of Lucia's blood in her.

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:46.720
She was your flesh and blood.

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:49.520
She was the child
you went through labor to have.

00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:51.960
Are you going to let that witch...

00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:53.790
take away a company stained
with your child's blood?

00:15:57.390 --> 00:15:59.430
Then pull yourself together
and protect what's yours!

00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:00.930
Both Se Ri and the company.

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:02.630
Do you understand me?

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:04.440
Yes.

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:12.740
I heard everything from Ms. Se Ri.

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:15.110
How could this have happened?

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:17.750
I was wondering why
you were acting so strange.

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:21.050
I'm fine. Please just look after Se Ri.

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:24.390
After hearing what my father said,
I realized he was right.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:28.690
Mingang Distribution is stained
with my daughter's blood.

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:31.300
And I'm supposed to just let her take it?

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:33.800
Exactly. You're absolutely right.

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:36.070
You have to protect it, no matter what.

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:43.340
(Mingang Distribution)

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:47.380
What do you think Madam Jang meant
by offering the directors a carrot?

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:50.650
Min Kyung Chae will obviously try
to threaten the directors,

00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:53.450
so she'll probably offer them
something completely different.

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:55.320
Besides, they're the ones...

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:56.920
with the most complaints
about the company.

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:05.900
Why are you so shocked?

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:11.100
Are you two putting your heads together,
plotting to steal Mingang Distribution?

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:13.400
You should all be struck by lightning.

00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:17.410
- Chairman.
- Don't you "Chairman" me.

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:21.780
How long has it been
since you destroyed our family and left?

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:24.980
You're not even bothering
to hide it anymore.

00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:27.890
You're just sitting here,
scheming to steal my company.

00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:29.950
Since you brought it up, shall we?

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:32.360
The roots of Mingang Distribution.

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:35.360
It was my late father's company,
Doeun Industries, wasn't it?

00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:37.490
Thirty years ago,

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:40.060
you stole the company from my father.

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:42.170
That's how Mingang was born.

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:44.330
Look at you, running your mouth.

00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:46.470
Is that what your father taught you?

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:50.010
To sneak into someone's company like a rat
and plot to steal it?

00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:51.340
Shut your mouth!

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:55.110
Tae Kyung doesn't deserve
to hear that from you.

00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:57.650
As bad as he is, you're even worse!

00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:01.080
You forged his father's contract,
tricked me,

00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:03.090
and stole my shares?

00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:05.660
Why, you...

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:15.700
What do you think you're doing?

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:17.070
We're not the kind of people...

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:19.200
who will let you hit us
or walk all over us.

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:21.510
Do not be so reckless and disrespectful.

00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:23.670
You don't have that right.

00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:26.680
The owner family? A royal family?

00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:29.810
That won't last much longer, Chairman.

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:31.820
Why, you...

00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:36.520
Do you really think
you can get away with this?

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:38.520
Get out now!

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:46.800
They still don't get it.

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:51.970
No, maybe they'll never
understand a thing.

00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:54.540
Then we'll have to force them to.

00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:56.910
I don't think there's any reason
to wait anymore.

00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:59.280
Madam Jang needs
to contact the directors...

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:02.480
and get a board resolution
to call a shareholders' meeting.

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:13.060
Ji Seop. Why are you calling?

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:14.390
Is my father-in-law there with you?

00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:18.000
He said he was coming to the office today,
but I haven't been able to reach him.

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:19.430
My husband?

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:22.530
I don't know what's up,
but he's been in his room all day.

00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:24.230
Is he not feeling well?

00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:25.800
Sick? Please.

00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:29.040
He ate a huge breakfast
and even had snacks this morning.

00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:32.780
All right, I got it.

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:37.010
Honey! Pan Sool!

00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:40.350
My goodness.

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:43.450
My goodness.

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:46.390
Honey, come on, get up.

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:53.160
If you're going to hand over those shares,
just do it already.

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:54.360
They're waiting.

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:56.230
My goodness.

00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:58.100
Wait a minute.

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:01.240
That's the look you get
when you've done something wrong.

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:05.880
You really sold all your shares,
didn't you?

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:08.150
My one and only love, Mal Sook.

00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:09.650
You see, the thing is...

00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:13.480
Back then,
Ms. Stella told me to hand them over,

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:15.090
so I gave her...

00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:17.750
All of it?

00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:21.330
I don't remember giving them to her.
I'm positive I didn't.

00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:22.690
But they just got transferred.

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:25.260
But I made a good chunk of change.

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:27.200
You absolute fool!

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:30.430
Who cares about the money?
Do you think our in-laws need the money?

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:32.400
They need every last share they can get!

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.270
That's the only way
they can save the company!

00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:35.670
You fool!

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:38.080
You fell for that old vixen
and let her take you for everything!

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:39.510
Just brilliant!

00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:40.680
Now what are you going to do?

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:44.150
What are you going to do
when Ji Seop has complete faith in you?

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:46.920
I have nothing to say for myself.

00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:49.050
I'll take whatever punishment you give me.

00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:50.850
Just please don't headbutt me.

00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:57.460
I deserve to have my head smashed in!
I deserve it!

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:00.600
I'd deserve it
even if I were bleeding everywhere.

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:02.770
My point is,

00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:05.740
I want to hear
what the directors have to say.

00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:10.010
Yes, fine. Let's do that.
I'll see you in the conference room.

00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:13.480
These guys are unbelievable.

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:20.820
When are the directors supposed to gather?

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:22.590
They'll be in the conference room shortly.

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:25.860
Since when did they get so gutsy?

00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:29.530
I summon them as the CEO,
and they take this long to show up?

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:32.730
Tell me about it.
They've been giving me the runaround.

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:35.500
Today, the directors
all went out together,

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:36.600
so I couldn't reach them all day.

00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:38.100
I just now managed to get a hold of them.

00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:40.370
What's gotten into them?

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.440
I need them for now, so I'll let it slide,

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:45.640
but once they've served their purpose,
I'll just clean house.

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:47.980
Replacements are a dime a dozen.

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:52.980
(Mingang Distribution)

00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:00.620
I'll get straight to the point.

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:03.590
Soon, the Acting Chairman
will convene a board meeting...

00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:06.430
and formally request
to hold a shareholders' meeting.

00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:09.700
A shareholders' meeting?
Why all of a sudden?

00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:12.200
Has something urgent come up?

00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:15.070
She intends to oust the current chairman,
Min Doo Sik,

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:17.270
and take his seat for herself.

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:19.910
Not as Acting Chairman,
but as the official one.

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:26.020
You directors will not
let her get her way.

00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:29.420
Is that a request?

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:32.960
You seem to have misunderstood.

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:34.890
This isn't a request.

00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:35.990
It's an order.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.300
All right.

00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:49.910
Director Kim, your daughter,
who's currently studying abroad,

00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:52.540
seems to be in a bit of trouble.

00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:56.880
And Director Park, your second son...

00:22:57.450 --> 00:22:58.450
is in some hot water as well.

00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:01.450
Gosh.

00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:03.720
Director Jung, the issue
with your precious daughter is...

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:05.120
no small matter either.

00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:10.790
And finally, for the grand finale,
Director Oh's twins.

00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:14.200
I guess because they're twins,

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:16.070
they're double the trouble.

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:21.300
Absolutely do not let that woman
take the chairmanship.

00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:23.540
This board will block
the shareholders' meeting.

00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:25.910
Do I make myself clear?

00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:26.940
Are you...

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:30.210
threatening us,

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:31.880
using our children?

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:33.850
What else would you call it?

00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:37.290
If you don't want
your kids' dirty laundry aired in public,

00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:38.590
you know what to do.

00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:43.060
(Mingang Distribution)

00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:44.490
I'm afraid we can't do that.

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:50.930
The board of directors has resolved
to dismiss Chairman Min Doo Sik...

00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:53.240
and to appoint Jung Lucia
as the new chairman.

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:55.710
Furthermore, we will convene
a shareholders' meeting...

00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:57.970
to report the resolutions
made by this board,

00:23:57.970 --> 00:24:00.180
and they will be approved,
barring any unforeseen circumstances.

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:01.880
Also,

00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:03.650
CEO Min Kyung Chae,

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:06.150
Director Min Soo Jung,
and Vice Director Min Ji Seop...

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:09.390
will all be dismissed from their positions
as the new chairman wishes.

00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:12.260
What did you just say?

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:14.660
Are you out of your mind?

00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:18.300
I have all of this on you.

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:20.800
Do you want to see
your kids' lives ruined?

00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:22.830
If your child is precious to you,

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:25.300
you should know that others feel
the same way about theirs.

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:28.810
Especially you,
a woman with a secret child of her own.

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:31.140
As one parent to another, how could you?

00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:33.540
You've completely lost it.

00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:35.780
Are you trying to get fired?

00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:37.550
Is that why you're doing this?

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:39.050
Should I fire you?

00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:40.780
There's no need to be so classless!

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:44.490
As for my children
and the mistakes they made,

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:46.690
I'll make sure they face the consequences
for all of it.

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:49.160
I suggest you do the same.

00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:51.490
If you've done something wrong,
you deserve to be punished.

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:54.030
The problems start when you try to run
from the consequences.

00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:55.670
(Mingang Distribution)

00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:56.730
Let's go.

00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:37.310
How could you be so incompetent?

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:40.240
You messed up this badly,
and you expect a reward?

00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:44.010
You're going to pay for embezzling
the chairman's slush fund...

00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:45.950
and making secret ledgers!

00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:53.960
For goodness' sake.

00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:57.390
Baek Sul Hee,
what in the world did you do?

00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:01.300
How did she get those sly old foxes
on the board to eat out of her hand?

00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:04.170
I never expected she'd have that in her.

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:09.840
What?

00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:12.210
The board of directors said what?

00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:15.010
What were you doing?

00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:17.550
How could you let them backstab you?

00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:19.020
I did everything right.

00:26:19.450 --> 00:26:21.550
The way you taught me, like always.

00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:23.120
This is what you call "doing it right?"

00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:26.120
Go get Lucia and Moon Tae Kyung right now.

00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:29.730
No, never mind. Don't bother.

00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:44.980
I turned over Chairman Min's
slush fund ledger to the prosecutors...

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:46.710
You jerk!

00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:50.180
What did you do to the directors
to make them raise all this nonsense?

00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:52.180
Let go of me.

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:55.490
So this is how you'll avenge your father?

00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:57.250
This is it, is it?

00:26:57.520 --> 00:26:59.560
Then you should've lived an honest life.

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:01.960
You should have lived
like a decent human being.

00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:06.160
My gosh! Father, are you okay?

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:09.230
Did you just push my father?

00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:11.770
How dare you lay a hand
on Chairman Min Doo Sik?

00:27:16.570 --> 00:27:18.510
We're from the violent crimes unit
at Bohan Police Station.

00:27:19.210 --> 00:27:20.210
Min Doo Sik.

00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:22.480
You're under arrest for the murders...

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:24.750
of Han Kyung Soo, Yoon Hee Jeong,
and Jo Pil Doo.

00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:27.950
Who do you think you are?

00:27:28.650 --> 00:27:31.290
What do you think you're doing?
Do you have any idea who he is?

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:33.320
Do you know who I am?

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:35.760
I'm Min Doo Sik, the founder
of Mingang Distribution!

00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:37.130
The godfather
of the distribution industry!

00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:39.060
I even received
a presidential commendation!

00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:40.130
Take him.

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:42.430
Get your hands off me!

00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:43.970
I said, let go!

00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:45.300
What do you think you're doing?

00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:46.800
Father!

00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:07.490
