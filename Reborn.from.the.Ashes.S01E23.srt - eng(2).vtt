[Reborn from the Ashes]

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.440
[Episode 23]

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.670
Su Feiyi, you killed Wang Cuihua.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.120
I want you to pay with your life.

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:31.270
Killed who?

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:32.960
Pay with what life?

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.710
I was just playing around
with your maid.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.070
I even spared her life.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.040
Wen Yueqian,

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.000
even your maid knows you're a fake.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.270
But she really was loyal to you.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.040
I pulled out her nails,

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.040
and slashed her face,

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.880
yet she refused to betray you.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.230
You have no idea

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.230
that last night, the way she twisted
and struggled on the floor

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.670
was almost exactly the same
as you did back then.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:11.360
And,

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.670
the one who truly caused her death
wasn't me.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:15.550
It was you.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:23.590
Stop right there.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.070
Your Highness, please save me!

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.230
Qingran is trying to kill me!

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.550
What's going on here?

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:34.480
Reporting,

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.880
Su Feiyi has killed my personal maid.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.980
The manner of death was extremely cruel.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.590
Shouldn't I question her about this?

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.150
Your Highness, I did not do it.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.400
Her maid caused all the trouble.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.150
Some enemies broke into the house.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.000
Why are you wrongfully accusing me

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.270
for no reason?

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.880
Qingran, do you have any proof?

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.550
If there is no evidence,

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.630
then why did you hit my concubine?

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:00.520
Someone!

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.040
Take her to the wing room
for reflection.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:07.320
Father,

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.630
why are you getting involved
in women's affairs?

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.110
Besides, Qingran was only
teaching her sister a lesson.

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:14.960
What's wrong with that?

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:16.440
Enough.

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.400
Keep a close eye on your wife.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.590
Don't let her act recklessly again.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.800
Your Highness,

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.270
I am carrying your child.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.670
After her actions,

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.270
my stomach hurts badly.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.590
Feiyi, are you alright?

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.150
Get up quickly.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.590
Su Qingran,

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.480
you plotted against His Highness's heir.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.780
What punishment do you deserve?

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.960
Kneel down.

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.320
Su Qingran conspired against my heir.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.630
Hit her 20 times with a cane.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:00.110
Yes.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.840
Qingran is weak.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.400
I'll take the punishment

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.320
for her.

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.800
Jin, you really care for Qingran.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.520
She is my wife.

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.360
If I don't care for her,

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:24.630
should I be caring for you instead?

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.550
Since you're taking her place,

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.230
the punishment must be doubled.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:29.630
Sure.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.550
Your Highness.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.270
Just do it.

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:35.270
Yes.

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:44.840
Hit him hard.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.530

That evil spawn

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.270
must be done away with!

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.590
Am I being too impulsive?

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:41.400
When someone close is treated like that,

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.000
if you weren't impulsive,

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.110
you wouldn't be Su Qingran.

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.710
I will make Su Feiyi pay for this.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.270
Your Highness,

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.760
what are you working on this time?

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.210
This bottle contains a deadly poison.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.320
Be sure not to touch it.

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.920
You!

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.360
What are you doing with this?

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:32.960
Of course, it's to poison bad people.

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.270
To poison bad people?

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:36.670
Poison bad people.

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.920
I never thought my first use of poison

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.480
wouldn't be against an enemy.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.750
This isn't your fault.

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:56.550
You're actually helping her.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.040
I know.

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:01.800
Nanny Wang's death hit you hard.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.630
But she wouldn't want you
to stay sad forever.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000
You know what?

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.440
When I was little,
the blind fortune teller read my fate.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.550
He said my family ties were weak.

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:15.230
I never believed it.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.440
But now, it seems

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.800
it might be true.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.800
Why do all the people who are good to me

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.550
leave me one by one?

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:27.270
You still have me.

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:28.670
I have a tough fate.

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:30.800
You won't cause death to me.

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:32.750
I mean it.

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.110
When I was two years old,
my mother passed away.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.000
Later, at the age of ten,
I joined the Qilin Army with my father.

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:44.230
You also know what happened
to the Qilin Army.

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:03.840
Have a drink with me.

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:08.480
Auntie Su,

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:11.000
you are carrying a child.

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:12.480
You must not drink alcohol.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.800
The fetus in my womb

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.150
is false.

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:35.670
Are you insane?

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:37.980
You dare lie about something like this?

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:41.520
It doesn't matter if it's false now,

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:44.750
as long as it's true later.
