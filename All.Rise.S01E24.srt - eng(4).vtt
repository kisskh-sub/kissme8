(Talent Hunt Program Day 90)

00:01:50.056 --> 00:01:53.736
(Guo Xiaoyu 2, Ren Jiatong 1,
Jiang Chen 1)

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.421
The evidence from the police

00:02:04.421 --> 00:02:05.100
has been sent.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:06.540
Okay, got it.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.900
They've leaked another story.

00:02:28.541 --> 00:02:30.101
They're claiming that years ago,

00:02:30.101 --> 00:02:30.940
Ms. Bai drove a man

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.740
named Ren Ping to suicide
in the same way.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.620
Now, his widow is demanding justice.

00:02:35.141 --> 00:02:36.101
Ren Ping's widow?

00:02:41.421 --> 00:02:42.024
Mom!

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.500
What's going on?

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.620
Why did you
make those public statements?

00:02:46.101 --> 00:02:47.500
I'm working with this team!

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.780
How can I possibly stay now?

00:02:48.981 --> 00:02:49.940
Then leave the team.

00:02:50.381 --> 00:02:51.021
Mom!

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.848
Jiatong!

00:02:52.581 --> 00:02:54.861
I know how desperately
you want to be a lawyer.

00:02:55.421 --> 00:02:57.060
I can't help you.

00:02:57.581 --> 00:02:58.900
And I always hold you back.

00:02:59.301 --> 00:03:00.740
But why did you tell Bai Xiao

00:03:01.141 --> 00:03:02.340
about your father?

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:03.900
Will she keep you after that?

00:03:05.101 --> 00:03:06.180
What you're doing now

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.141
is cleaning up someone else's mess!

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.220
No matter what I tell you,

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.381
you don't believe me, do you?

00:03:14.141 --> 00:03:15.180
Listen to me.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.301
You're just like your dad,

00:03:16.581 --> 00:03:17.660
too kind-hearted.

00:03:18.021 --> 00:03:19.180
You're easily fooled.

00:03:19.861 --> 00:03:21.340
Your father's case lawyer

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:22.581
promised me

00:03:22.981 --> 00:03:24.460
that he could get you a job

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.500
and ensure you remain a lawyer.

00:03:27.141 --> 00:03:27.821
So,

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:29.701
whatever he asks me to do,

00:03:30.021 --> 00:03:30.981
I'll fight

00:03:31.541 --> 00:03:32.900
to get this opportunity for you.

00:03:33.381 --> 00:03:35.301
So he's the one who made you go public?

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.460
He told you to slander Ms. Bai?

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.861
Why didn't you tell me?

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:41.660
If I told you,

00:03:41.981 --> 00:03:43.701
would you agree?

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.981
That's why I had to play the villain.

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:47.900
As long as you get what you want,

00:03:48.261 --> 00:03:49.064
it'll be worth it.

00:03:49.261 --> 00:03:50.301
I don't want it!

00:03:51.101 --> 00:03:52.780
I only want what I choose for myself!

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.460
I reject what you're forcing on me!

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.101
Why are you so stubborn?

00:03:58.141 --> 00:04:01.101
Whether you want it or not,
you should secure it first.

00:04:01.301 --> 00:04:02.021
Trust me.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.060
So after my dad died,

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.981
you immediately married Mr. Lin, right?

00:04:07.861 --> 00:04:08.424
Yes.

00:04:09.141 --> 00:04:10.060
That's who I am!

00:04:10.541 --> 00:04:12.141
You and your dad are both rigid.

00:04:12.541 --> 00:04:13.381
Back then,

00:04:13.581 --> 00:04:15.021
after your dad met with that lawyer,

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:16.821
he called and told me he would

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.980
pay compensation.

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:19.821
Why should our family pay?

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:21.860
I told him

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:22.860
I'd rather divorce

00:04:23.061 --> 00:04:24.460
than let him squander our money!

00:04:24.821 --> 00:04:26.381
I couldn't allow him to pay it all!

00:04:27.181 --> 00:04:27.944
Mom.

00:04:29.941 --> 00:04:31.141
You just said

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.220
that after my dad met Ms. Bai,

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.261
he called you?

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.780
You told him you wanted a divorce

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.261
to protect our money?

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.656
So my dad didn't have a sudden
heart attack after meeting Ms. Bai?

00:04:44.501 --> 00:04:46.021
It was after your call.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.420
I've never worked a day in my life,

00:05:04.021 --> 00:05:04.980
relying on your dad

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:06.061
and you!

00:05:06.741 --> 00:05:07.381
I know

00:05:08.061 --> 00:05:09.460
you probably look down on me too.

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.860
So what?

00:05:12.581 --> 00:05:13.821
My conscience is clear!

00:05:14.381 --> 00:05:15.780
I've done my absolute best

00:05:16.501 --> 00:05:17.220
to protect you

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:18.741
and this family!

00:05:19.141 --> 00:05:20.381
When your dad got into trouble,

00:05:20.581 --> 00:05:22.581
all I could think about was money.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.021
You and your dad are both idealists.

00:05:25.701 --> 00:05:27.540
Even as idealists,

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.061
you still need to eat!

00:05:29.581 --> 00:05:30.340
Without money,

00:05:30.701 --> 00:05:31.621
how do you eat?

00:05:32.141 --> 00:05:34.061
How could I pay for your college

00:05:34.061 --> 00:05:35.141
and the best education?

00:05:35.701 --> 00:05:37.384
The substandard construction materials

00:05:38.181 --> 00:05:39.780
were forced upon your dad!

00:05:40.381 --> 00:05:42.540
He didn't make a single dirty penny!

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.780
When the accident happened,
he had to pay.

00:05:45.181 --> 00:05:46.261
That's his moral duty.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.980
If he didn't pay,
no one would criticize him.

00:05:49.821 --> 00:05:51.980
But your dad insisted on
bankrupting himself to pay.

00:05:52.501 --> 00:05:53.381
He took it alone,

00:05:54.021 --> 00:05:55.900
yet he dragged you into it too.

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:57.181
Why?

00:05:58.821 --> 00:05:59.621
(I'm your mother.)

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:02.581
(I can't watch you)

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:04.621
(bear this burden.)

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:06.420
I need to protect you.

00:06:06.621 --> 00:06:07.860
I must protect you.

00:06:10.381 --> 00:06:10.980
I know

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:13.741
you've always hated me for marrying Lin.

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:16.340
Ever since then,

00:06:19.181 --> 00:06:20.616
you've distanced yourself from me.

00:06:24.501 --> 00:06:25.941
Lin is a good man.

00:06:26.701 --> 00:06:27.860
I just wanted to find someone

00:06:29.021 --> 00:06:30.261
to live a stable life with.

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:33.860
A steady life.

00:06:34.061 --> 00:06:35.220
Was I wrong?

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:02.780
I discovered this rooftop.

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:04.488
You need to pay to be here.

00:07:07.181 --> 00:07:07.912
Name your price.

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:09.821
100 per hour.

00:07:10.941 --> 00:07:12.424
Given our relationship?

00:07:12.941 --> 00:07:14.504
If we're not close, it'd be even more.

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:15.780
200 per hour.

00:07:17.621 --> 00:07:19.460
I think you're price gouging.

00:07:19.621 --> 00:07:21.581
I'll call 12315 to report you.

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:27.701
I know you must be sad right now.

00:07:28.776 --> 00:07:30.100
I couldn't find you anywhere.

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:31.460
I figured you'd be on the rooftop.

00:07:32.741 --> 00:07:34.261
I don't know how to face Ms. Bai.

00:07:37.941 --> 00:07:39.220
Ms. Bai wouldn't blame you.

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:41.261
Just explain everything
to her in person.

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:43.821
Explaining won't help.

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:45.900
I know she won't

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:47.300
get angry at me over this.

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:49.300
That's why I feel so awful.

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:53.300
But I need to come up with a solution.

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:57.621
That's why you came up here.

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:00.340
In that case, you are

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:01.501
as resilient as Ms. Bai.

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:05.900
Actually, I'm not.

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:08.261
I still feel sad.

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:13.340
Smile.

00:08:19.021 --> 00:08:20.300
Tell me what happened.

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:28.980
Lawyer Wang approached my mom

00:08:29.821 --> 00:08:31.581
and offered her tempting terms.

00:08:32.261 --> 00:08:33.021
He told her

00:08:33.341 --> 00:08:33.981
he could give me

00:08:33.981 --> 00:08:35.101
a highly lucrative offer.

00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:36.341
So she wavered.

00:08:36.861 --> 00:08:37.940
Mr. Song once said

00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:38.820
that lawyers

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:40.741
excel at exploiting people's desires,

00:08:41.981 --> 00:08:43.820
combining threats with incentives

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:45.021
to achieve their goals.

00:08:45.501 --> 00:08:46.221
I'm certain

00:08:46.861 --> 00:08:49.180
that persuading your mom
with your future prospects

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:50.861
would easily work.

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:52.700
Any parent cares about children.

00:08:53.341 --> 00:08:54.981
Moreover, she didn't know the truth.

00:08:54.981 --> 00:08:55.528
Yes,

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:56.780
she did know.

00:08:58.780 --> 00:08:59.700
She told me

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:01.900
that Ms. Bai didn't
cause my dad's death.

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:04.300
She did it herself.

00:09:05.861 --> 00:09:07.341
It feels surreal.

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:09.580
Part of me wants to blame her.

00:09:10.981 --> 00:09:12.820
But I have the least right to judge.

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:15.180
When she divorced my dad,

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:17.300
it was to protect assets, for my sake.

00:09:18.341 --> 00:09:19.501
Yet it cost my dad's life.

00:09:20.461 --> 00:09:22.261
Now, she agreed to slander Ms. Bai

00:09:22.261 --> 00:09:23.221
for my sake again.

00:09:24.101 --> 00:09:25.341
It hurts Ms. Bai.

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:29.101
Well,

00:09:29.101 --> 00:09:30.900
I desperately want
to break free from this.

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:33.820
I want to think calmly like a lawyer,

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:36.700
analyze and solve problems rationally.

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:39.300
But everything she did was for me.

00:09:40.341 --> 00:09:41.221
Because she loves me.

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:42.940
Though she never asks me

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:44.060
if I even need this.

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:45.900
You should talk to her.

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:48.420
As you said,

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:49.700
communication resolves problems.

00:09:50.461 --> 00:09:51.700
Since we can talk frankly,

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:52.940
you can talk with her.

00:09:55.021 --> 00:09:55.861
I'll go with you.

00:10:04.461 --> 00:10:05.780
I've been thinking deeply.

00:10:07.861 --> 00:10:09.580
Too many painful things
happened in my home.

00:10:10.141 --> 00:10:12.180
Trusting others in a relationship
is hard for me.

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:14.180
So I want to be a lawyer

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:17.060
and handle everything

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:19.300
coldly and rationally.

00:10:20.861 --> 00:10:22.101
That's where I excel.

00:10:23.461 --> 00:10:24.580
But you're not cold.

00:10:27.021 --> 00:10:28.420
Actually, neither of us

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:30.021
dares to trust others.

00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:31.900
I truly admire Yan Fei.

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:34.741
Every time she meets someone she likes,
she loves wholeheartedly.

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:36.660
But that kind of love

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:38.540
requires tremendous energy and courage.

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.420
It only comes
from having been deeply loved yourself.

00:10:44.221 --> 00:10:44.861
I can't do that.

00:10:46.461 --> 00:10:48.300
Trust can be gradually built.

00:10:49.381 --> 00:10:50.660
Over these past few months,

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:52.300
haven't you grown
to trust me, Guo Xiaoyu,

00:10:52.341 --> 00:10:53.101
and Yan Fei

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:54.621
more and more?

00:10:55.261 --> 00:10:56.621
Especially, we're competitors!

00:10:57.580 --> 00:10:58.501
But since I found out

00:10:58.501 --> 00:11:00.060
about you taking side gigs

00:11:00.381 --> 00:11:01.141
until now

00:11:02.741 --> 00:11:03.741
- you've changed a lot.
- Yes.

00:11:05.461 --> 00:11:07.221
He can help clear Ms. Bai's name!

00:11:07.621 --> 00:11:08.168
Who?

00:11:09.621 --> 00:11:10.141
Jiang Chen.

00:11:13.741 --> 00:11:15.060
You're amazing.

00:11:18.021 --> 00:11:18.700
What do you mean?

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:20.221
Who?

00:11:26.381 --> 00:11:26.984
Ms. Bai.

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:29.780
I'm sorry.

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:31.900
I apologize on behalf of my mom.

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:35.861
I saw the clarification video

00:11:35.861 --> 00:11:37.060
you made with that boy.

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:40.060
His father got injured

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:40.861
in that incident?

00:11:43.861 --> 00:11:44.456
Yes.

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:46.420
His father

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:48.221
worked at my dad's construction site.

00:11:49.021 --> 00:11:49.900
All these years,

00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:52.221
I've been repaying their family.

00:11:53.381 --> 00:11:54.540
Just now, I called him

00:11:54.621 --> 00:11:55.940
and learned that Mr. Wang

00:11:56.221 --> 00:11:58.060
has been urging those involved
to come forward.

00:11:58.780 --> 00:11:59.820
My mom is included.

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:02.540
That's why I persuaded him to step up

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:04.101
and help me clear your name.

00:12:06.741 --> 00:12:07.432
Ms. Bai.

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:09.540
I didn't come to explain earlier

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:11.580
because I wanted
to bring a solution with me.

00:12:12.021 --> 00:12:13.900
I refuse to let this keep hurting you.

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:16.180
Since I'm part of this situation,

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:18.501
let me resolve it completely.

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:21.621
We must take responsibility
and speak the truth.

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:24.141
You're not the perpetrator

00:12:24.861 --> 00:12:25.660
or an accomplice.

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:27.660
You're an outstanding lawyer.

00:12:28.261 --> 00:12:30.780
You've consistently
helped everyone solve problems

00:12:30.861 --> 00:12:31.861
and mediate issues.

00:12:32.741 --> 00:12:34.341
From back then until now.

00:12:42.261 --> 00:12:42.940
Thank you.

00:12:44.341 --> 00:12:45.261
After all these days,

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:46.981
what you just said

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:51.261
has comforted me.

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:56.621
Ms. Bai, one more thing.

00:12:58.021 --> 00:12:59.660
When my dad suddenly died,

00:13:00.141 --> 00:13:02.221
it was emotionally devastating
for my mom.

00:13:02.341 --> 00:13:03.261
So she instinctively

00:13:03.261 --> 00:13:04.580
looked for someone to blame.

00:13:05.461 --> 00:13:07.741
She kept blaming you, but actually...

00:13:07.741 --> 00:13:09.060
How is your mom doing now?

00:13:13.741 --> 00:13:14.344
That's good.

00:13:15.141 --> 00:13:16.060
Anyway,

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:17.580
no need to say more.

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:19.660
I've been a lawyer for years

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:20.580
and met many people.

00:13:21.341 --> 00:13:22.856
On contract and financial disputes,

00:13:23.141 --> 00:13:25.501
there are always solutions
and compromises.

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:27.501
These matters are clearly defined

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:28.940
within legal frameworks.

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:30.741
Humans are complex.

00:13:31.981 --> 00:13:33.940
If you want to become a great lawyer,

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:36.060
you must understand human complexity.

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:39.660
So no more apologies to me,

00:13:40.381 --> 00:13:41.221
no matter what.

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:54.381
Before your father passed away,

00:13:54.381 --> 00:13:55.180
I did meet with him.

00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:57.381
He told me

00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:00.461
that he had a clever
and filial daughter.

00:14:01.501 --> 00:14:02.820
She'd learned about his situation

00:14:03.621 --> 00:14:05.420
and promised to repay his debts.

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:08.221
But your father said

00:14:09.021 --> 00:14:10.180
that was not what he wanted.

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:12.700
He wanted his daughter to grow up

00:14:13.261 --> 00:14:14.180
and live for herself.

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:18.940
I believe he felt regret

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:20.461
that he wouldn't

00:14:20.461 --> 00:14:22.180
watch his daughter become a lawyer.

00:14:23.461 --> 00:14:24.820
Yet I firmly believe

00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:27.540
he watches over you from above.

00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:57.420
Ren Jiatong.

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:02.580
You have the potential
to be an excellent lawyer.

00:15:05.261 --> 00:15:06.180
So keep striving.

00:15:20.101 --> 00:15:21.741
According to the plan we agreed on,

00:15:21.741 --> 00:15:22.540
your company

00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:23.861
hires professional appraisers,

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:25.341
while we promote settlement.

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:27.381
Now, the opposing party
has agreed with Xingke

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:29.780
to make a global patent
cross-licensing agreement

00:15:30.021 --> 00:15:30.760
and drop the case.

00:15:31.261 --> 00:15:31.816
Okay.

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:32.584
Thank you.

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:34.420
Additionally, you're accused

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:36.861
of trade secret infringement
against other companies.

00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:39.221
Based on the evidence
we currently possess

00:15:39.221 --> 00:15:40.420
and He Fan's testimony,

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:41.900
we can basically confirm

00:15:42.141 --> 00:15:43.940
that the person
who sent He Fan to your office

00:15:43.981 --> 00:15:45.261
to replace the client files

00:15:45.621 --> 00:15:46.780
is Xingke's competitor,

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:47.861
Asia-Pacific head, Eddie.

00:15:49.341 --> 00:15:50.420
If I'm not mistaken,

00:15:51.221 --> 00:15:52.461
Eddie has returned home.

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:53.580
He's actually back?

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:55.580
But none of us can locate him.

00:15:55.981 --> 00:15:57.021
Just five minutes ago,

00:15:57.141 --> 00:15:58.221
he posted a new photo

00:15:58.221 --> 00:15:59.420
on social media.

00:16:00.141 --> 00:16:01.501
He's at the basketball court

00:16:01.621 --> 00:16:03.021
we frequented back in high school.

00:16:03.741 --> 00:16:04.900
Mr. Song, Fei,

00:16:05.461 --> 00:16:06.900
could you go there for me?

00:16:08.021 --> 00:16:08.712
Okay.

00:16:20.981 --> 00:16:22.021
Since he chose to return,

00:16:22.741 --> 00:16:23.944
he must have figured it out.

00:16:25.021 --> 00:16:25.700
Go talk with him.

00:16:26.021 --> 00:16:26.621
I'll wait here.

00:16:26.981 --> 00:16:27.816
Call me if needed.

00:16:45.501 --> 00:16:46.024
Eddie.

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:54.141
Yan Da sent you to find me, right?

00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:55.540
How is he?

00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:00.060
He said he's very worried about you.

00:17:00.621 --> 00:17:01.940
He asked me to find you.

00:17:03.341 --> 00:17:04.620
So you did all this

00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:06.860
just to beat him?

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:08.072
Yes.

00:17:09.421 --> 00:17:10.181
I can't understand.

00:17:10.981 --> 00:17:11.580
Why?

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:13.860
Why did my dad ignore

00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:14.701
everything I do?

00:17:15.421 --> 00:17:16.620
Why should our family business

00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:17.540
only go to my brother?

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:19.140
Why did my dad back then

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:20.501
lose to Xingke?

00:17:20.741 --> 00:17:22.060
And why am I worse than Yan Da?

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:24.328
Yan Fei,

00:17:25.501 --> 00:17:26.860
do you remember

00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:28.360
when Yan Da match-made you and me?

00:17:28.661 --> 00:17:29.701
I had an ulterior motive.

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:31.540
If I could marry you,

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:33.421
I might have an opportunity

00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:34.540
to prove myself.

00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:37.860
I just wanted a chance.

00:17:39.461 --> 00:17:40.461
I wanted to win once.

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:48.300
I used to be a lot like you.

00:17:49.181 --> 00:17:50.340
But since I joined Jun An,

00:17:51.421 --> 00:17:54.060
I've met odd yet fascinating people.

00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:55.656
I'm richer than they are.

00:17:56.181 --> 00:17:57.300
I have more opportunities.

00:17:58.100 --> 00:17:58.941
But they never

00:17:58.941 --> 00:18:00.100
complain about their fate.

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:03.060
They just charge forward single-mindedly

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:04.701
for what they want.

00:18:05.701 --> 00:18:06.221
Well,

00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:08.580
don't they realize
winning depends mostly

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:10.901
on luck rather than effort?

00:18:11.941 --> 00:18:13.100
They're lawyers,

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:14.421
sharper-minded than most.

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:16.620
Yet they keep striving relentlessly.

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:18.060
Never giving up.

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:20.461
So I've learned so much

00:18:20.461 --> 00:18:21.701
from them.

00:18:22.901 --> 00:18:23.820
Over the three months,

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:24.941
we've been competing,

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:27.780
which has bred some jealousy

00:18:27.941 --> 00:18:28.780
and resentment,

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:32.181
but mostly mutual respect.

00:18:34.461 --> 00:18:35.501
That made me realize

00:18:36.221 --> 00:18:37.860
your bond with my brother

00:18:37.981 --> 00:18:38.941
must be similar, right?

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:47.021
Yan Da also mentioned

00:18:47.021 --> 00:18:49.140
that when my dad punished him
for making trouble,

00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:51.901
you told him that admitting fault
would fix everything.

00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:54.780
He said he trusts you.

00:18:55.701 --> 00:18:56.780
So he sent Mr. Song and me

00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:58.380
to find you.

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:02.620
He's such a free spirit.

00:19:03.181 --> 00:19:04.181
Locked up all these days,

00:19:05.741 --> 00:19:06.741
he must want to punch me.

00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:08.741
Then wait till he's back

00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:11.060
to fight him fair and square.

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:13.860
He said you've fought since childhood.

00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:15.060
You're used to it by now.

00:19:25.661 --> 00:19:26.221
Thank you.

00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:31.300
I can't fight anymore.

00:19:32.981 --> 00:19:33.620
Mr. Song.

00:19:40.941 --> 00:19:42.221
Could you please accompany me?

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:45.221
I'm ready to turn myself in.

00:20:06.181 --> 00:20:07.221
Guo Xiaoyu

00:20:07.461 --> 00:20:08.300
organized this.

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:09.461
Now, she's disappeared.

00:20:10.501 --> 00:20:12.941
She said the girl she met
during the legal outreach

00:20:12.941 --> 00:20:13.901
got into trouble.

00:20:15.261 --> 00:20:16.860
Is she the Hanfu enthusiast?

00:20:17.221 --> 00:20:18.820
I saw the video they posted.

00:20:18.981 --> 00:20:19.941
It was quite good.

00:20:21.021 --> 00:20:22.380
Jiang Chen went with her.

00:20:22.501 --> 00:20:23.272
It should be fine.

00:20:27.941 --> 00:20:29.780
I watched that video yesterday.

00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:31.300
The video claimed

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:32.580
that if you constantly

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:34.580
mention someone's name over and over,

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:35.820
it means you like them.

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:36.941
That makes sense.

00:20:40.741 --> 00:20:41.421
Really?

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:43.741
Did it mention anything

00:20:43.941 --> 00:20:45.380
about frequently posting something

00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:46.661
visible to one person only?

00:20:46.901 --> 00:20:47.820
It also means a crush.

00:20:49.701 --> 00:20:51.461
Ren Jiatong, come on.

00:20:51.461 --> 00:20:53.580
You always talk back.

00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:56.661
I haven't asked you yet.

00:20:57.261 --> 00:20:59.261
How did you convince He Fan?

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:00.820
I told her

00:21:01.421 --> 00:21:03.060
that Yan Da's biggest concern

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:04.860
is whether the company
can operate normally.

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:06.580
As an entrepreneur,

00:21:06.901 --> 00:21:08.741
he's responsible
for the business and staff.

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:10.300
Without halting operations,

00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:11.941
everyone needs work assignments.

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:13.221
This affects

00:21:13.261 --> 00:21:14.981
the livelihoods
of thousands of families.

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:17.780
We're all upset about what she did,

00:21:18.461 --> 00:21:19.620
but regardless,

00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:22.221
she's just a newbie in the workplace.

00:21:22.901 --> 00:21:23.540
Just like

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:24.901
when I first joined Jun An,

00:21:25.181 --> 00:21:25.941
I made mistakes.

00:21:26.701 --> 00:21:28.780
I genuinely felt overwhelmed.

00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:31.540
Yan Da personally recruited her
into Xingke.

00:21:31.941 --> 00:21:33.701
Once she's in Xingke, she is part of it.

00:21:34.261 --> 00:21:35.540
Xingke is tolerant

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:37.501
and never gives up on anyone.

00:21:37.941 --> 00:21:39.496
We can't bear responsibility for her,

00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:41.701
but we'll wait for her return.

00:21:44.021 --> 00:21:45.140
The way you said that

00:21:45.221 --> 00:21:46.661
really sounds like an entrepreneur.

00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:49.941
Those were Yan Da's words,

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:52.021
essentially his exact words.

00:21:53.661 --> 00:21:55.901
I believe
those were his sincere thoughts.

00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:58.300
He truly has it tough.

00:21:59.021 --> 00:22:00.661
I used to really resist going home,

00:22:01.261 --> 00:22:02.140
but recently

00:22:02.741 --> 00:22:04.741
I pushed myself to work through it

00:22:05.021 --> 00:22:06.060
and got hooked.

00:22:07.701 --> 00:22:09.000
Are you not returning to Jun An?

00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:11.580
Doesn't that
make our competition pointless?

00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:15.501
I used to love competing with you

00:22:15.501 --> 00:22:17.901
because you're the most special woman
I've known.

00:22:18.461 --> 00:22:20.380
You're cool-exterior
but passionate-inside.

00:22:20.661 --> 00:22:22.300
You're tough on yourself.

00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:24.181
That's why teasing you is so fun.

00:22:25.461 --> 00:22:26.421
What about him?

00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:32.620
I used to be quite spoiled,

00:22:33.261 --> 00:22:35.021
demanding things

00:22:35.701 --> 00:22:36.780
whenever I wanted them.

00:22:37.741 --> 00:22:39.701
But after everything that's happened,

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:41.300
I've matured.

00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:43.701
I will think of many things.

00:22:56.901 --> 00:22:57.780
Guo Xiaoyu's video

00:22:59.701 --> 00:23:00.540
has gone viral.

00:23:02.421 --> 00:23:03.340
What happened?

00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:06.060
This traditional Hanfu design pattern

00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:07.496
has passed its protection period.

00:23:07.496 --> 00:23:08.744
It's now in the public domain.

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:09.661
Thus, that brand

00:23:09.661 --> 00:23:11.261
didn't legally infringe.

00:23:11.501 --> 00:23:13.540
But what's your take
on Qi Tingting's video?

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:15.540
In her video, she mentioned similarity

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:17.140
and cultural appropriation.

00:23:17.352 --> 00:23:20.461
It's not about copyright infringement
in the legal sense.

00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:21.421
Rather,

00:23:21.461 --> 00:23:23.820
it's about them
using this traditional Hanfu element

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:26.181
to design their own fashion line.

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:27.560
It's cultural appropriation.

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:29.261
But cultural appropriation

00:23:29.261 --> 00:23:31.300
is quite common in artistic creation.

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:33.300
Isn't it narrow-minded
to simply criticize

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:33.981
this brand?

00:23:34.856 --> 00:23:35.421
Well...

00:23:35.501 --> 00:23:36.941
I'm afraid I don't agree with you.

00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:39.912
The reason why people are so angry

00:23:39.912 --> 00:23:40.540
is not that

00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:42.540
they used Chinese Hanfu elements. No.

00:23:42.701 --> 00:23:45.181
The real reason is
that they tried to make the pubic think

00:23:45.261 --> 00:23:46.340
that Chinese Hanfu

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:48.661
belongs to
some other dominant pop culture.

00:23:49.021 --> 00:23:50.221
This is not respectful.

00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:53.140
Chinese Hanfu is our precious heritage.

00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:54.120
They can't take it away.

00:23:54.941 --> 00:23:56.340
This is what Qi Tingting's video

00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:57.300
is trying to express.

00:23:58.181 --> 00:23:58.780
Exactly.

00:23:59.676 --> 00:24:00.456
(We should jointly safeguard,
inherit and protect our culture.)

00:24:00.456 --> 00:24:01.224
(Hanfu culture is our tradition.
Protect the culture!)

00:24:01.224 --> 00:24:01.928
(So brave! Protect and respect Hanfu culture!
Resist cultural appropriation!)

00:24:02.221 --> 00:24:03.340
Well done, you two!

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:04.701
I should've been there too.

00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:05.661
You didn't hear

00:24:05.661 --> 00:24:07.661
the applause and cheers around us.

00:24:07.981 --> 00:24:10.100
I was completely euphoric. Amazing!

00:24:10.261 --> 00:24:11.221
You're definitely.

00:24:11.741 --> 00:24:13.021
But the best part

00:24:13.021 --> 00:24:14.221
wasn't captured on video.

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:15.461
Guess what Guo Xiaoyu

00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:16.941
said privately to Qi Tingting?

00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:19.181
In big cases like this,

00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:20.340
even if she wins,

00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:21.300
the payoff is small.

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:22.941
Plus, it risks public backlash.

00:24:23.261 --> 00:24:24.941
So she advised Qi Tingting

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:27.261
to show her past photography

00:24:27.501 --> 00:24:29.100
and Hanfu culture cosplays.

00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:30.380
Demonstrate to them

00:24:30.741 --> 00:24:31.421
and let them know

00:24:31.421 --> 00:24:33.100
what attitude to show

00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:34.820
when they draw from our culture.

00:24:35.421 --> 00:24:36.060
And?

00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:37.000
And

00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:38.580
their PR department

00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:40.860
not only withdrew the lawsuit
against Qi Tingting

00:24:41.181 --> 00:24:41.860
but promised

00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:43.100
to eventually give her

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:44.501
an exciting offer.

00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:45.701
She can join them

00:24:45.701 --> 00:24:47.540
as a designer after graduation.

00:24:48.221 --> 00:24:50.540
Guo Xiaoyu, you're incredible!

00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:52.021
You're perfect for this job.

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:52.701
Really?

00:24:53.701 --> 00:24:54.300
I think so too.

00:24:59.421 --> 00:25:00.680
Sorry, I'm late. Traffic jam.

00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:02.221
Mr. Song.

00:25:03.021 --> 00:25:04.380
Look, I brought your wine.

00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:05.941
Nice wine!

00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:08.580
Didn't Ms. Bai promise
to sponsor fine wine?

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:09.421
I was at her home,

00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:10.741
so I brought it.

00:25:10.741 --> 00:25:12.540
You came from Ms. Bai's home?

00:25:12.981 --> 00:25:13.544
So what?

00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:18.501
How are things going between you two?

00:25:19.661 --> 00:25:20.540
Ms. Bai and I

00:25:20.661 --> 00:25:21.941
are just colleagues.

00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:24.060
Besides, dating is
against company policy.

00:25:26.661 --> 00:25:27.981
Alright then.

00:25:27.981 --> 00:25:29.021
Since that's the case,

00:25:29.181 --> 00:25:29.780
I'll simply

00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:31.181
forward this openly to Ms. Bai.

00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:32.181
Go ahead and send it.

00:25:34.901 --> 00:25:35.461
Or

00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:37.820
you could restate everything now,

00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:39.421
and I'll resend it to Ms. Bai

00:25:39.421 --> 00:25:40.221
as your confession.

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:42.221
Confess!

00:25:42.221 --> 00:25:43.140
Three penalty drinks.

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:43.701
Fine.

00:25:44.181 --> 00:25:44.744
Come on.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:45.661
Come on.

00:25:45.661 --> 00:25:47.501
Three, two, one.

00:25:47.501 --> 00:25:48.140
Fill it.

00:25:53.941 --> 00:25:55.701
The Xingke project is nearly wrapped up.

00:25:55.981 --> 00:25:57.661
This year's program competition

00:25:57.661 --> 00:25:58.421
is almost over.

00:25:59.221 --> 00:25:59.880
Congratulations

00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:01.421
on making the final round.

00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:03.464
Mr. Zhou.

00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:05.380
You've mentored us for three months.

00:26:05.661 --> 00:26:06.860
It couldn't have been easy.

00:26:08.936 --> 00:26:10.580
Ms. Bai and Mr. Song
are meeting clients.

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:11.540
Allow me to announce

00:26:11.701 --> 00:26:12.901
the final assessment task

00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:14.100
for the seventh round.

00:26:16.348 --> 00:26:18.860
(Mission Introduction)

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:21.140
Each of you will
give a 15-minute presentation.

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:22.340
Content format is open.

00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:22.981
Only one goal.

00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:24.461
Convince your mentor

00:26:24.741 --> 00:26:25.261
why

00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:26.820
you can

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:28.021
get this offer.

00:26:28.461 --> 00:26:29.981
Time, the day after tomorrow.

00:26:29.981 --> 00:26:31.181
Place, main conference room.

00:26:31.501 --> 00:26:32.104
Both of you,

00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:33.501
be prepared.

00:26:35.501 --> 00:26:36.501
Both of us?

00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:48.580
I have something to tell you.

00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:50.860
Last night,

00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:52.741
I submitted my application to Mr. Song.

00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:55.780
I've decided to withdraw
from the final competition.

00:26:56.181 --> 00:26:56.808
Why?

00:26:57.661 --> 00:26:58.221
Xiaoyu,

00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:00.181
did something happen at home?

00:27:00.741 --> 00:27:02.140
No, my family's fine.

00:27:02.661 --> 00:27:03.501
Well,

00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:06.261
over the past three months,

00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:11.461
I've always been the least experienced
and struggled the most with the work.

00:27:11.741 --> 00:27:12.421
Many times,

00:27:12.421 --> 00:27:13.820
I survived thanks to your help.

00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:14.860
So I made it this far.

00:27:15.501 --> 00:27:17.380
But my days in Beijing

00:27:17.421 --> 00:27:18.501
are not a waste at all.

00:27:19.221 --> 00:27:20.261
I saw so many things

00:27:20.261 --> 00:27:21.340
and learned so much too.

00:27:21.941 --> 00:27:22.901
Therefore,

00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:25.100
I want to venture beyond Beijing.

00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:26.340
See more of the world.

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:29.100
Are you applying for an LLM?

00:27:30.901 --> 00:27:32.860
Actually, I want to study media.

00:27:33.221 --> 00:27:34.060
I temporarily

00:27:35.701 --> 00:27:36.620
quit becoming a lawyer.

00:27:37.421 --> 00:27:37.941
What?

00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:39.620
Do you remember

00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:41.780
what I asked you that night?

00:27:42.181 --> 00:27:43.060
Ms. Bai is clearly

00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:44.741
the professional role model we admire.

00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:47.540
If even someone like her
gets cyberbullied,

00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:49.901
facing prejudice and misunderstandings,

00:27:50.181 --> 00:27:51.461
what should we do in the future?

00:27:51.941 --> 00:27:52.820
To be honest,

00:27:52.941 --> 00:27:54.901
at that moment, my conviction

00:27:54.901 --> 00:27:55.941
in becoming a lawyer

00:27:56.021 --> 00:27:57.701
was profoundly shaken.

00:27:58.140 --> 00:27:59.340
I suddenly couldn't understand

00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:00.820
why we work so hard,

00:28:01.221 --> 00:28:02.501
studying law, becoming lawyers.

00:28:02.501 --> 00:28:03.661
What's it all for?

00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:05.421
Until recently,

00:28:05.421 --> 00:28:07.380
after I helped Qi Tingting
resolve her situation,

00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:08.820
something that troubled me

00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:10.140
suddenly became clear.

00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:12.060
Now, I know what I should do.

00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:18.780
I may never be the best lawyer,

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:20.060
but I can

00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:21.501
become a good legal video uploader!

00:28:22.221 --> 00:28:23.461
I can show everyone

00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:25.860
what being a lawyer truly means.

00:28:26.261 --> 00:28:27.021
Tell people

00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:28.860
that whatever problems they have,

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:31.140
they can seek help
from professional lawyers

00:28:31.501 --> 00:28:33.060
to legally protect their rights.

00:28:33.461 --> 00:28:36.060
They study hard for the bar exam

00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:37.140
and become interns.

00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:38.380
They

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:40.741
don't defend criminals for money

00:28:40.741 --> 00:28:42.221
or exploit plaintiffs and defendants.

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:43.741
They

00:28:43.981 --> 00:28:45.580
hold onto their initial conviction

00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:46.701
for greater justice.

00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:48.221
They

00:28:48.261 --> 00:28:49.780
use their professional skills

00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:51.380
to help everyone in need.

00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:54.221
I want everyone to know

00:28:54.901 --> 00:28:56.820
that this profession deserves respect!

00:28:58.376 --> 00:28:59.432
You were right, Jiatong.

00:28:59.981 --> 00:29:01.901
This feels like my calling.

00:29:03.261 --> 00:29:04.340
I'm glad I heard it.

00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:07.741
If

00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:10.021
I can't be a good lawyer,

00:29:10.901 --> 00:29:11.981
then I will

00:29:12.421 --> 00:29:13.701
become the voice for lawyers!

00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:28.620
Alright,

00:29:28.901 --> 00:29:29.860
time to say goodbye.

00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:30.461
You stop here.

00:29:31.261 --> 00:29:32.580
I told you not to see me off,

00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:33.540
but you wouldn't listen.

00:29:34.021 --> 00:29:36.221
Fei, didn't your brother just get back?

00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:37.261
He's finally home.

00:29:37.261 --> 00:29:38.696
Shouldn't you spend time with him?

00:29:41.021 --> 00:29:42.140
And you two

00:29:42.661 --> 00:29:44.421
have final interviews tomorrow!

00:29:44.741 --> 00:29:46.461
Shouldn't you be preparing?

00:29:47.501 --> 00:29:48.580
Who was the one

00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:50.060
crying in my arms last night?

00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:51.620
Saying, "I didn't want to leave alone."

00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:59.421
I was moved to tears.

00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:02.340
I'm strong yet sentimental.

00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:03.368
Okay,

00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:04.701
tough girl,

00:30:05.261 --> 00:30:06.820
even back in Hangzhou,

00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:07.941
remember we lawyers

00:30:07.941 --> 00:30:09.300
are on standby 24/7.

00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:10.580
If you need anything,

00:30:10.941 --> 00:30:12.300
just call us anytime.

00:30:14.021 --> 00:30:15.181
Listen to his words.

00:30:15.421 --> 00:30:16.380
He said "we".

00:30:16.941 --> 00:30:18.701
He means

00:30:18.701 --> 00:30:21.261
you need to leave quickly
since you're the third wheel.

00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:23.060
So they can enjoy a romantic time alone.

00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:24.701
Oh, I see now.

00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:27.620
Spreading rumors
and fabricated information.

00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:28.820
Damaging someone's reputation.

00:30:28.941 --> 00:30:29.741
What's the sentence?

00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:33.192
For severe cases,
imprisonment for up to three years.

00:30:33.192 --> 00:30:34.888
Criminal detention
or public surveillance.

00:30:36.501 --> 00:30:37.981
Did you hear me spreading any rumors?

00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:39.181
Being perfectly in sync.

00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:44.901
Seriously,

00:30:44.901 --> 00:30:46.021
why are you in such a hurry?

00:30:46.261 --> 00:30:47.701
After they finish their interviews

00:30:47.701 --> 00:30:49.741
and I hand over company matters
to my brother,

00:30:49.901 --> 00:30:51.368
we can dine together before you go.

00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:52.820
I'd love to,

00:30:53.421 --> 00:30:55.421
but my schedule is tight right now.

00:30:57.140 --> 00:31:00.461
I need to handle graduation paperwork.

00:31:00.461 --> 00:31:02.021
Then study for the TOEFL exam.

00:31:02.021 --> 00:31:04.300
Plus, prepare all application materials.

00:31:05.181 --> 00:31:06.501
But most importantly,

00:31:06.901 --> 00:31:08.661
the platform
where I've been posting videos

00:31:09.741 --> 00:31:10.620
has signed me.

00:31:13.981 --> 00:31:14.540
Seriously?

00:31:15.021 --> 00:31:15.780
That's fantastic.

00:31:15.981 --> 00:31:17.140
Does that mean we early fans

00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:17.941
can become a leader

00:31:17.941 --> 00:31:20.060
of your fan club or something?

00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:21.501
And earn some extra cash together?

00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:23.501
It's too early to say that.

00:31:23.941 --> 00:31:24.780
But I'm confident.

00:31:24.901 --> 00:31:25.941
My content will meet

00:31:25.941 --> 00:31:26.901
all your expectations.

00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:28.380
Absolutely.

00:31:28.421 --> 00:31:30.820
You're the best video editor
among law students.

00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:32.780
And the most legally
knowledgeable uploader.

00:31:32.981 --> 00:31:34.380
Plus, you're the most big-hearted

00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:36.461
and always stand up against injustice.

00:31:37.421 --> 00:31:38.221
I agree.

00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:39.300
I feel like

00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:42.461
I'm not the same Guo Xiaoyu
who arrived in Beijing three months ago.

00:31:42.461 --> 00:31:43.860
I've changed completely.

00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:45.461
This time,

00:31:45.701 --> 00:31:47.741
my feelings are completely different
from last time.

00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:52.981
So much has happened
over these three months.

00:31:53.701 --> 00:31:54.901
I'm only 22.

00:31:55.021 --> 00:31:55.820
But I've experienced

00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:58.221
how life is like opening mystery boxes.

00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:01.021
I originally came to Beijing
to become a lawyer.

00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:02.380
But unexpectedly,

00:32:03.021 --> 00:32:05.501
I discovered something
I'm even more passionate about.

00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:07.380
This feels amazing.

00:32:09.021 --> 00:32:11.501
Even if I change my mind later,

00:32:12.021 --> 00:32:12.820
I won't be afraid.

00:32:13.461 --> 00:32:16.340
Because I know whatever I pursue,

00:32:16.741 --> 00:32:17.620
I'll succeed.

00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:24.456
Oh right.

00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:25.780
A couple of days ago,

00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:28.540
Mr. Zhou asked me about Hangzhou.

00:32:29.261 --> 00:32:30.580
He received a job offer

00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:32.181
from a law firm in Hangzhou.

00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:34.060
Why?

00:32:34.221 --> 00:32:34.901
I don't know.

00:32:36.701 --> 00:32:37.741
You don't know?

00:32:38.421 --> 00:32:40.181
Then why don't you ask him yourself?

00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:43.380
Mr. Song couldn't make it.

00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:44.461
He let me give you this.

00:32:44.701 --> 00:32:45.320
It's called...

00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:47.181
What's it called again?

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:47.941
Bao'er.

00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:48.741
Yes, that's it.

00:32:50.261 --> 00:32:51.461
I absolutely love it.

00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:52.501
Exactly.

00:32:52.741 --> 00:32:53.901
Right, he said you'd love it.

00:32:54.981 --> 00:32:56.181
Please thank Mr. Song for me.

00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:59.021

is so nice.

Keep it up.

00:33:56.221 --> 00:33:57.300
See you.

00:34:19.301 --> 00:34:20.008
What's so funny?

00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:21.461
It's nothing.

Jiang Chen and Ren Jiatong

00:34:23.941 --> 00:34:25.540
will become lawyers in the future.

00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:27.021
Their acting was so fake.

00:34:27.301 --> 00:34:29.301
They told me they wanted to leave alone

00:34:29.381 --> 00:34:31.861
for special preparations

00:34:31.861 --> 00:34:33.540
for tomorrow's final interview.

00:34:35.660 --> 00:34:36.580
I told them to leave.

00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:39.620
Why?

00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:41.381
Mr. Zhou.

00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:42.821
Aren't you afraid of gossip?

00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:43.720
Yan Fei.

00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:45.100
I never thought...

00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:45.821
About what?

00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:49.580
Did I misunderstand you earlier?

00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:52.260
Honestly, I might be confused.

00:34:52.941 --> 00:34:53.781
You make it clear.

00:34:58.821 --> 00:35:00.700
You were so good at reasoning before.

00:35:01.341 --> 00:35:02.220
Why are you silent?

00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:09.160
Yan Fei.

00:35:09.781 --> 00:35:11.461
I feel there's something between us.

00:35:12.461 --> 00:35:13.381
So I didn't tell you.

00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:15.301
I'm not afraid of doubts

00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:17.100
but of affecting you.

00:35:17.861 --> 00:35:18.941
Whether it's your family

00:35:20.021 --> 00:35:21.421
or others doubting your abilities,

00:35:21.421 --> 00:35:22.152
I don't want that.

00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:25.060
Have you ever asked me

00:35:25.501 --> 00:35:26.260
what I want?

00:35:27.861 --> 00:35:28.941
I know what you mean.

00:35:30.301 --> 00:35:31.180
But

00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:33.461
I've always carefully

00:35:33.461 --> 00:35:35.501
followed my own life plan

00:35:36.021 --> 00:35:36.781
to live a simple

00:35:37.021 --> 00:35:39.021
and risk-free life.

00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:41.540
Until I became your mentor.

00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:44.021
Until you barged into my life,

00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:46.660
I felt alive again.

00:35:47.901 --> 00:35:48.620
I know I can't

00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:49.740
leave you that easily.

00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:53.861
I like you.

00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:56.620
I hope I can be a part of your plans.

00:35:57.260 --> 00:35:58.660
Maybe we really can...

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:03.220
Haven't you

00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:04.021
got your job offer

00:36:04.021 --> 00:36:04.740
in Hangzhou?

00:36:05.381 --> 00:36:06.381
When are you leaving?

00:36:06.501 --> 00:36:07.301
I'll see you off.

00:36:07.301 --> 00:36:08.136
I turned it down.

00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:11.112
Once I got to the airport,
I knew what I really wanted.

00:36:12.781 --> 00:36:13.461
So,

00:36:14.381 --> 00:36:16.580
when Guo Xiaoyu just told me all that,

00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:18.060
she was testing me.

00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:21.381
Honestly,

00:36:22.301 --> 00:36:24.821
when Guo Xiaoyu told me
you were going to Hangzhou,

00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:27.540
my heart really did skip a beat.

00:36:28.781 --> 00:36:29.580
But I've changed.

00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:31.901
For work, I can push through.

00:36:32.941 --> 00:36:34.060
For our relationship,

00:36:35.021 --> 00:36:35.821
leave it to fate.

00:36:38.461 --> 00:36:39.060
Fate?

00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:47.941
Starting now,
on our way back to the firm,

00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:50.381
if every traffic light is green,

00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:51.501
then I'll be with you.

00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:54.220
But if even one is red, then it's over

00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:55.501
between us.

00:36:56.540 --> 00:36:57.781
I won't accept that!

00:36:57.981 --> 00:36:59.100
That's so unfair!

00:36:59.381 --> 00:37:00.821
That's for me to decide.

00:37:01.981 --> 00:37:03.861
If you don't want to try it, fine.

00:37:04.021 --> 00:37:04.744
Okay, let's do it.

00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:06.021
I'm not

00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:07.981
giving up any chance.

00:37:08.981 --> 00:37:09.736
I believe in fate.

00:37:11.341 --> 00:37:11.944
Alright.

00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:13.981
Then we'll accept the outcome.

00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:36.301
Tomorrow's the final interview.

00:37:37.341 --> 00:37:38.700
Who do you hope stays?

00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:45.032
I guess you'll choose Ren Jiatong.

00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:46.660
Stop guessing!

00:37:47.301 --> 00:37:48.941
Adults don't make choices.

00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:50.421
I want them both.

00:37:51.981 --> 00:37:52.821
Well,

00:37:53.301 --> 00:37:54.740
I saw people online saying

00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:56.580
Gen Z is shaking up the workplace.

00:37:56.981 --> 00:37:58.540
I actually think this generation

00:37:59.501 --> 00:38:00.100
knows exactly

00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:01.901
what they want.

00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:04.461
They're smarter,
more talented, and better

00:38:05.021 --> 00:38:05.700
at making choices

00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:07.341
than we were.

00:38:08.341 --> 00:38:08.904
True.

00:38:11.461 --> 00:38:12.861
There's something about Jiang Chen

00:38:12.861 --> 00:38:14.301
that I never had at his age.

00:38:16.421 --> 00:38:17.032
Like what?

00:38:18.021 --> 00:38:18.781
Like courage.

00:38:19.688 --> 00:38:22.344
He dared to fish for information from me
about the firm's attitudes

00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:24.260
towards office romance.

00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:26.180
Then how did you answer?

00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:29.821
I said,

00:38:31.821 --> 00:38:33.160
"If there was one more chance,"

00:38:37.021 --> 00:38:37.740
"would I leave?"

00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:04.421
Why are you zoning out here?

00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:06.100
Are you nervous?

00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:07.501
You fear you'll lose?

00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:11.740
I realize when we enter that door

00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:12.700
tomorrow,

00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:14.901
the program will truly be over then.

00:39:16.981 --> 00:39:18.220
We've all changed quite a bit.

00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:19.700
Each one of us came

00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:20.901
for this job offer.

00:39:21.381 --> 00:39:22.461
But we've gained something

00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:23.861
more important than an offer.

00:39:24.381 --> 00:39:24.904
What?

00:39:25.501 --> 00:39:26.341
Trying to let me win?

00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:28.540
One thing I've learned
is not to go easy on you.

00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:31.496
Otherwise, it'd be disrespectful
to a future good lawyer.

00:39:32.861 --> 00:39:33.421
Jiang Chen.

00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:35.580
You've changed.

00:39:37.301 --> 00:39:37.981
Haven't you?

00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:40.260
When you joined Jun An,

00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:41.821
you'd sacrifice anything to win.

00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:42.792
What about now?

00:39:43.941 --> 00:39:45.060
As Guo Xiaoyu said,

00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:47.048
could you really disregard Yan Fei,

00:39:47.461 --> 00:39:48.060
her,

00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:49.821
or me?

00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:53.501
Why are you being talkative?

00:39:56.861 --> 00:39:57.381
Ren Jiatong.

00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:00.740
You're someone I like

00:40:02.341 --> 00:40:03.301
and my rival.

00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:05.981
So tomorrow, I'll give it my all

00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:07.100
to compete with you.

00:40:08.381 --> 00:40:09.580
But anyway, no matter

00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:10.620
who stays

00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:11.620
or goes,

00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:15.620
it won't change the fact
that we'll both become good lawyers.

00:40:16.461 --> 00:40:17.781
And it won't change that I...

00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:21.576
I'll tell you later.

00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:35.781
No need.

00:40:35.981 --> 00:40:36.501
I understand.

00:40:37.781 --> 00:40:38.301
Jiang Chen.

00:40:38.861 --> 00:40:39.528
Thank you.

00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:41.341
For being my rival.

00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:44.821
One more thing.

00:40:46.981 --> 00:40:47.981
Two cameras over there.

00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:54.060
Let them be a memento

00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:54.861
of the three months.

00:40:56.700 --> 00:40:57.301
Mr. Jiang.

00:40:57.781 --> 00:40:58.381
Go for it.

00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:00.861
You too.

00:41:01.421 --> 00:41:02.120

Mr. Zhuang.

00:41:32.501 --> 00:41:34.381
Our revenue growth has slowed this year.

00:41:34.501 --> 00:41:36.180
Other law firms are cutting costs,

00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:37.981
while our firm maintains salaries

00:41:37.981 --> 00:41:39.341
without cuts, which is not easy.

00:41:39.981 --> 00:41:41.021
In the program,

00:41:41.021 --> 00:41:42.660
we have two remaining interns this year.

00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:44.341
They're both outstanding.

00:41:44.941 --> 00:41:46.421
But the HR department will

00:41:46.421 --> 00:41:47.620
advise the firm

00:41:47.821 --> 00:41:49.100
to keep just one position open.
