00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.000
(Four months ago)

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.900
(New Semester: 2nd Year Class Assignments)

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.680
No way.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.870
Class 5 is stacked this year, huh?

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.496
- Seriously, the Big Four are all in one class.
- That's insane...

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.180
- I'll come hang out sometime.
- For sure.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.880
They're good-looking.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.540
They've got great personalities.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.250
In every single way.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.960
Sometimes I wish I was just a normal guy.

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:05.190
He's so handsome.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.180
You're so lucky.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.770
- I've used up all my luck for the year on this.
- He's seriously handsome.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.050
Watarai-kun?

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.240
Huh?

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.360
Oh.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.300
Hey.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:21.950
I'm Nakasato.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.800
Nakasato Haruki.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.170
Yeah.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:26.620
Hey.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.170
Honestly...

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.440
it's kind of a pain.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:34.490
Huh?

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.239
We've never even talked before,

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.256
and people are calling us
"The Big Four" or whatever.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.130
Don't just lump us together
like we're the final bosses.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.910
- Tell me about it.
- Right?

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.080
What are you doing?

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.229
That's...

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:55.330
my seat.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.790
Oh, sorry.

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.120
Oh, I'm not mad or anything.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.710
I was just born with this scowl.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.850
Oh, Morisaki.

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.480
We're in the same class again.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:11.580
Looking forward to it.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.110
Huh?

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.520
Who are they?

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.120
Friends of yours?

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:19.960
Nah, no idea.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:21.410
Who are they?

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.040
Hey, wait a sec.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.150
We're supposed to be "The Big Four,"

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.280
but we don't even know each other's names.
That's pretty funny.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.300
Well, whatever. I
don't really get it either.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.140
I'm Hotta.

00:02:37.141 --> 00:02:39.110
- Nice to meet you.
- I'm Nakasato.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:40.590
And...

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:41.850
this is Watarai-kun.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.040
Just Watarai is fine.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:45.890
Nice to meet you.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:48.420
I'm Morisaki.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:49.740
Nice to meet you.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.660
Wait, what class were
you guys in first year?

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:52.780
- Class 3.
- Class 3?

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.589
Wait, wasn't what's-his-name in Class 3?

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.076
The guy who crashed his bike
into a tree and flew into a rice paddy.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.676
Sato, the one who walked
away without a scratch.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:59.700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:00.180
You know about that?

00:03:00.181 --> 00:03:01.620
- So crazy, right?
- You knew?

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.930
Back then, I had no idea.

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.770
That four months later...

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.500
I would confess my feelings

00:03:16.227 --> 00:03:18.007
to a boy whose name I didn't even know.

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.460
"School Trip: Joined A Group I'm Not Close to"

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:24.469
(Episode 7: The Encounter)
It all started...

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:25.860
with something completely trivial.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.239
All right, I'm passing out the handouts.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.940
Fill them out and pass them to the front.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.500
Make sure you use a pen.

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.020
- Watarai, can I borrow your pen when you're done?
- Sure.

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:56.950
Here you go.

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:58.350
Thanks.

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:10.690
Huh?

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:13.360
Don't tell me...

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:15.850
A pen...

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:17.270
you didn't bring one?

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:21.880
I didn't.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:27.640
Hold on.

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:34.030
You can borrow mine.

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.670
Are... Are you sure?

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:39.940
Go ahead.

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:50.930
- What's her deal?
- Right?

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:52.490
She could've just asked the teacher.

00:05:52.596 --> 00:05:54.066
- Totally.
- I know.

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:55.458
She could have at least
asked the person next to her.

00:05:55.482 --> 00:05:55.870
Exactly.

00:05:55.871 --> 00:05:57.739
- I would've just asked the person beside me.
- It's so weird.

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.130
- She's totally doing that on purpose.
- I know, she has to be.

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:05.999
- Anyone would just ask the person next to them.
- So lame.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.480
I bet she has one in her pencil case.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:09.430
Sorry about that.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.230
Thank you.

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:14.810
Yeah.

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:30.140
In a situation like that...

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:33.510
what's the right thing to do?

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:36.780
Still, those four have it so easy.

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.320
They're playing life on easy mode.

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:40.580
I know.

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:42.170
Especially Watarai.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.019
If I had his face...

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:46.640
I'd have, like, ten girlfriends by now.

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:48.750
For all we know, he probably does.

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:50.769
He literally just lent someone a pen...

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:52.610
and all the girls started freaking out.

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:54.690
Seriously. Life must be so easy for him.

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:00.370
This kind of thing has always happened.

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:02.480
I'm used to it.

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:04.390
But...

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.590
even so...

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.040
it doesn't mean it doesn't sting.

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:12.700
Oh.

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:14.010
Wait.

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:15.890
Don't we have our committee meeting today?

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:17.980
You're right... I completely forgot.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.560
Oh, I have to go too.

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:22.370
What should we do?

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:23.790
You wanna head home first?

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.590
Nah, I'll just wait here for you guys.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.076
All right, see you in a bit.

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:30.020
- We'll hit you up as soon as we're done.
- Okay.

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:39.600
So, how's the new class?

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.626
You've got those "Big
Four" guys in there, right?

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:42.650
Oh yeah.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.409
- We do.
- And?

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:46.010
So are they as popular as everyone says?

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:47.530
Here we go again.

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:52.020
Well, I've never actually
talked to them, so...

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:54.950
Hioki's not exactly the
type to start a conversation.

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:57.050
Hioki?

00:07:58.620 --> 00:07:59.720
Who's that?

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:02.230
Anyway...

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:04.020
What's Watarai like?

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:06.540
What terrible timing.

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:08.850
I just told you, I've never spoken to him.

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:12.040
Come on, even so, you must
have some kind of impression, right?

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:15.790
Like, does he seem cheerful or gloomy?
Just your first impression...

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:17.590
Let's see...

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:19.250
How do I put this...

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:22.740
I know I shouldn't be eavesdropping.

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:26.220
He seems... nice, I guess.

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:28.270
Really?

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:30.530
That's kind of surprising. Why? Tell me.

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:32.990
It's nothing, it's just...

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:35.310
he lent his pen to a girl who forgot hers.

00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:37.270
Huh?

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:39.000
Huh? That's it?

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:41.270
That's the most useless
piece of information ever.

00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:42.110
Aww...

00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:44.716
- How is that interesting?
- I was hoping his parents were celebrities or something.

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:46.976
- Or that he was dating some influencer.
- What a stereotype.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.050
But, I mean...

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:50.910
- Everyone says stuff like that.
- I don't really get it though.

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:51.730
But from what I saw...

00:08:51.731 --> 00:08:53.750
he's just a genuinely nice, normal guy.

00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:57.940
You're so pure.

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:01.530
- That's what's great about this dummy.
- Hey!

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.210
It's pretty much her only good quality.

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:05.050
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:06.540
Club practice, club practice!

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:07.680
Hey!

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:09.590
- We're screwed.
- We're screwed.

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:13.260
- I don't wanna get yelled at by the whole team!
- No one's gonna yell at you!

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:31.110
It was the first time...

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:33.920
a guy had ever complimented
me on my personality.

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:36.350
And...

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:39.010
it was from someone
I'd never even spoken to,

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:42.400
praising me when he
thought I wasn't listening.

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:55.990
Hioki...

00:09:57.690 --> 00:09:58.690
Asahi...

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:04.930
It was something so small...

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:07.090
but to me...

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.650
it brought me a
happiness I'll never forget.

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:16.230
From then on...

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:18.550
at first, I just...

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:20.560
wanted to talk to him.

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:24.400
- Watarai-kun, good morning.
- Morning.

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:30.749
- Watarai-kun, you're so popular!
- Whoa, that's amazing.

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:32.270
Are all of these love letters?

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:33.370
But...

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:34.890
the more I became aware of him...

00:10:34.914 --> 00:10:35.914
Thanks, everyone.

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:38.940
The harder it became
to find the right moment.

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:43.810
Here he comes. Hioki.

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:48.510
Okay, here I go... Hioki.

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:52.680
Behind you, behind you! Hurry!

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:55.540
Whoa!

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:57.880
Come on!

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.240
Next one!

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:05.720
Excuse me!

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:07.186
Could you throw the ball down?

00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:08.210
Please!

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:11.700
Tsujitani, get up!

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.560
What are you even doing?

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:14.630
Before I knew it...

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:17.850
I couldn't even manage
to say "good morning."

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:20.400
A whole month had passed just like that.

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:32.676
(School Trip Group Assignments)
All right, first off...

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:35.340
I need you to get into
groups of three to five.

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:36.250
Once you've formed your groups...

00:11:36.251 --> 00:11:40.080
- Please write your members' names on
this sheet. (I hope this can be my chance.)

00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:41.690
All right, then.

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:42.710
You may begin.

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:51.600
Amusement Park.

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:53.620
Okay, I got the sign-up sheet.

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:55.386
The teacher said to write our
names on this and turn it in.

00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:57.806
(School Trip Group Sign-up)
Thanks. Can you write my name down for me?

00:11:57.830 --> 00:11:59.560
- Write mine down too.
- OK.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000
My chance.

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:04.070
This is it.

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:06.520
Hm? What did you say?

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:08.300
Oh, it's nothing.

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:09.670
Oh, by the way,

00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:12.020
what's the max number
of people for a group?

00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:14.010
Um, I think it's five people max.

00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:16.010
In that case,

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:17.780
can we add one more person?

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:19.760
Huh?

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:21.779
It's just that...

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:22.780
Like, for example...

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:25.290
Hioki-kun.

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:28.150
Hioki-kun?

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:29.460
Who's that?

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:33.680
Huh? Are you close with Hioki-kun?

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:36.290
No, I'm not...

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:37.970
I've never actually talked to him.

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:44.120
Right.

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:45.500
I know this is sudden.

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:47.620
Me asking this out of the blue.

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:50.520
- Sorry, never mind...
- Sure.

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:52.310
Huh?

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:53.990
I mean...

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:55.880
what's one more person, right?

00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:58.440
I'll go get him.

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:00.320
Huh? Really?

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:02.710
Yeah, Hioki-kun and I went
to the same middle school.

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:04.130
I'll go ask him.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:08.320
Hioki-kun, have you decided on a group yet?

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:10.290
I never thought

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:12.740
things would go this smoothly.

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:15.240
No, but...

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:17.679
- what will Hioki-kun say?
- Okay.

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:19.710
- Then it's settled.
- Wait.

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:23.830
Hioki-kun says he'll join our group.

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:26.230
- No, I...
- Just kidding.

00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:28.290
Seriously?

00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:29.870
Ah.

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:31.180
Um...

00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:33.050
Watarai-kun,

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:36.170
right?

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:38.460
Are you sure you want me in your group?

00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:41.140
Yeah.

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:43.080
By the way,

00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:44.430
you can just call me Watarai.

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:46.310
I talked to him.

00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:48.250
For the first time.

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:50.290
Oh.

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:52.050
This is Nakasato-kun and...

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:53.480
Morisaki-kun.

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:54.680
Nice to meet you.

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:56.370
Nice to meet you.

00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:58.770
So, it's settled then?

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:01.120
Huh?

00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:07.030
I'm grateful,
looking forward to it.

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:14.260
Just like that,

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:18.290
I was in the same group as
my crush for the school trip.

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:41.610
At first, all I wanted...

00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:43.090
was to talk to him.

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:48.160
Okay.

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:51.790
Sitting next to him,

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:54.530
little by little,

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:56.890
as I got to know Hioki-kun,

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:00.680
that simple feeling

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:02.740
of just wanting to talk to him.

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:06.780
Wow.

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:08.970
Began to swell every time we grew closer,

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:11.560
growing bigger and bigger.

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:20.630
So? Think you and Hioki-kun
can become good friends?

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:23.060
Huh? What do you mean?

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:25.140
Because...

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:27.820
you asked him because you
wanted to be friends, right?

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:30.100
I mean, there's no other reason, is there?

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:33.900
Well...

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:35.480
I guess,

00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:45.180
I want to know more

00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:47.270
about Hioki-kun.

00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:50.930
My name is

00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:54.050
Asahi.

00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:57.390
That's so cute.

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:01.950
The more I learned about him,

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:04.260
the more endearing I found him.

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:06.040
I really like it.

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:08.140
Gradually, I started wanting more.

00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:11.020
Because I'm lonely.

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:14.670
Just let me stay like this a little longer.

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:17.260
Before I knew it,

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:20.490
I was already hopelessly...

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:24.350
You like him, don't you?

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:26.250
Asahi...

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:31.910
It's totally obvious.

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:33.560
We're in the same boat.

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:37.020
Even so,

00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:39.880
I was scared to say
these feelings out loud.

00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:45.170
You're not going to tell Asahi?

00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:48.750
Probably not.

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:51.580
It would just make things awkward for him.

00:16:58.980 --> 00:16:59.980
I see.

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:06.860
And yet, I...

00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:14.150
So, in other words,

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:15.440
Watarai,

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.180
do you have feelings for me?

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:23.960
I...

00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:27.280
like you, Hioki-kun.

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:35.090
Um, as in,

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:36.360
I mean,

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:38.400
uh...

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:40.630
in a romantic way.

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:45.320
Yeah.

00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:55.050
I'm sorry.

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:57.390
I didn't mean to say it.

00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:58.760
This must be weird for you.

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:01.040
You can just forget about it.

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:03.040
Ah.

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:04.480
I'll go get a cold towel.

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:07.900
I knew it.

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:10.400
I shouldn't have said anything.

00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:12.950
Wait.

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:21.240
Sorry.

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:22.400
Um.

00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:27.650
I've...

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:29.430
never

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:31.880
been in a relationship before.

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:36.460
No one's ever

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:37.860
confessed to me,

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:39.550
and I've never confessed to anyone.

00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:41.750
When it comes to romance,

00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:44.170
I don't get it at all.

00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:46.740
Even though I don't understand it,

00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:50.240
the feeling of liking someone

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:52.040
is...

00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:53.810
something anyone is free to feel.

00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:56.590
Watarai,

00:18:56.910 --> 00:18:58.790
the fact that you like me,

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:02.320
I don't think there's
anything wrong with that.

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:05.020
I guess I support you?

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:06.940
No, that sounds weird, doesn't it?

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:08.140
Um.

00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:11.130
Huh?

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:14.740
Anyway,

00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:17.970
I'm not bothered at all.

00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:23.910
Wait, so,

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:25.540
you're not bothered by it?

00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:27.550
Right.

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:31.860
Being with you is fun, Watarai.

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:35.140
And I feel comfortable around you.

00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:38.560
But whether those feelings

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:40.150
are romantic or not,

00:19:40.151 --> 00:19:42.240
I have no idea.

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:45.330
So,

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:49.080
I can't give you an answer right away.

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:51.900
But even so,

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:54.860
I want to think about this seriously.

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:00.880
Hioki-kun.

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:03.360
So,

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:05.280
it might take some time,

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:08.350
but my answer...

00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:10.080
could you wait for it?

00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:15.150
Of course.

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:17.460
Hioki-kun is...

00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:19.330
the one I fell for.

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:21.780
He's always so pure.

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:24.360
He just honestly...

00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:27.120
looks right at me for who I am.

00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:29.090
Can I just

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:32.500
keep liking you?

00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:35.740
Yeah.

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:40.520
Thank you.

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:52.400
In that case,

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:55.520
I don't have to hold back anymore.

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:57.640
Huh?

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:00.750
Wait,

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:04.340
what did you just say?

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:08.170
I said I won't hold back anymore.

00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:11.240
So you'd better be prepared.

00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:20.170
Prepared for what...?

00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:22.200
What... what do you mean?

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:32.040
I'm going to show you
just how much I like you.

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:34.700
I'm going to make it clear.

00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:37.550
Make it clear...

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:41.209
No, but before that,

00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:43.550
- you might start to hate me, Watarai...
- Impossible.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.050
I'll make my feelings for
you clear all over again.

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:55.070
You don't have to rush your answer.

00:21:58.930 --> 00:21:59.930
Okay.

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:03.540
Oh.

00:22:04.450 --> 00:22:05.770
By the way, are you feeling okay?

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:07.100
Are you alright now?

00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:10.580
I think so.

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:12.430
I see.

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:14.600
That's good.

00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:20.860
Hey, you alright?

00:22:22.530 --> 00:22:23.630
We're good.

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:25.540
We're on our way.

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:28.830
Alright, let's go.

00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:31.020
Okay.

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:34.580
Anyway...

00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:38.100
Until you're of age, Hioki,
you are not to drink with anyone but me.

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:39.840
- Why not?
- Just because.

00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:41.326
What about people you know, Watarai?

00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:42.350
Nope. Not even them.

00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:43.760
No way. Absolutely not!

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:46.800
If you're ever going to
drink with other people,

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.930
you have to let me know first.

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:50.980
Got it.

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:53.000
I can't drink either...

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:55.916
(Next Episode) (Fall Culture
Festival) When you get all shy like that...

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:56.940
I love that, too.

00:22:58.090 --> 00:22:59.980
- Then marry me.
- Huh?

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:02.610
(Sudden School Confession?!)
Please.

00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:07.300
I'm serious. I really like you.
