[Reborn from the Ashes]

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.440
[Episode 24]

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.670
Your Highness, please eat more.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:18.480
Alright.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.000
I wonder when a concubine is allowed
to dine at the table.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.880
Even food can't silence your complaints.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.920
Madam,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.800
I am still young,

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.990
and don't know proper manners.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.110
Please forgive me.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.630
I offer tea in place of wine,

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:35.590
as a toast to you.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.630
Yi, are you alright?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.710
Just putting on airs.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.230
Madam,

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.730
you've been through pregnancy too,

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.070
so you understand
the hardships involved.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.150
However,

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.670
you haven't borne a child in years.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:01.320
You...

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.320
Enough.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.500
Everyone, say a little less.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:04.800
She's still young.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.240
Can't you give her some space?

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.400
You're truly considerate.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.670
Su Qingran, what exactly

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.480
makes everyone like you?

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:22.630
Young Master Qi,

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.360
you've been staring at Qingran
since you sat down.

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.710
Is it because
she resembles your late wife?

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.110
Are you using this to remember her?

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:34.630
It's just that

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.190
Jin and Qingran are deeply close.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.230
It reminds me that Yueqian treated me
the same way back then.

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.400
But I didn't cherish her then.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.070
Now, I carry some regret in my heart.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:48.800
If time could turn back,

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.360
I would treat her with all my care.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.040
Qi,

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.270
belated affection is worth less
than grass.

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:59.550
Qi,

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.070
everyone knows exactly
what kind of person you are.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.270
No need to pretend to be sentimental.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.440
It seems you have
quite a misunderstanding about me.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.110
You know clearly in your heart

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.040
whether it's a misunderstanding.

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.000
Sister, you really has some skill.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.440
The crown prince obeys you
without question.

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.440
Now even Young Master Qi
is showing you special favor.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.480
Teach me.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.150
I also want to win His Highness's heart.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.040
Auntie Su,

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.000
compared to you,

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.320
I'm just a small player.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.400
What do you mean by that?

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.840
I have always belonged
to His Highness alone.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.360
Oh?

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.800
So you're not a real man after all.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.150
Qingran,

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:52.800
watch your words.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.550
You've been having morning sickness
and eating less lately.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.480
Eat more. Here.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.590
Did you feel

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.110
that something was off
with Wanyan Qi and Su Feiyi just now?

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:13.900
You're so concerned about him.

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:15.750
Of course.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.960
After all, he used to be your husband.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:19.490
Xiao Jin,

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.190
if you have something to say,
just say it.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.670
Why the sarcasm?

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.440
I've searched Su Feiyi's place
thoroughly.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.070
But I couldn't find the account book
anywhere.

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.270
Once I get the account book,

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.960
I can bring Wanyan Lie to justice.

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.110
I want to avenge my father
and the Qilin Army.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.800
Then, I'll make Wanyan Lie
reveal the truth from back then.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.040
I want to clear my father's name.

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.840
Since we can't find it
at Su Feiyi's place,

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.960
then let her bring it out herself.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.590
My Lord, My Lady,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.240
Prince Han's letter has arrived.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.000
Why would Prince Han write to me?

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:01.440
The letter is addressed to you.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.960
[To Qingran]

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.750
Hmph.

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.110
Hey, hey, hey.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.750
Since when did you get so close
with Prince Han?

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.590
And he even misses you so much.

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.230
Do you want to see it?

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:33.230
Here you go.

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.290
I'll show you everything.

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.370
Send it to her right away.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.000
That's really unnecessary.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.710
How did you get here so quickly?

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.230
Last time, you promised

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.440
to take me on a proper tour
of Yunzhou City.

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:04.630
Does that still count?

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:05.710
Of course.

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:08.880
Of course not.

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.400
You're a married woman.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.400
Going on an outing with other men

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.190
doesn't seem proper.

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:17.320
Bai Ze,

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.270
you will be with Prince Han these days.

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.630
Show him around Yunzhou City well.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:22.670
Prince Han,

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.040
Bai Ze knows Yunzhou City very well.

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.320
Make sure to let Prince Han

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:29.400
fully

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.360
appreciate the scenery here.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:34.880
The darned Wanyan Jin.

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:39.040
Fine.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.230
Prince Han has arrived in Yunzhou City?

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.880
Yes.

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.190
He has been with the crown prince
and consort these days.

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.750
I heard he came for leisure.

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:51.800
Leisure? Humph.

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.550
He's fooling a child.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.480
Your Highness, the court is tense
these days.

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:01.590
The Emperor seems
to suspect the military pay.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.960
Could it be that Prince Han...

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:05.400
Mmm.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.750
That's what I thought as well.

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:09.670
I'm afraid

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.150
he's after the military pay.

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:14.060
Have someone keep a close watch on him.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.630
Report Prince Han's movements
to me every night.

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:18.110
If necessary...

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:24.520
He's just a powerless, idle prince.

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:28.070
Yet he dares to cause trouble
in my territory.

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.150
If he behaves well, that's fine.

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.270
But if he gets any ideas,

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:34.840
don't blame me for being ruthless.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.960
How's the investigation
into the account book going?

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:40.920
I've been watching Concubine Su
for a long time,

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:43.230
but still no leads.

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.880
And now she's pregnant.

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:47.960
I worry something might happen to her.

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:49.320
Idiot!

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.750
You can't even tell
what's more important.

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.670
This account book is a matter
of my life.

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:56.320
If I lose my head,

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.230
what's the use of having more children?

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:00.040
I deserve to die.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.110
I will keep a close eye on Concubine Su

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.390
and find the account book.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:04.960
Get lost!

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:06.070
Yes.

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:23.630
Su Qingran,

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.670
have you never seen anything good?

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.880
Such a shoddy thing is enough
to buy you off?

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:28.990
I don't have time for you.

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:31.190
You can play with him,

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.750
but don't let a man distract you
from important matters.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.630
Wanyan Jin, what exactly do you mean?

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:39.210
When have I been playing with him?

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.440
I've seen you having a great time
with Yan Shaoxuan

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.800
these past few days.

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:55.800
Wanyan Jin,

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:57.710
how did I never notice

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.330
you get so jealous so easily before?

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:00.750
How could I...

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:01.960
Who said I was jealous?

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.230
Don't falsely accuse me.
