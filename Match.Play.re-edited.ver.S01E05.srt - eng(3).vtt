00:00:02.292 --> 00:00:03.750
Next time,

00:00:03.875 --> 00:00:05.792
want to go on a date with me?

00:00:09.458 --> 00:00:12.833
A... A meetup?

00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:15.292
Not a meetup. A date.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.792
Next time, I also want to...

00:00:18.917 --> 00:00:20.542
hang out with you just like today.

00:00:21.917 --> 00:00:24.250
Oh, is that what you meant?

00:00:24.375 --> 00:00:25.958
You had me worried for a second.

00:00:26.083 --> 00:00:27.125
Sure, I'm down.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.458
But why did you have
to use the word "date"?

00:00:36.708 --> 00:00:39.028
Would it also be nice for
you if I only did this with you?

00:00:44.917 --> 00:00:48.125
I don't like it when you hang
out with other friends by yourself.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.850
And I also don't like it when
you get close to other celebrities.

00:00:51.667 --> 00:00:53.958
I only want to be the one closest to you.

00:00:57.208 --> 00:00:59.848
I've also wondered if you've ever
brought a girlfriend here before.

00:01:00.292 --> 00:01:01.667
You've wondered?

00:01:03.167 --> 00:01:04.625
That's even worse.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.750
It's the absolute...

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.833
You feel bad about canceling
our plans today, right?

00:01:12.583 --> 00:01:13.958
Well...

00:01:14.083 --> 00:01:15.208
Yeah.

00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:17.458
That's why you came all
this way to pick me up...

00:01:17.583 --> 00:01:18.875
Right?

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.458
Yeah.

00:01:21.583 --> 00:01:23.333
That's right.

00:01:23.458 --> 00:01:24.583
That's it.

00:01:25.583 --> 00:01:27.042
Isn't this a date?

00:01:32.833 --> 00:01:34.375
Then should we just start dating?

00:01:35.792 --> 00:01:36.958
Huh?

00:01:41.792 --> 00:01:44.083
"Should we just start dating?"

00:01:46.375 --> 00:01:47.625
What are you doing?

00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:49.875
What?

00:01:50.708 --> 00:01:52.125
It's nothing.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.333
Let's go home.

00:01:57.458 --> 00:01:58.833
Wait!

00:01:59.917 --> 00:02:01.625
Something's definitely up with you.

00:02:01.917 --> 00:02:03.333
No, there isn't.

00:02:03.542 --> 00:02:05.333
I said it's nothing.

00:02:07.083 --> 00:02:08.500
So...

00:02:08.625 --> 00:02:10.333
Someone confessed their feelings to you?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.958
It wasn't really a confession, more like...

00:02:13.083 --> 00:02:14.167
a proposition?

00:02:14.292 --> 00:02:15.583
A proposition?

00:02:16.708 --> 00:02:18.125
Let's just call it a confession.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.000
Fine, a confession.

00:02:20.125 --> 00:02:22.042
So what's the problem?

00:02:22.167 --> 00:02:25.417
Because everything is a problem.
Or is it a problem?

00:02:25.542 --> 00:02:27.042
If you like them, say yes.

00:02:27.167 --> 00:02:29.292
If you don't, say no. It's that simple.

00:02:29.417 --> 00:02:31.792
It's not that simple.

00:02:34.458 --> 00:02:37.750
Then... when they confessed to you,
were you happy or did you hate it?

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.167
When they confessed?

00:02:46.542 --> 00:02:48.250
There's your answer.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.500
Huh?

00:02:50.625 --> 00:02:51.684
The confession was awkward,

00:02:51.708 --> 00:02:54.375
but you don't dislike the person, right?

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.542
Wh-Why would you think that?

00:02:58.667 --> 00:03:02.458
Because if you disliked them, you
wouldn't be agonizing over it like this.

00:03:03.917 --> 00:03:07.125
That's true, but...

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.958
You... You're really something.

00:03:10.083 --> 00:03:12.750
And here I thought it
was something serious.

00:03:12.875 --> 00:03:14.667
Come on, let's go home.

00:03:20.833 --> 00:03:21.417
Hey.

00:03:21.542 --> 00:03:22.375
Hmm?

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.375
You're older than me, right?

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.792
So? Is that why you're calling me "noona"?

00:03:30.125 --> 00:03:31.917
To attract someone older,

00:03:32.042 --> 00:03:33.333
what should I do?

00:03:34.667 --> 00:03:37.208
With older people, you
just have to be direct.

00:03:37.333 --> 00:03:38.125
Direct?

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.875
Just play dumb and go for it.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.080
If they don't like it, they'll
turn you down, right?

00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:53.958
What's wrong with you?

00:03:54.083 --> 00:03:55.500
Are you in debt or something?

00:03:55.625 --> 00:03:57.042
It's nothing like that.

00:03:57.167 --> 00:03:59.375
This is killing me.

00:04:04.333 --> 00:04:06.250
What's going on with you two?

00:04:06.375 --> 00:04:08.667
Why are you sending signals behind my back?

00:04:09.083 --> 00:04:10.292
Me?

00:04:12.708 --> 00:04:14.208
See? There you go again.

00:04:14.333 --> 00:04:15.726
Something's definitely going
on with you two, isn't there?

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.083
I said it's nothing.

00:04:17.208 --> 00:04:19.008
- I was just with Soo-hyun...
- With Soo-hyun?

00:04:19.042 --> 00:04:20.667
I didn't do anything.

00:04:22.792 --> 00:04:24.708
It's just one of those things.

00:04:24.833 --> 00:04:26.167
What kind of thing?

00:04:28.292 --> 00:04:30.000
It's just one of those things.

00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.333
Don't tell me...

00:04:34.417 --> 00:04:35.667
Hey!

00:04:36.083 --> 00:04:37.458
What?

00:04:37.792 --> 00:04:39.292
Are you two dating?

00:04:41.375 --> 00:04:42.583
What is he talking about?

00:04:45.292 --> 00:04:46.708
Explain yourself!

00:04:46.833 --> 00:04:49.250
No way. If Kim Young-woo hears about this,

00:04:49.375 --> 00:04:51.833
the whole company will know.

00:04:52.542 --> 00:04:53.708
What about me?

00:04:53.833 --> 00:04:56.625
I was just being a good listener to you.

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.583
What did I do to deserve this?

00:04:59.917 --> 00:05:00.958
Nothing.

00:05:01.458 --> 00:05:02.833
You did nothing wrong.

00:05:04.333 --> 00:05:07.542
I hope you can resolve
this as quickly as possible.

00:05:13.167 --> 00:05:16.000
Speaking of which, what's with
Kim Young-woo these days?

00:05:16.125 --> 00:05:17.708
I don't know.

00:05:18.875 --> 00:05:20.583
He's been sulking every day lately.

00:05:30.708 --> 00:05:31.917
Here.

00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.583
That's it. From now on, I'm not taking

00:05:35.708 --> 00:05:37.208
anything you give me.

00:05:37.333 --> 00:05:38.417
Oh, really?

00:05:38.542 --> 00:05:40.143
Then all the stuff I've
bought you until now,

00:05:40.167 --> 00:05:41.226
are you going to spit it all out?

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.167
Ah, come on, don't be like that.

00:05:45.375 --> 00:05:47.083
Sorry, I didn't know.

00:05:49.292 --> 00:05:50.500
What?

00:05:51.167 --> 00:05:53.375
I didn't know you liked Soo-hyun.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.167
I don't like her!

00:05:55.292 --> 00:05:57.125
Then what's with this tantrum?

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.292
No, I do. I like her a lot.

00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.208
You said you didn't before...

00:06:06.583 --> 00:06:07.875
So what?

00:06:08.792 --> 00:06:11.542
The more time I spend
with her, the more I like her.

00:06:15.125 --> 00:06:17.083
That's how it is.

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.292
You spend time with someone,
you naturally start to like them.

00:06:21.875 --> 00:06:23.375
That's just how it works.

00:06:31.917 --> 00:06:33.625
What? So that's what this was all about?

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:35.292
You should've just said so.

00:06:35.417 --> 00:06:38.125
Says the guy who ran out
in the middle of our meal.

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.958
That was because I didn't know.

00:06:43.625 --> 00:06:45.667
So who confessed to you?

00:06:45.792 --> 00:06:48.417
Forget it. It's not Soo-hyun.

00:06:48.708 --> 00:06:50.458
Is it someone I know?

00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.434
It's not someone from our company, is it?

00:06:52.458 --> 00:06:53.750
Ah, who could it be?

00:06:53.875 --> 00:06:55.458
I think I know who it is.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.125
First, they're definitely younger than you.

00:07:00.417 --> 00:07:01.292
Also, you,

00:07:01.417 --> 00:07:03.542
seem to like people who are a bit childish.

00:07:03.667 --> 00:07:05.227
Someone who's open with their feelings.

00:07:05.292 --> 00:07:08.042
The type who acts without hesitation.

00:07:08.542 --> 00:07:10.083
And knows how to be cute and charming.

00:07:10.458 --> 00:07:11.750
For example...

00:07:14.375 --> 00:07:15.708
someone like me.

00:07:17.875 --> 00:07:20.417
Hey! Hurry up and pack so we can leave.

00:07:20.542 --> 00:07:21.958
So who is it?

00:07:22.083 --> 00:07:23.083
Tell me.

00:07:23.208 --> 00:07:25.500
- Hurry up!
- Hi everyone!

00:07:25.625 --> 00:07:26.625
Huh?

00:07:26.708 --> 00:07:27.708
Moon Do-ha.

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:29.292
What brings you here?

00:07:29.417 --> 00:07:31.083
You didn't reply, so I came.

00:07:31.708 --> 00:07:32.750
Reply?

00:07:32.875 --> 00:07:34.250
What reply?

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:37.375
The one that Gu Jae-yeon
is supposed to give me?

00:07:38.542 --> 00:07:39.750
I get it now.

00:07:39.875 --> 00:07:41.500
You two are up to something again.

00:07:41.625 --> 00:07:42.667
Right?

00:07:52.083 --> 00:07:53.250
Moon Do-ha.

00:07:56.708 --> 00:07:58.917
Are you just going to
ask me directly like that?

00:07:59.917 --> 00:08:00.917
Why not?

00:08:01.042 --> 00:08:02.500
When else should I ask?

00:08:08.542 --> 00:08:10.708
Just staying as close "brothers"...

00:08:14.458 --> 00:08:16.338
That might be a bit
difficult, don't you think?

00:08:17.625 --> 00:08:20.083
I already want something more.

00:08:25.667 --> 00:08:27.417
I was confused too, honestly.

00:08:27.542 --> 00:08:29.625
But while I was waiting for your answer,

00:08:30.042 --> 00:08:31.625
I became more sure of my feelings.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.833
That thing you're "more sure of"...

00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.500
What does that mean...

00:08:39.125 --> 00:08:40.875
No, never mind.

00:08:49.167 --> 00:08:50.500
Go on, ask.

00:08:52.042 --> 00:08:53.042
It's fine.

00:08:54.583 --> 00:08:58.667
Stop agonizing over it and just date me.

00:08:59.833 --> 00:09:02.208
Honestly, someone at my level...
is a total catch, right?

00:09:03.375 --> 00:09:05.875
I'm young and I make good money.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.292
I'm also talented.

00:09:07.417 --> 00:09:09.257
We're in the same
business, and I don't drink.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.375
For you to say all this about yourself...

00:09:16.083 --> 00:09:17.208
It's...

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.375
What? Why are you smiling?

00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:25.417
And they say once you find someone cute,
it's all over.

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:30.958
Don't tell me you think
you're cute right now.

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:32.792
Hmm?

00:09:33.208 --> 00:09:34.542
Am I not?

00:09:39.167 --> 00:09:40.542
You're right.

00:09:41.292 --> 00:09:42.875
It's over. You're doomed.

00:09:57.625 --> 00:09:59.292
Too close.

00:09:59.417 --> 00:10:00.500
Huh?

00:10:01.917 --> 00:10:03.083
I said [they're] too close.

00:10:03.208 --> 00:10:05.375
Should just throw away
the members and quit?

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:06.625
No way.

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:08.893
Moon Do-ha is only like that
because he's been hurt a lot.

00:10:08.917 --> 00:10:11.250
He really cares about his members.

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:12.292
Well...

00:10:12.417 --> 00:10:13.976
They're all still young, so that's why.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.708
It'll get better with time.

00:10:18.667 --> 00:10:20.000
What do we do?

00:10:20.125 --> 00:10:22.292
I think Gu Jae-yeon turned someone down.

00:10:23.292 --> 00:10:24.833
Is that what happened?

00:10:26.083 --> 00:10:27.542
It wasn't like that...

00:10:28.542 --> 00:10:30.667
Hey! I guessed it right.

00:10:30.792 --> 00:10:33.042
He hangs out with Moon Do-ha every day.

00:10:33.875 --> 00:10:35.458
Would someone in love do that?

00:10:35.583 --> 00:10:39.250
It's nice that our Kim
Young-woo is so open-minded.

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:40.625
Huh?

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:42.917
Was that a compliment?

00:10:43.833 --> 00:10:45.458
You're so dense.

00:10:47.458 --> 00:10:48.458
Huh?

00:10:50.125 --> 00:10:51.250
Wasn't that a compliment?

00:10:54.583 --> 00:10:55.583
Manager.

00:10:56.583 --> 00:10:57.958
What brings you here?

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:03.792
Well... there's something I need to tell
you, but it's a bit difficult to bring up.

00:11:07.083 --> 00:11:07.917
Mr. Gu.

00:11:08.042 --> 00:11:10.250
I know you're a kind and sincere person.

00:11:11.292 --> 00:11:13.708
But Do-ha is a kid
who used to be all about work.

00:11:13.833 --> 00:11:15.708
The CEO is very worried.

00:11:16.792 --> 00:11:18.667
Worried in what way...?

00:11:19.208 --> 00:11:21.851
Well... he used to be the kind of kid
who'd just stay in his dorm after work.

00:11:21.875 --> 00:11:22.893
Now he's always running
off somewhere in his free time.

00:11:22.917 --> 00:11:25.208
He's been going out more at night, too.

00:11:25.333 --> 00:11:26.958
I see the CEO is quite concerned.

00:11:30.375 --> 00:11:32.625
I understand what you mean.

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:35.333
But Do-ha...

00:11:35.458 --> 00:11:37.833
He's brightened up a lot
since meeting you, Mr. Gu.

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:41.083
That's a relief.

00:11:45.625 --> 00:11:49.167
(Incoming call from Moon Do-ha)

00:12:14.792 --> 00:12:16.167
There's no shoot today.

00:12:16.292 --> 00:12:17.833
Are you asleep already?

00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:19.375
Do-ha, go get changed.

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:20.708
Yes, sir.

00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:23.958
"My schedule is set."

00:12:24.083 --> 00:12:25.518
"I'm going to be very busy for a while."

00:12:25.542 --> 00:12:28.042
"I'll be focusing on work from now on."

00:12:30.708 --> 00:12:32.333
Is Gu Jae-yeon that busy lately?

00:12:32.458 --> 00:12:34.250
Yeah, he also took on a new project.

00:12:34.375 --> 00:12:36.458
He's also working as
a martial arts director.

00:12:36.583 --> 00:12:38.167
Busier than an idol.

00:12:38.292 --> 00:12:40.042
So where is he now?

00:12:47.792 --> 00:12:49.167
What are you doing?

00:12:50.375 --> 00:12:52.455
I'm waiting for Gu Jae-yeon,
what does it look like?

00:12:52.792 --> 00:12:55.042
Isn't Moon Do-ha a very busy man?

00:12:55.333 --> 00:12:56.125
That's what I'm saying.

00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:58.750
No, I'm swamped.
So why isn't he coming out?

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:00.667
Gu Jae-yeon!

00:13:03.625 --> 00:13:04.875
Hyung.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.500
Yeah?

00:13:07.208 --> 00:13:09.292
Am I annoying?

00:13:10.667 --> 00:13:12.000
What are you talking about?

00:13:12.125 --> 00:13:14.292
Am I the kind of person
who gets on people's nerves?

00:13:14.417 --> 00:13:16.333
What do you think?

00:13:16.458 --> 00:13:18.208
It's the same thing.

00:13:19.625 --> 00:13:21.208
Am I not charming?

00:13:22.833 --> 00:13:24.833
Same difference. You're charming.

00:13:27.875 --> 00:13:29.625
Why isn't he answering his phone...?

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:31.125
"My schedule is set.

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:33.250
I'm going to be very busy for a while.

00:13:33.375 --> 00:13:35.625
I'll be focusing on work from now on."

00:13:37.125 --> 00:13:38.792
What does this sound like to you guys?

00:13:39.417 --> 00:13:41.417
It doesn't look good.

00:13:41.542 --> 00:13:43.208
So he's rejecting me?

00:13:43.333 --> 00:13:44.917
Yeah, looks like it.

00:13:46.667 --> 00:13:48.976
No, but if he was going to reject
me, he should've just said so.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.833
Why bring up work?

00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:52.559
Isn't this just his way of
letting you down easy?

00:13:52.583 --> 00:13:53.667
Especially that period.

00:13:53.792 --> 00:13:55.250
That period is a little...

00:13:55.375 --> 00:13:56.625
Yeah, the period.

00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:58.851
If that's what he meant,
he should've used like, three of them.

00:13:58.875 --> 00:14:00.750
But there's only one.

00:14:03.125 --> 00:14:04.250
Hyung, what's your take?

00:14:04.375 --> 00:14:05.667
Well...

00:14:05.792 --> 00:14:07.208
I'm not so sure.

00:14:08.708 --> 00:14:10.083
I change my mind.

00:14:10.208 --> 00:14:12.542
It sounds like he really
means to focus on work.

00:14:13.042 --> 00:14:15.667
Right? He must actually be busy.

00:14:16.917 --> 00:14:20.208
Yeah, he must be.

00:14:20.333 --> 00:14:23.542
Why would he beat around
the bush and be confusing?

00:14:23.667 --> 00:14:25.083
It seems he's genuinely busy.

00:14:27.583 --> 00:14:30.250
Speaking of which, I haven't
seen Moon Do-ha around lately.

00:14:30.375 --> 00:14:32.208
I know, right? We used
to see him every day.

00:14:32.333 --> 00:14:33.625
He said he's busy?

00:14:34.167 --> 00:14:36.333
Oh, well...

00:14:36.542 --> 00:14:38.458
Right. He is an idol, after all.

00:14:40.042 --> 00:14:41.292
Where are you going?

00:14:41.417 --> 00:14:42.292
To get some water.

00:14:42.417 --> 00:14:43.250
I'll get it for you.

00:14:43.375 --> 00:14:45.917
Why would you get it for me?

00:14:46.042 --> 00:14:47.476
What? I can get it for you, can't I?

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:49.125
She left without even looking back.

00:14:51.417 --> 00:14:53.125
Do you like Soo-hyun that much?

00:14:54.833 --> 00:14:56.625
Yeah, she's so cool.

00:14:57.292 --> 00:14:59.625
She's the best perk of
working at this company.

00:15:01.333 --> 00:15:02.958
(Moon Do-ha)

00:15:07.333 --> 00:15:08.750
I told him not to contact me.

00:15:08.875 --> 00:15:10.292
What is he doing...?

00:15:14.792 --> 00:15:16.292
Hyung, aren't you watching this?

00:15:16.417 --> 00:15:17.417
What?

00:15:17.542 --> 00:15:20.042
Lots of viewers are leaving comments.

00:15:20.167 --> 00:15:23.250
Everyone must have tuned in
because they're excited for today's guest.

00:15:24.542 --> 00:15:27.792
Alright, today,
we've invited a special guest.

00:15:27.917 --> 00:15:30.083
Let's introduce our guest now.

00:15:30.208 --> 00:15:31.833
Hello, everyone. I'm Moon Do-ha.

00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:34.625
Mr. Moon, it's been a while.

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:35.893
You've been busy, haven't you?

00:15:35.917 --> 00:15:38.667
Yes, I've been swamped.

00:15:39.667 --> 00:15:40.667
To be specific,

00:15:40.708 --> 00:15:42.708
what and where have you been working on?

00:15:42.833 --> 00:15:45.333
A lot of our viewers are very curious.

00:15:45.458 --> 00:15:46.333
Well...

00:15:46.458 --> 00:15:49.250
I've been working hard on set, of course.

00:15:49.375 --> 00:15:50.500
So, Mr. Moon,

00:15:50.625 --> 00:15:52.542
what do you usually do
when you take a break?

00:15:52.833 --> 00:15:55.708
Well... I'll read my script,

00:15:55.833 --> 00:15:58.583
practice my dance moves
so I don't get rusty,

00:15:58.708 --> 00:16:00.167
and rest like that.

00:16:00.292 --> 00:16:01.708
Oh, come on, don't say that.

00:16:01.833 --> 00:16:03.500
What does Mr. Moon do when he's resting?

00:16:03.625 --> 00:16:05.292
Be honest and tell us.

00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:07.083
But...

00:16:07.208 --> 00:16:10.875
I don't really have much experience
with things outside of work.

00:16:12.208 --> 00:16:13.458
Ah, wait.

00:16:16.167 --> 00:16:19.375
Basketball. It's pretty fun.

00:16:21.917 --> 00:16:24.417
I played basketball on my day off recently,

00:16:24.542 --> 00:16:25.625
and I really enjoyed it.

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:27.833
Ah, to be young.

00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:29.351
Are you good at basketball, Mr. Moon?

00:16:29.375 --> 00:16:30.958
I love basketball, too.

00:16:31.833 --> 00:16:33.208
No, it's not me.

00:16:36.417 --> 00:16:38.458
It's because Mr. Gu Jae-yeon likes it.

00:16:39.417 --> 00:16:41.375
I played with Mr. Gu Jae-yeon.

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.833
Ah, Mr. Gu Jae-yeon.
You mean the one who...

00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:45.833
He's your martial arts instructor, right?

00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:46.417
Yes.

00:16:46.542 --> 00:16:50.042
Ah, one moment. Our writer is telling me...

00:16:50.167 --> 00:16:51.833
A phone call? Uh, excuse me,

00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:55.125
can we get Mr. Gu Jae-yeon
on the phone right now?

00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:56.250
Yes, hurry!

00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:58.708
We can do that right this second?

00:17:02.625 --> 00:17:04.875
