(Never Regretted)

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.180
Alright.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.090
Ask whatever you need to quickly.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.860
He only has

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.500
less than half an hour left.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.020
Wen Zhihu.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.660
You did so much for Prince Yu,

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.179
yet he didn't trust you at all.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.060
He killed you without a single question.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.980
Are you still refusing
to testify against him?

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.124
I know

00:01:55.125 --> 00:01:57.125
what you want.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.180
But I will not give it to you.

00:02:02.632 --> 00:02:03.511
If it weren't for you

00:02:03.512 --> 00:02:05.780
scheming to get close to Luo'er,

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.720
how would Prince Yu

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.700
have come to suspect me?

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.220
Xie Yunyan.

00:02:15.737 --> 00:02:17.977
Our whole family was harmed by you.

00:02:18.575 --> 00:02:20.259
I will just watch

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.980
you and Prince Yu destroy each other.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:25.619
It was you,

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.824
you helped the tyrant
and suffered the backlash.

00:02:27.825 --> 00:02:29.785
Why blame others for your sins?

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.420
You are right.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.900
This is my retribution.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.939
Back then,

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.300
Luo'er was frail.

00:02:49.025 --> 00:02:50.825
To beg for medicine,

00:02:51.312 --> 00:02:52.899
I was forced

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.140
to be controlled by Prince Yu.

00:02:55.862 --> 00:02:57.982
Now,

00:03:00.995 --> 00:03:02.674
I have personally

00:03:02.675 --> 00:03:05.555
caused Luo'er's death.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:19.980
How are you?

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.260
I went to check
the Wen family's warehouse,

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.860
but I found the Wen family
had been slaughtered.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.460
I was too late.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.300
I only saved this child.

00:03:41.362 --> 00:03:43.002
I'll go clean up.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:46.980
Brother, Sister...

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.180
Luo'er...

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.060
Luo'er...

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.379
Luo'er, is that you?

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:55.340
Father!

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:57.500
Father!

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:00.970
Luo'er.

00:04:01.937 --> 00:04:03.617
You yet live.

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.220
Are you unharmed?

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:07.620
I am not.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.420
Our entire family

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.540
was slain by those villains.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.540
If not for Big Brother saving me,

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.180
I would not have seen you again, Father.

00:04:24.737 --> 00:04:26.297
Those villains said

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.260
they were sent by Xie Yunyan.

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:37.660
Father,

00:04:37.912 --> 00:04:39.312
we must seek out Xie Yunyan

00:04:39.475 --> 00:04:41.315
and avenge our family.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.820
A fine strategy
to kill two birds with one stone.

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:47.820
Sir Wen,

00:04:48.437 --> 00:04:49.269
even at this hour,

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.682
do you still intend to remain silent?

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:59.260
Very well.

00:05:00.662 --> 00:05:01.862
I shall speak.

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.619
I have long aided Prince Yu
in trafficking illicit salt

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.499
and the wrought iron
used to forge weaponry.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.900
Later,

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.940
General Xiao learned of the ledger.

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:22.539
Prince Yu

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.060
fearing his denouncement,

00:05:25.225 --> 00:05:26.705
then seized the chance

00:05:26.925 --> 00:05:29.685
while the battle
at Linchuan was critical,

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.080
and command me to secretly stand idle,

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.460
then postpone reinforcements,

00:05:34.487 --> 00:05:37.274
which led to the great defeat
of the Xiao army.

00:05:37.275 --> 00:05:38.675
Only a great defeat?

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.620
(He did not intend
to utterly destroy the Xiao family.)

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:45.540
Though

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:49.300
Prince Yu is the Emperor's
most favored younger brother,

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.379
no matter how audacious he is,

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.620
he would not dare to undermine
the foundation of the nation.

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.700
The secret correspondence
between Prince Yu and me,

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.420
as well as the ledger of smuggled goods,

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.900
I hid them

00:06:13.287 --> 00:06:15.807
in the secret compartment of my study.

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:26.820
Luo'er,

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.940
you must live well.

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:40.820
Father!

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:52.220
Father,

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:53.780
don't worry.

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:58.180
I will avenge you.

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:14.700
Are you still thinking about Wen Luo?

00:07:18.837 --> 00:07:20.237
Do you remember

00:07:20.262 --> 00:07:21.782
I told you

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:24.180
I have a lost younger brother?

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:26.420
I remember.

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:31.660
His name is Su Jinle,

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:33.220
and his childhood name is also Luo.

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:35.659
He was only four

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:36.860
when he went missing.

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:38.860
If we calculate it,

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:40.820
he should be about
the same age as Wen Luo.

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:44.300
I wonder

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:46.700
what he looks like now.

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:52.900
Young Master.

00:07:55.162 --> 00:07:58.270
(Ordered to secretly investigate Su Jinle's whereabouts.
Have confirmed his death.)

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.300
Should we tell Young Madam

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:07.220
about Luo's death in Danzhou?

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:16.900
No, let's not.

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:27.060
Yuan,

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:29.700
don't be too sad.

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:31.460
Luo must have

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:34.060
met some good people,

00:08:34.262 --> 00:08:35.336
and he must

00:08:35.337 --> 00:08:36.897
be living very well.

00:08:49.487 --> 00:08:50.887
Do you still remember

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:52.339
when I wrote to you before,

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:53.540
I promised you

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:55.980
I'd take you to see
the scenery outside the capital?

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:01.060
Before we return to the capital,

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:03.140
let's go relax in Xianyang,

00:09:03.962 --> 00:09:04.962
just the two of us.

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:21.180
It was clearly supposed to be
just the two of us.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.099
This Xi Junning

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:24.340
is so annoying.

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:33.540
Look at them.

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:41.099
Little Yuan,

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:43.982
I heard that the fried silkworm pupae here
in Xianyang are superb.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.420
I tried them once
when I was practicing medicine here.

00:09:46.525 --> 00:09:47.405
Let's go eat them.

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:49.700
Xi Junning.

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:51.699
Yuan is a young woman.

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:53.286
How is it appropriate to pull her around

00:09:53.287 --> 00:09:54.647
on the street?

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:56.957
Actually, Ning...

00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:59.220
Young Master Xie,

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:01.660
you couldn't be jealous, could you?

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:08.060
You are not allowed to tell him.
I finally managed to embarrass him.

00:10:08.612 --> 00:10:09.520
Come on,

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:11.420
let's go.

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:16.340
Go.

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:22.539
Master,

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:23.659
what would you and your wife

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:24.939
like to eat?

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:26.099
I...

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:28.180
They are not husband and wife.

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:30.561
My apologies.

00:10:30.562 --> 00:10:32.059
I misjudged you two.

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:33.099
I wish you happiness.

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:34.100
Please.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.760
Let's go.

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:38.699
Your Sixth Brother

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:39.700
is quite amusing.

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:41.157
You are not allowed to tell him either.

00:10:42.635 --> 00:10:44.074
It's good to tease him a bit,

00:10:44.075 --> 00:10:45.074
lest he

00:10:45.075 --> 00:10:46.355
remains burdened by sorrow.

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:52.059
Shopkeeper.

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:53.860
- Fried silkworm pupae.
- Coming right up.

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:55.820
Please enjoy.

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:00.820
It smells delicious.

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:02.140
Here, Little Yuan.

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:06.520
Xi Junning.

00:11:06.875 --> 00:11:08.182
What are you doing?

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:12.149
Young Master Xie, you eat.

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:13.140
I...

00:11:16.412 --> 00:11:17.532
Xiao Yunxi.

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:24.940
Is it good?

00:11:36.462 --> 00:11:37.662
It's so beautiful.

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:39.139
Let's go take a look.

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:39.900
Let's go.

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:31.500
Yuan,

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:33.740
after this matter is settled,

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:36.860
I want to tell Grandmother and Mother
about our relationship.

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:41.260
With Yunxi's help,

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:43.180
and having Mother
accept you as a goddaughter,

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:45.536
I will also request a marriage decree

00:12:45.537 --> 00:12:47.057
from the Emperor.

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:49.620
I know

00:12:50.175 --> 00:12:51.699
even with all of this,

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:52.979
you will still suffer greatly

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:54.580
by following me.

00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:58.120
I don't suffer.

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:03.419
I would only suffer

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:04.780
if you didn't love me.

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:10.140
Being with you,

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:11.895
I hesitated,

00:13:12.025 --> 00:13:13.665
but I have never regretted it.

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:16.980
Only after we were together
did I realize

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:19.700
that this life

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:21.540
was not lived in vain.

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:39.340
Heaven has been so kind to me.

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:46.460
