00:55.305 --> 00:58.892
My word! What is going on out there?

01:25.376 --> 01:27.504
Good afternoon, students.

01:27.629 --> 01:30.131
Classes have been canceled
for the rest of the day.

01:30.632 --> 01:33.593
Upperclassmen are excused,
but all other students,

01:33.676 --> 01:37.055
please report to the auditorium
for an all-school assembly.

01:43.061 --> 01:44.938
Who do you think
would have the ugliest baby?

01:45.771 --> 01:47.398
Burt the Turtle and Teddy Yurin.

01:48.274 --> 01:50.443
What about Lilly Bainbridge
and that Matty guy?

01:50.527 --> 01:52.277
That's so gross.

01:52.362 --> 01:54.739
My parents...

01:59.953 --> 02:01.121
Where are all the teachers?

02:11.631 --> 02:13.883
Settle down, students. Settle down.

02:14.926 --> 02:17.262
We have a special treat today

02:17.345 --> 02:20.473
designed to entertain and delight.

02:21.808 --> 02:26.020
Please allow me to introduce
the one and only...

02:26.521 --> 02:29.149
Pennywise the Dancing Clown!

02:30.608 --> 02:31.860
Hiya, kiddos!

02:39.826 --> 02:41.119
Ta-da!

02:58.678 --> 03:01.139
When I close my eyes

03:01.222 --> 03:03.433
And I dream of you

03:04.058 --> 03:08.563
I see your pretty faces
And I taste them too

03:08.646 --> 03:11.065
But my, oh my

03:11.149 --> 03:14.152
How I wish to cry

03:14.611 --> 03:17.822
Every time we say

03:17.906 --> 03:24.454
Goodbye!

05:45.053 --> 05:46.095
Guys.

06:15.291 --> 06:16.292
Guys.

06:32.475 --> 06:33.518
Shit.

06:34.769 --> 06:36.229
It's all the kids from school.

06:37.688 --> 06:39.107
It's messing with us, right?

06:40.066 --> 06:41.984
It can't have taken all of them.

06:42.068 --> 06:43.903
Only one way to find out.

06:43.986 --> 06:45.029
Let's go.

07:48.342 --> 07:49.677
Who is that?

07:50.928 --> 07:52.096
I don't wanna know.

07:56.476 --> 07:57.477
They're gone!

07:58.019 --> 08:00.438
Everyone. Everyone-- Everyone's gone exc--

08:02.398 --> 08:03.399
-Oh my God!
-Oh my God!

08:03.483 --> 08:05.735
It's Dunleavy. No, no.
That's Principal Dunleavy.

08:05.818 --> 08:06.944
-Uh-huh.
-Wh... why?

08:08.154 --> 08:09.197
Wait.

08:09.280 --> 08:12.408
How can it have taken all of them? How?

08:18.498 --> 08:19.540
Guys.

08:21.375 --> 08:23.336
No. No, no.

08:23.419 --> 08:25.546
It-- It took Will.

08:25.630 --> 08:27.089
Took him? Took him where?

08:29.800 --> 08:31.969
Probably wherever that leads.

08:32.053 --> 08:33.095
So what do we do?

08:33.179 --> 08:34.847
We have to follow the trail,

08:34.931 --> 08:37.558
and we can use the dagger thing
to protect ourselves.

08:37.642 --> 08:39.684
I mean, we have to try
and save our friend.

08:40.311 --> 08:42.563
I wanna kill that fucking clown.

08:43.272 --> 08:44.482
Let's go.

08:48.945 --> 08:50.071
Go!

08:53.533 --> 08:55.159
Stop squirming.

08:55.243 --> 08:56.327
I'm falling.

08:56.410 --> 08:58.037
You weren't falling on the way over!

08:58.663 --> 09:01.165
Guys, we're never gonna
catch up to them at this rate.

09:01.249 --> 09:02.959
Do you have a better idea?

09:04.961 --> 09:05.962
Oh, shit!

09:06.087 --> 09:08.756
Oh, the milkman.

09:19.892 --> 09:21.435
What are you doing?

09:25.273 --> 09:26.607
You don't know how to drive!

09:26.691 --> 09:28.776
Neither do you. I mean, do you?

09:28.859 --> 09:30.903
No. But you've only got one eye.

09:30.987 --> 09:32.738
It's fine. My uncle Mike has a truck.

09:32.822 --> 09:34.323
And he let you drive it?

09:34.407 --> 09:35.408
No.

09:36.492 --> 09:37.618
But I watched him.

10:00.808 --> 10:02.393
Come on, son. Pick up, please.

10:05.062 --> 10:06.188
Pick up the fucking phone.

10:07.231 --> 10:08.441
Pick up, Will. Come on.

10:12.820 --> 10:13.863
Shit.

10:19.869 --> 10:21.912
Hello? Will?

10:24.206 --> 10:25.207
Will?

10:30.546 --> 10:31.547
Who is this?

10:32.757 --> 10:36.552
What scares the man without fear?

10:38.971 --> 10:40.640
-You.
-Oh, no.

10:40.723 --> 10:42.600
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

10:42.683 --> 10:43.726
Us.

10:44.226 --> 10:46.354
Where am I? Hello?

10:47.271 --> 10:49.231
-Anybody?
-Will.

10:49.315 --> 10:51.484
Will, I'm here, son. Will, I'm here.

10:51.567 --> 10:53.903
Hello? Please, I'm scared.

10:53.986 --> 10:55.112
Oh, yes. You are.

10:55.196 --> 10:56.864
Will, don't be scared. Listen, I'm here.

10:56.947 --> 10:59.283
You just need to tell me where you are.
Okay, son?

10:59.367 --> 11:00.368
Tell me--

11:01.077 --> 11:02.078
Hello?

11:03.245 --> 11:04.246
Will!

11:05.706 --> 11:08.834
-Will!
-Back in the wagon for Willie boy!

11:08.918 --> 11:10.920
Gotta keep him nice and fresh.

11:11.003 --> 11:14.131
-Listen, please.
-The dark meat tastes twice as sweet!

11:14.215 --> 11:16.300
Don't put your hands on my son!

11:16.384 --> 11:20.429
Don't touch my son, you hear me?
I'll rip your fucking heart out!

11:21.013 --> 11:22.139
Don't touch my s--

11:23.224 --> 11:24.225
Hello?

11:25.267 --> 11:26.268
Will!

12:04.181 --> 12:05.349
Leave me alone.

12:12.064 --> 12:14.233
Dick! Dick, open up!

12:16.277 --> 12:17.570
Dick!

12:20.614 --> 12:21.782
-Dick!
-Shut up.

12:23.117 --> 12:24.201
Do it, Dick!

12:26.829 --> 12:29.081
-Dick, open up. I can hear you.
-Do it!

12:31.876 --> 12:33.085
This is your last chance!

12:33.169 --> 12:35.212
Join us!

12:35.296 --> 12:36.922
-Do it!
-Do it!

12:37.715 --> 12:38.883
I am coming in!

12:41.427 --> 12:43.262
No. No, don't.

12:43.345 --> 12:45.306
Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't.

12:45.389 --> 12:46.682
What the hell is going on?

12:47.183 --> 12:50.060
-Dick, what are you doing?
-I can't take it no more.

12:50.144 --> 12:51.937
Okay, but listen to me, brother.

12:52.021 --> 12:53.063
They won't...

12:54.190 --> 12:55.191
shut up.

12:56.692 --> 12:58.486
Shut up.

12:58.569 --> 13:00.112
Shut up!

13:01.197 --> 13:04.700
You shut up. Shut up.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.577
Dick, we don't have time
for this, brother.

13:06.660 --> 13:08.662
-Dick, I need you.
-Back up!

13:08.746 --> 13:10.623
-Easy, brother.
-No!

13:10.706 --> 13:12.792
-Easy.
-You did this.

13:14.293 --> 13:16.003
You did it.

13:16.712 --> 13:19.215
-I'm sorry.
-You got my mind all fucked up.

13:19.298 --> 13:21.217
I'm sorry. I just--
I need you to listen to me.

13:21.300 --> 13:22.301
And now...

13:22.843 --> 13:25.012
-there ain't no other way, brother.
-I need you to listen to me.

13:25.095 --> 13:26.597
There ain't no other way.

13:26.680 --> 13:28.682
Dick, please! Please, it's got Will!

13:29.892 --> 13:31.060
It's got Will!

13:33.103 --> 13:35.856
It's got my boy, and I don't know where.

13:35.940 --> 13:37.775
I don't know where he is.

13:37.858 --> 13:41.612
So I'm-- I'm ask-- I'm begging you.

13:42.863 --> 13:45.324
I'm begging you
to please help me find him,

13:45.407 --> 13:47.785
and I swear on my life

13:47.868 --> 13:50.037
that I will do everything in my power--

13:50.996 --> 13:53.207
I will do everything in my-- Look at me!

13:53.290 --> 13:56.126
I'll do everything in my power
to help you.

13:57.211 --> 13:59.338
I promise you
I'll pull the trigger myself.

14:02.633 --> 14:03.884
Please, just...

14:07.555 --> 14:09.265
help me find my baby, please.

14:12.184 --> 14:14.603
Help me find my baby, please.

15:00.232 --> 15:03.986
General, I just received word
that Major Hanlon has gone AWOL.

15:04.069 --> 15:05.696
Forced his way through the guard gate.

15:06.363 --> 15:07.448
We don't need him anymore.

15:08.866 --> 15:10.951
There's nothing he can do to stop us now.

15:11.994 --> 15:14.788
Apparently, there was another airman
with him in the car.

15:15.456 --> 15:16.665
Hallorann.

15:33.849 --> 15:35.225
-Come on, Dick. Come on.
-Cold.

15:35.309 --> 15:37.311
-I know. Come on.
-It's too cold here.

15:38.187 --> 15:39.688
-Come on.
-It's too cold.

15:46.570 --> 15:48.572
What? What?

15:49.281 --> 15:51.450
You said we'd be safe here!

15:51.533 --> 15:53.327
You said we'd be safe here.

15:53.410 --> 15:55.788
-You said--
-I'm sorry.

15:55.871 --> 15:58.207
-You lied to me, Leroy. You're a liar!
-I know.

15:58.290 --> 15:59.875
I'mma get him-- I know. I'm sorry.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.669
-But, Charlotte, listen to me.
-I can't take this.

16:01.752 --> 16:03.462
-I'm gonna get him back.
-I'll call you back, John.

16:03.504 --> 16:05.631
-Bullshit!
-I swear to God, I will get Will back.

16:05.714 --> 16:07.299
-I will get Will back.
-My baby.

16:07.383 --> 16:09.343
Dick-- Dick is gonna help us.

16:09.426 --> 16:12.429
How is he gonna help us?
How are you gonna help us?

16:12.513 --> 16:14.682
-How are you gonna help us?
-Listen, listen to me. Listen.

16:15.599 --> 16:18.394
He said that the bond
between mother and son

16:18.477 --> 16:21.230
is the strongest in this world.
The strongest.

16:21.313 --> 16:23.482
So if you can just-- just connect,

16:23.565 --> 16:25.025
just-- just connect for a second.

16:25.109 --> 16:26.151
It won't matter.

16:27.319 --> 16:28.445
Excuse me?

16:29.989 --> 16:32.074
Even if he locates your son,

16:32.157 --> 16:34.410
you won't stand a chance
against this creature.

16:34.493 --> 16:36.996
-You do realize that.
-What are we supposed to do?

16:37.871 --> 16:38.998
Just give up on our boy?

16:39.665 --> 16:40.749
Of course not.

16:45.379 --> 16:46.505
But if Mr. Hallorann...

16:47.381 --> 16:49.550
could do for us
what he did for your general,

16:49.633 --> 16:53.178
there may be a way to stop this thing
and save your son.

16:53.262 --> 16:54.471
How?

16:55.931 --> 16:59.601
By using his ability
to find one last artifact.

17:02.104 --> 17:03.147
The dagger.

17:04.772 --> 17:06.108
What dagger?

17:07.943 --> 17:10.612
So if this dagger
is made of the same rock,

17:10.695 --> 17:13.991
we can use it to replace a pillar
and re-lock the cage.

17:14.074 --> 17:16.577
Exactly. And, hopefully, save your son.

17:17.493 --> 17:21.123
If Mr. Hallorann can find it
before the creature reaches this point.

17:22.374 --> 17:25.252
On the southern bank of the river,
there's a great pine.

17:26.837 --> 17:30.132
A deadwood that has stood there
since before even our ancestors.

17:30.215 --> 17:31.675
It's the furthest point

17:31.759 --> 17:34.678
that the dagger's energy can still
connect with the other pillars...

17:35.220 --> 17:37.681
-and restore the cage.
-Yeah, that's the southern bank.

17:37.765 --> 17:39.183
That's the shortest route
across the river,

17:39.308 --> 17:40.893
probably where that thing
will try to cross it.

17:40.976 --> 17:44.438
How do we connect the dagger's energy
to the other pillars?

17:44.521 --> 17:47.149
The earth is a conductor.

17:47.232 --> 17:49.902
The dagger needs to be buried
just as the other pillars were.

17:51.528 --> 17:52.654
It's our only hope.

17:53.155 --> 17:54.865
You're a bunch of goddamn fools.

17:56.784 --> 17:59.203
I can barely hear myself think.

17:59.828 --> 18:02.581
And now y'all expecting me
to find your little dagger?

18:09.797 --> 18:12.508
I can help you quiet the voices
in your head, Mr. Hallorann.

18:13.383 --> 18:15.469
But you're going to have to trust me.

18:17.387 --> 18:18.388
How?

18:33.278 --> 18:36.323
You need to be connected
to the dagger's energy.

18:36.406 --> 18:38.075
This is made from Maturin root.

18:39.159 --> 18:42.204
It will connect you to all things
in the realm this evil came from.

18:42.287 --> 18:45.082
But not all things there are evil.

18:46.166 --> 18:48.377
This tea is gonna shut
all these voices up?

18:49.628 --> 18:52.798
When one door in the mind opens,
another must close.

19:00.848 --> 19:01.932
How long is it gonna take?

19:02.599 --> 19:03.600
Not long.

19:05.060 --> 19:06.061
Remember this.

19:06.603 --> 19:09.606
Whatever you do, do not go...

19:43.140 --> 19:44.850
You have to drive faster, Marge.

19:44.933 --> 19:47.060
It's a fucking milk truck.
I'm going as fast as I can.

19:47.144 --> 19:48.353
Well, step on it, okay?

19:48.437 --> 19:50.772
-I'm trying!
-We have to catch up to it or we may be--

19:50.856 --> 19:52.107
Pothole!

20:07.664 --> 20:08.957
Are you guys okay?

20:09.041 --> 20:10.667
Marge, what the hell?

20:10.751 --> 20:13.837
That wasn't a one-eye thing.
It was a pothole thing.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.179
What's wrong?

20:23.096 --> 20:24.848
Oh, jeepers, Lilly,
you have blood on your face.

20:24.932 --> 20:27.017
-Are you okay?
-The dagger, where is it?

20:27.726 --> 20:29.228
We have to find it. We have to.

20:29.311 --> 20:31.188
We will. It's got to be here somewhere.

20:33.440 --> 20:34.733
There it is!

20:36.276 --> 20:38.195
No! No, don't touch it!

20:38.278 --> 20:39.738
I can get it myself.

20:39.821 --> 20:40.989
Why are you snapping at her like--

20:41.073 --> 20:42.282
Just shut up, Ronnie.

20:43.075 --> 20:44.284
Just stop.

20:45.869 --> 20:48.247
Guys, we don't have time.
We have to keep going.

21:05.889 --> 21:07.099
-Stay with it, Mr. Hallorann.
-Hey.

21:07.182 --> 21:08.725
-Stay with it.
-Ah! The dagger!

21:09.893 --> 21:10.894
I see it.

21:10.978 --> 21:12.354
Where? Where is it?

21:12.437 --> 21:13.981
Will's friends. Will's friends.

21:14.064 --> 21:15.941
-What? Ronnie?
-The girls.

21:16.024 --> 21:17.276
They-- They have it.

21:17.359 --> 21:20.320
-Ronnie, my ba-- My baby, Ronnie?
-They're fighting over it.

21:22.531 --> 21:23.657
They're going after--

21:24.533 --> 21:25.993
They're going after Will.

21:26.076 --> 21:28.328
He'll help us find him,
but we've gotta go now!

21:33.875 --> 21:34.876
Okay.

21:40.132 --> 21:41.550
Let's go.

21:51.601 --> 21:52.769
I can't see too good.

21:53.478 --> 21:55.230
Are you sure we're going the right way?

21:56.857 --> 21:58.191
We're getting closer.

21:58.692 --> 22:01.778
I don't understand.
If the dagger's power is real,

22:01.862 --> 22:04.239
why wouldn't my daughter
and her friends be safe?

22:04.323 --> 22:08.118
The dagger is a lost fragment
of the comet that this thing arrived on,

22:08.660 --> 22:11.330
taken from where it crashed down
beneath Neibolt House.

22:11.955 --> 22:14.875
Like all lost things,
it just wants to go home.

22:15.709 --> 22:17.919
The further you take it
from where it belongs,

22:19.254 --> 22:21.048
the more damage it does to your mind.

22:22.049 --> 22:23.258
It drives you insane.

22:23.800 --> 22:25.093
The dagger will resist.

22:26.511 --> 22:31.099
It will fight back with a force
that you cannot imagine.

22:49.451 --> 22:51.536
Something's wrong with that thing.

22:54.873 --> 22:56.792
Why are you looking at me like that?

22:58.919 --> 23:01.171
-We're not looking at you any--
-Yes, you are.

23:02.047 --> 23:03.924
You're looking at me
like you think I'm crazy.

23:04.007 --> 23:07.135
Lilly, why don't you
just give us the dagger?

23:07.636 --> 23:08.720
Just for a little bit.

23:09.763 --> 23:11.556
You never trusted me, did you?

23:12.557 --> 23:13.892
You just used me!

23:14.559 --> 23:16.436
You used me to save your stupid dad!

23:16.520 --> 23:18.105
-Hey!
-And you used me 'cause you lost

23:18.188 --> 23:20.190
all your other stupid friends!

23:38.792 --> 23:40.168
I have to go back!

23:40.752 --> 23:43.380
I'm gonna get us all killed,
don't you get it?

23:43.463 --> 23:44.965
Ronnie was right about me!

23:45.048 --> 23:46.299
No, I wasn't!

23:47.843 --> 23:49.970
Lilly! Please, stop it!

23:50.053 --> 23:52.681
This thing is making you think
these things!

23:52.764 --> 23:55.559
I'm gonna drag you all under,
don't you see?

23:55.642 --> 23:58.770
-I am!
-No, you're not! Lilly!

23:58.854 --> 24:01.982
This is not you! Listen to me, okay?

24:02.065 --> 24:04.776
You are a goddamn lifeboat!

24:30.051 --> 24:31.928
Ron, Marge, I'm--

24:33.597 --> 24:35.140
I'm so sorry.

24:36.975 --> 24:40.270
Don't be. It wasn't really you.

24:43.523 --> 24:45.901
We trade off who holds
this thing as we go.

24:46.651 --> 24:47.652
Okay?

24:56.828 --> 24:58.580
Oh, what the fu--

25:10.592 --> 25:12.177
Guys?

25:31.905 --> 25:32.906
Look.

25:36.326 --> 25:37.744
You think Will is in there?

25:39.037 --> 25:40.121
Let's find out.

25:50.173 --> 25:51.716
-Jesus!
-What's wrong?

25:52.342 --> 25:55.720
All of those kids... floating on ice.

25:57.597 --> 25:58.807
Ice?

25:58.890 --> 26:00.100
The kids?

26:00.183 --> 26:01.851
Oh my God, it's already on the river.

26:03.103 --> 26:04.437
We're not gonna make it.

26:04.521 --> 26:06.523
We won't get to the kids in time.

26:06.606 --> 26:08.775
Not before it passes the deadwood.

26:08.858 --> 26:10.569
I see it. I can see it...

26:11.570 --> 26:12.862
the clown.

26:15.031 --> 26:16.157
We can slow it down.

26:16.241 --> 26:17.742
Uh, how are we gonna do that?

26:18.368 --> 26:20.453
Dick has gotten
into this thing's head before.

26:21.580 --> 26:22.747
In the helicopter.

26:22.831 --> 26:24.207
Dick. Dick.

26:24.708 --> 26:28.044
Can you do it again? Can you try? Dick!

26:55.697 --> 26:57.449
There he is! Will!

26:58.992 --> 27:00.910
Oh, Will! Oh, Will!

27:02.746 --> 27:03.872
Please, Will!

27:05.790 --> 27:07.125
Will! Will!

27:09.044 --> 27:10.045
Try to pull him down.

27:23.391 --> 27:28.938
Look who decided to join the circus!

27:33.276 --> 27:34.778
The fool!

27:35.445 --> 27:36.863
The freak!

27:37.822 --> 27:39.908
The failure!

27:42.827 --> 27:45.038
But who is who?

27:46.456 --> 27:48.041
It doesn't matter.

27:48.124 --> 27:50.543
There's a spot for you all!

28:14.025 --> 28:15.443
Where is he?

28:19.823 --> 28:21.324
Where is he?

28:35.630 --> 28:38.049
-Lilly, no! Stay close!
-Where did she go?

28:48.560 --> 28:51.813
Oh, I've always wondered how you'd taste,

28:51.896 --> 28:53.690
Margaret Tozier.

28:56.651 --> 28:57.652
Tozier?

28:58.194 --> 29:00.697
Oh, but not yet.

29:00.780 --> 29:02.991
You're not Tozier yet.

29:03.074 --> 29:05.910
First comes love,

29:05.994 --> 29:07.954
then comes marriage,

29:08.037 --> 29:12.000
then comes Richie in the baby carriage!

29:13.877 --> 29:15.044
Unless...

29:15.545 --> 29:17.881
Unless he dies with you!

29:17.964 --> 29:19.883
I don't know what you're talking about!

29:23.762 --> 29:25.013
Your son!

29:26.264 --> 29:29.851
Don't you recognize your little boy?

29:32.145 --> 29:34.731
The seed of your stinking loins

29:34.814 --> 29:39.652
and his filthy friends bring me my death!

29:41.196 --> 29:44.073
Or is it birth?

29:44.574 --> 29:46.493
I get confused.

29:46.576 --> 29:48.411
Tomorrow? Yesterday?

29:48.495 --> 29:51.706
It's all the same for little Pennywise.

29:54.501 --> 29:56.836
But it's not always easy. No.

29:57.378 --> 30:02.550
Being caged up in one place, one time.

30:03.551 --> 30:05.929
They can't fence me in.

30:06.471 --> 30:07.639
Not them!

30:08.139 --> 30:10.475
And not you.

30:12.852 --> 30:15.271
Beep-beep, Margie.

30:32.580 --> 30:33.581
Marge!

30:36.876 --> 30:39.254
-What happened?
-I don't know.

30:44.133 --> 30:46.177
Will! Will!

30:47.303 --> 30:48.471
You're alive!

30:49.472 --> 30:50.473
What happened?

30:56.896 --> 30:57.897
Ice?

30:57.981 --> 30:59.732
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

31:10.994 --> 31:12.245
Will!

31:12.328 --> 31:13.371
-Dad? Dad!
-Son!

31:13.454 --> 31:14.455
-Ronnie!
-Son!

31:14.539 --> 31:15.540
-Dad!
-You're okay.

31:15.623 --> 31:17.000
-Daddy! Daddy!
-Are you okay?

31:17.083 --> 31:18.543
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

31:18.626 --> 31:20.211
It's okay. Go over there
with your mother, okay?

31:20.295 --> 31:21.421
-Go. Let's go. Go, go.
-Mom's here?

31:21.504 --> 31:23.006
The clown, it's here,
and it almost ate Marge!

31:23.089 --> 31:25.425
Okay, calm down. Let's get to the van.
Let's get to the van. Come on.

31:25.508 --> 31:26.843
Where's the dagger? Where's the dagger?

31:27.010 --> 31:28.344
-It's here!
-Go, go, go!

31:28.428 --> 31:29.512
To the north shore! Let's go!

31:29.637 --> 31:31.723
Wake up! Wake up! To the north shore!

31:31.806 --> 31:32.891
Oh, baby!

31:39.731 --> 31:41.024
Deadwood's that way, yeah?

31:41.649 --> 31:42.692
On the south bank.

31:43.192 --> 31:45.320
Rose said the dagger's gonna
try to resist.

31:45.403 --> 31:46.613
We're going together.

32:17.894 --> 32:19.687
-No!
-Dad!

32:20.813 --> 32:22.023
-Dad!
-Will!

32:22.106 --> 32:23.107
Come-- Come back!

32:24.108 --> 32:27.278
Ronnie! Ronnie! Ronnie!

32:28.071 --> 32:30.740
Oh, shit! Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh--

32:32.283 --> 32:33.326
Rose!

32:57.976 --> 32:59.936
Okay. Be still.

33:00.019 --> 33:03.064
Tan-- Taniel. Look at me. Still. Still.

33:03.147 --> 33:04.607
Breathe. Breathe.

33:05.108 --> 33:06.317
Taniel.

33:06.401 --> 33:08.444
Taniel? Taniel?

33:09.654 --> 33:10.655
Sh-- Fuck.

33:11.447 --> 33:13.324
Dad! Dad!

33:17.745 --> 33:19.205
I'm okay. I'm okay.

33:19.288 --> 33:20.415
-But why--
-Listen. Listen.

33:20.498 --> 33:22.000
-You take this dagger.
-What?

33:22.083 --> 33:23.376
You take it. You take it.

33:23.459 --> 33:26.254
And you hide in the fog,
and you use it for cover.

33:26.379 --> 33:28.381
Take the dagger. Take it to that tree.

33:28.464 --> 33:30.258
And you bury it deep in the base.

33:30.341 --> 33:31.718
Secure Major Hanlon.

33:32.719 --> 33:34.595
And don't let Hallorann get away.

33:39.225 --> 33:40.893
And that thing, it goes to sleep,

33:40.977 --> 33:42.603
and all of this stops. You understand me?

33:42.687 --> 33:43.938
-I can't.
-Yes, you can.

33:44.022 --> 33:45.648
-No.
-Why not?

33:46.858 --> 33:47.900
I'm scared.

33:51.446 --> 33:52.447
I'm not you.

33:53.865 --> 33:56.576
Listen. You don't have to be.
You understand?

33:56.659 --> 33:59.037
You don't have to be me,
and I don't want you to be.

33:59.120 --> 34:00.329
You just be you.

34:01.330 --> 34:02.331
You hear me?

34:03.207 --> 34:04.333
I love you, son.

34:05.001 --> 34:06.294
I love you.

34:10.465 --> 34:12.925
Go, son. Go. Go. Go!

34:13.509 --> 34:14.677
Come on. Let's go.

34:24.771 --> 34:25.897
Go get Hallorann.

34:56.594 --> 34:57.762
Bob! Bob!

34:59.347 --> 35:00.556
Bob!

35:04.769 --> 35:05.853
Bob!

35:07.688 --> 35:09.023
Bob!

35:09.107 --> 35:10.608
Are you okay, friend?

35:11.234 --> 35:12.944
Papa, Papa, you're all right.

35:17.990 --> 35:19.033
Where am I?

35:19.742 --> 35:20.743
What is this?

35:20.827 --> 35:22.912
You need to lay off the spirits, Robert.

35:23.412 --> 35:25.414
I found you out yonder in a ditch.

35:25.498 --> 35:27.542
You look like you took a nasty fall.

35:28.668 --> 35:30.086
I'm not Bob Gray.

35:30.628 --> 35:33.923
Well, who else might you be,
then? Peter Rabbit?

35:34.006 --> 35:37.135
-Don't you dare speak to me that way!
-Daddy!

35:37.218 --> 35:40.972
I am a god! An eater of worlds!

35:43.432 --> 35:47.270
Must have hit your head a little harder
than you thought there, didn't you, Bob?

35:47.353 --> 35:49.272
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

35:51.816 --> 35:52.942
Did they see us?

35:53.526 --> 35:55.278
I don't know, but where the hell are we?

35:55.361 --> 35:56.654
I can't see a goddamn thing.

35:56.737 --> 35:58.281
I thought they're supposed
to be the good guys.

35:58.364 --> 35:59.949
Why would they kill that man?

36:00.032 --> 36:03.494
Guys, it's okay.
All right, just stay calm.

36:03.578 --> 36:05.329
We just gotta come
from the far side of the tree

36:05.413 --> 36:06.956
so those guys don't spot us first.

36:17.758 --> 36:20.094
I wanna know what the hell
you think you're doing out here.

36:20.178 --> 36:22.096
The kids, where are they headed?

36:22.722 --> 36:23.931
Answer me, Major!

36:25.099 --> 36:27.476
If you don't talk to me,
you're in a world of hurt, son.

36:44.994 --> 36:46.913
There it is. That's the tree.

36:47.663 --> 36:48.748
Let's go.

37:04.555 --> 37:06.349
-I can't do this.
-What?

37:06.432 --> 37:08.059
What are you talking about?

37:09.268 --> 37:10.269
It won't let me.

37:11.312 --> 37:12.480
It's the dagger.

37:15.191 --> 37:17.235
No! No, Will!

37:17.318 --> 37:18.819
-Stop!
-It wants to go home!

37:18.903 --> 37:21.072
-I have to bring it home!
-Don't listen to it!

37:21.155 --> 37:22.698
You have to let it go!

37:22.782 --> 37:24.367
Please, just give it to us!

37:49.600 --> 37:51.060
Just give it to us!

37:51.143 --> 37:52.812
Just-- Just let us help you, Will.

37:52.895 --> 37:55.564
-We can end this.
-We can end it together!

37:55.648 --> 37:56.857
Help me turn around.

38:04.824 --> 38:08.869
All these years,
wondering if you were real,

38:08.953 --> 38:10.788
or just a little boy's nightmare.

38:11.872 --> 38:13.332
Look at you.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.084
You're both.

38:15.960 --> 38:17.962
I don't know if you can hear me in there.

38:19.171 --> 38:21.007
But whatever Hallorann's done to you,

38:21.090 --> 38:22.216
we're gonna fix it.

38:24.260 --> 38:25.428
Show me your hands!

38:27.388 --> 38:28.764
No! Wait!

38:46.365 --> 38:49.160
Tricky, tricky...

38:49.910 --> 38:51.537
Dicky!

38:51.620 --> 38:53.164
Who's Dicky, Bob?

38:55.583 --> 38:59.128
I'm not...

38:59.211 --> 39:00.254
Bob!

39:07.511 --> 39:08.679
Tricky Dicky, Dicky.

39:08.763 --> 39:10.848
Hey! Hey!

39:12.308 --> 39:13.601
-Move!
-No...

39:13.684 --> 39:15.436
No!

39:15.978 --> 39:17.229
On your knees!

39:21.400 --> 39:24.195
I tried, man. I tried.

39:28.574 --> 39:31.702
It's okay. You're free.

39:34.538 --> 39:35.581
You're free to go.

39:49.512 --> 39:51.389
I know you.

39:55.434 --> 39:57.603
I never forget a smell.

39:58.813 --> 40:01.065
Stop. What are you doing?

40:11.158 --> 40:13.619
-Now you see it!
-Stay back!

40:14.912 --> 40:16.163
You stay back!

40:16.247 --> 40:18.707
Or, goddammit, I will teach you a--

40:22.962 --> 40:24.130
See to the General.

41:30.404 --> 41:32.656
Colonel, you have to stop that thing!

41:32.740 --> 41:35.075
If it gets past that tree,
we're all fucked!

41:36.327 --> 41:38.120
Listen to me! Please!

41:38.204 --> 41:40.748
This man is a traitor. Ignore him, airmen.

42:11.737 --> 42:13.113
Drop it!

42:32.508 --> 42:34.593
Don't be scared! Keep going!

42:35.344 --> 42:37.179
Hey! You!

42:37.263 --> 42:39.557
Having a little bit of trouble, are we?

42:39.640 --> 42:42.726
Keep tugging that thing
and it just might pop!

42:42.810 --> 42:44.979
So long, losers!

43:12.548 --> 43:13.549
Fuck!

43:21.098 --> 43:22.099
Oh, fuck!

43:22.600 --> 43:24.018
Lee!

43:44.121 --> 43:46.290
Uh-oh!

43:54.256 --> 43:55.507
Leroy!

44:11.982 --> 44:14.985
Come on, Ronnie! Ronnie, you can do this!

45:25.055 --> 45:26.181
What do you see?

45:27.766 --> 45:29.309
A motherfucking miracle.

46:19.735 --> 46:20.736
Will!

46:20.819 --> 46:22.404
Keep going! It's working!

46:25.324 --> 46:26.909
Ronnie! Ron--

46:26.992 --> 46:29.244
Oh! Oh, shit!

46:41.965 --> 46:44.635
No!

47:58.959 --> 48:00.502
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

48:21.690 --> 48:23.108
Lively crowd.

48:49.134 --> 48:51.595
I thought I was-- Will! Where's Will?

48:51.678 --> 48:54.806
-He's okay.
-He's okay. Oh, shit.

48:54.890 --> 48:56.558
Shit. He's okay.

48:58.101 --> 48:59.227
It's gone.

49:02.522 --> 49:03.690
At the end there...

49:04.942 --> 49:09.947
was that just me,
or did you fe-- feel something?

49:11.740 --> 49:13.825
Like another pair of hands.

49:16.453 --> 49:17.454
Rich.

49:20.666 --> 49:22.209
I felt him too.

49:22.292 --> 49:24.127
I felt him too.

49:27.089 --> 49:28.173
We did it.

49:29.257 --> 49:31.635
Ronnie! Baby!

49:32.427 --> 49:33.679
-Ronnie!
-Daddy!

49:33.762 --> 49:35.180
-Will!
-Mom!

49:35.847 --> 49:36.848
Will!

49:37.724 --> 49:38.809
Come here, baby.

50:27.816 --> 50:28.942
Hi, everybody.

50:30.902 --> 50:34.239
I only knew Rich for about a month.

50:35.782 --> 50:36.992
I know what you're thinking.

50:38.201 --> 50:40.537
How well can you know
anyone in a month?

50:42.080 --> 50:43.540
If you weren't good friends,

50:43.623 --> 50:45.917
why are you even speaking at his funeral?

50:47.169 --> 50:48.587
But maybe

50:48.628 --> 50:53.800
there aren't such things as...
good friends or bad friends.

50:55.135 --> 50:58.221
Maybe there are just friends.

50:59.514 --> 51:03.643
People who stand by us when we're hurt,

51:04.853 --> 51:07.814
and who help us not feel so lonely.

51:09.232 --> 51:14.029
Maybe friends like those
are always worth being scared for...

51:15.280 --> 51:18.408
and hoping for, and living for.

51:20.494 --> 51:24.998
Maybe worth dying for, too...

51:27.167 --> 51:28.627
if that's what has to be.

51:31.546 --> 51:33.215
Rich taught me that too.

51:34.883 --> 51:36.093
No good friends,

51:36.635 --> 51:38.178
no bad friends.

51:39.596 --> 51:40.889
Only people

51:41.681 --> 51:43.141
we want to be with...

51:45.435 --> 51:46.937
need to be with.

51:53.610 --> 51:57.030
People who build their houses
in your heart.

52:13.713 --> 52:15.382
Thank you for those kind words.

52:16.925 --> 52:18.260
And thank you, everyone, for coming

52:18.343 --> 52:21.054
to honor the memory of Ricardo Santos.

52:22.180 --> 52:23.765
God bless you. Go in peace.

53:04.431 --> 53:06.558
The hand you feel on your shoulders...

53:10.145 --> 53:11.313
Your boy's there.

53:14.566 --> 53:15.609
He always will be.

53:27.329 --> 53:28.455
Who are you, sir?

53:31.917 --> 53:33.501
I'm still working on that.

54:06.326 --> 54:07.410
Hey, Dad.

54:10.288 --> 54:12.415
Sorry, I haven't been around much.

54:14.668 --> 54:16.878
I just didn't know what to say.

54:20.423 --> 54:21.424
I'm better now.

54:23.218 --> 54:24.970
So much has happened.

54:26.471 --> 54:28.098
But the good news is...

54:30.600 --> 54:32.185
I made some new friends.

54:49.202 --> 54:51.121
It looks so peaceful from up here.

54:52.122 --> 54:55.875
Almost like... nothing ever happened.

54:58.169 --> 54:59.212
Yeah.

55:02.841 --> 55:03.842
Lil...

55:06.636 --> 55:08.013
it talked to me...

55:09.764 --> 55:10.765
the clown,

55:11.599 --> 55:13.393
when we were alone in the fog.

55:14.561 --> 55:15.729
What do you mean?

55:18.982 --> 55:21.568
He said I'm gonna have a son.

55:23.028 --> 55:24.571
And that he and his friends...

55:26.114 --> 55:28.491
that they kill him in the future.

55:30.535 --> 55:31.745
What?

55:32.329 --> 55:34.497
That's why he wanted to kill me.

55:35.623 --> 55:37.417
He said, to him,

55:37.500 --> 55:40.462
the past, present,
and future are all the same.

55:41.129 --> 55:44.174
And that his death was actually his birth.

55:44.841 --> 55:47.093
He was probably just saying
all that to scare you.

55:47.594 --> 55:48.720
But what if he wasn't?

55:50.972 --> 55:53.141
What if he does see time differently?

55:55.101 --> 55:56.895
What if he can go backwards?

55:58.980 --> 56:00.857
You mean to the past?

56:02.025 --> 56:05.320
I know it sounds crazy,
but what if he tries to go back

56:05.403 --> 56:07.739
and kill someone from the time
before we were born,

56:08.448 --> 56:09.657
like our parents?

56:12.285 --> 56:13.286
I guess...

56:16.539 --> 56:18.333
it'll be someone else's fight.

56:21.419 --> 56:22.629
I guess.

56:32.931 --> 56:37.018
Will! I'm looking at the time.
You said five minutes!

56:37.102 --> 56:38.395
I'm coming, Mom.

56:42.524 --> 56:43.525
Thank you, baby.

56:58.706 --> 56:59.749
Major.

57:03.878 --> 57:06.172
Just stopping by to say au revoir.

57:07.424 --> 57:08.591
How you holdin' up?

57:09.092 --> 57:11.344
Everything hurts.

57:11.428 --> 57:12.846
But whatever that root was...

57:12.929 --> 57:14.347
Whew, boy! Sh--

57:14.889 --> 57:17.183
It quieted those voices down real good.

57:17.976 --> 57:19.144
Hopefully forever.

57:21.271 --> 57:22.856
-You leaving tonight?
-Yeah.

57:23.606 --> 57:26.943
Bus to Boston, plane to London in the a.m.

57:27.026 --> 57:29.863
Got an old buddy back there
who owns a hotel,

57:29.946 --> 57:31.990
wants to give me a shot
cooking in a restaurant.

57:32.073 --> 57:33.575
Okay, fancy stuff.

57:34.742 --> 57:37.287
Well, listen, if you run
into any trouble out there,

57:37.996 --> 57:39.122
you know who you can call.

57:40.206 --> 57:41.708
I owe you.

57:41.791 --> 57:43.376
I think I'll manage.

57:44.169 --> 57:46.212
I mean, how much trouble can a hotel be?

58:06.941 --> 58:08.526
You keep in touch, all right?

58:09.360 --> 58:11.237
I need updates on Will and Char.

58:12.739 --> 58:13.740
I thought you didn't care.

58:16.701 --> 58:17.911
Well, don't tell nobody.

58:24.751 --> 58:28.046
You might wanna put Miss Natalie Wood
in the back seat with Miss Grogan.

58:28.129 --> 58:29.714
It's a long drive now.

58:30.507 --> 58:31.716
I mean, that's right.

58:32.509 --> 58:35.887
-Is that the last one? All right.
-All right.

58:36.846 --> 58:39.849
Now, you know when you get
to crossing St. Stephen who to look for.

58:40.642 --> 58:42.602
Rosa's friends will make it easy.

58:44.020 --> 58:45.063
Thank you.

58:47.524 --> 58:48.525
For everything.

58:49.150 --> 58:51.277
Of course. Of course.

58:54.447 --> 58:55.490
Here you go.

58:55.573 --> 58:57.116
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

58:58.368 --> 59:00.495
So honorable discharge, huh?

59:02.121 --> 59:04.249
I keep my mouth shut,
and they let me walk away.

59:05.083 --> 59:06.292
Yeah.

59:06.376 --> 59:08.378
You know, the military
has always been my life,

59:08.461 --> 59:10.630
but what happened to me and my family,

59:12.173 --> 59:13.299
I don't have faith in it.

59:14.968 --> 59:17.470
Kind of makes you the perfect person
to keep an eye on 'em.

59:19.973 --> 59:22.392
-What do you mean?
-You and Charlotte.

59:26.771 --> 59:29.482
I would like for both of you to join us.

59:31.317 --> 59:33.820
Make sure that your old friends,
or anybody else for that matter,

59:33.903 --> 59:36.072
never tries to reopen that cage.

59:38.533 --> 59:40.118
Others will come.

59:41.786 --> 59:43.746
This isn't the end of the story.

59:46.040 --> 59:49.502
And I've decided
to sell the farm, the house.

59:49.586 --> 59:50.628
It's just...

59:52.338 --> 59:54.507
just too much without Taniel, you know?

59:56.217 --> 59:58.136
I know it's a lot to ask,

59:58.928 --> 01:00:02.265
but you two could really
do some good around here.

01:00:03.182 --> 01:00:06.561
Besides, it'll be 27 years
before that thing wakes up again.

01:00:10.356 --> 01:00:14.277
Listen, Rose, we're honored, but...

01:00:15.194 --> 01:00:18.072
I think me and my family,
we've had enough of Derry.

01:00:20.116 --> 01:00:21.117
Right?

01:00:21.909 --> 01:00:22.910
Right.

01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:26.205
I understand. Really.

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:34.339
I could have sworn
that you threw that stink bomb

01:00:34.422 --> 01:00:36.174
'cause it smelled so bad.

01:00:36.257 --> 01:00:38.509
I told you, it was the stardust.

01:00:45.183 --> 01:00:46.851
You know what they say about Derry.

01:00:48.936 --> 01:00:50.188
Once you leave, you forget.

01:00:52.857 --> 01:00:53.941
That's good, right?

01:00:56.152 --> 01:00:57.987
Is that what you want?

01:01:00.073 --> 01:01:01.532
To forget?

01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:03.701
No.

01:01:04.619 --> 01:01:06.996
There's some parts of this year
I wouldn't mind forgetting.

01:01:08.206 --> 01:01:09.874
Not the you part, of course.

01:01:12.126 --> 01:01:15.380
You know, I guess if that's how it works,
that's how it works.

01:01:16.756 --> 01:01:20.301
So maybe in some way, it's something--

01:01:43.991 --> 01:01:45.159
I'm gonna remember that.

01:01:48.705 --> 01:01:49.789
Kids.

01:01:56.421 --> 01:01:57.422
All right.

01:01:59.257 --> 01:02:00.383
Let's go.

01:02:05.179 --> 01:02:07.014
Char. What's wrong?

01:02:11.269 --> 01:02:12.478
I'm just--

01:02:12.562 --> 01:02:14.605
I'm thinking about Rose's offer.

01:02:16.983 --> 01:02:18.151
You serious?

01:02:21.028 --> 01:02:24.157
I mean, this is how we got
into this mess in the first place.

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:26.784
I mean, you going off on your crusades
and me on mine.

01:02:27.326 --> 01:02:29.871
I thought we were done with that.
No more damn fool missions.

01:02:29.954 --> 01:02:30.997
Yeah.

01:02:32.373 --> 01:02:35.877
But maybe the next damn fool mission
needs to be together.

01:02:46.554 --> 01:02:47.555
Will.

01:02:48.723 --> 01:02:50.600
How would you feel if we stuck around?

01:02:53.811 --> 01:02:54.896
I need a pen.

01:02:59.525 --> 01:03:00.693
More importantly...

01:03:01.986 --> 01:03:03.237
you gonna help me with those sheep?

01:03:03.321 --> 01:03:05.031
Oh, I don't fool with no sheep.

01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:08.075
I don't need to touch no sheep.
You grew up on a farm.

01:03:08.159 --> 01:03:09.368
You know what to do.

01:03:09.911 --> 01:03:12.079
-We might be settling.
-Leave me alone, Mr. Hanlon.

01:03:16.751 --> 01:03:17.835
Dear Ronnie...

01:03:18.503 --> 01:03:20.087
we leave, we forget, right?

01:03:21.088 --> 01:03:24.634
Well, turns out I'm staying.
So maybe I don't have to.

01:03:25.885 --> 01:03:28.095
And maybe if I write to you enough,

01:03:28.930 --> 01:03:30.223
you won't have to either.

01:04:14.016 --> 01:04:16.185
Help me! Help me, please!

01:04:16.269 --> 01:04:18.688
Help me! Where am I?

01:04:18.771 --> 01:04:20.273
The-- The wolves!

01:04:20.356 --> 01:04:21.691
Where am I? The wolves.

01:04:21.774 --> 01:04:24.193
They're looking at me.
They're staring at me.

01:04:24.277 --> 01:04:26.279
Don't let them--
Don't let them look at me, please!

01:04:26.362 --> 01:04:27.488
-Mrs. Kersh, please.
-Please!

01:04:27.572 --> 01:04:29.031
Do not ignore me!

01:04:29.115 --> 01:04:30.324
Listen to me!

01:04:30.408 --> 01:04:32.660
They killed my father.
I know they killed my father.

01:04:32.743 --> 01:04:34.996
I saw the handkerchief. Please!

01:04:35.621 --> 01:04:36.622
Please.

01:04:40.376 --> 01:04:41.377
My father...

01:04:42.545 --> 01:04:43.921
liked to sing.

01:04:49.719 --> 01:04:51.053
Thank you, sir.

01:05:47.777 --> 01:05:51.906
Help her! Someone help her!

01:05:59.914 --> 01:06:00.915
No!

01:06:08.965 --> 01:06:10.466
Yeah. Name?

01:06:10.549 --> 01:06:13.052
Elfrida Marsh.
This time she's really dead.

01:06:39.745 --> 01:06:41.288
Oh, dear.

01:06:42.373 --> 01:06:43.916
Don't be sad.

01:06:45.376 --> 01:06:48.087
You know what they say about Derry.

01:06:49.213 --> 01:06:53.634
No one who dies here ever really dies.
