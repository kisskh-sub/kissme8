[Speed and Love]

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.740
[Episode 10]

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.840
Hello, I'm Pan Kai.

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.400
Everyone calls me Kai.

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:12.930
Nice to meet you.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.620
Let's exchange contact info.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.840
Can I have your phone number?

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.960
I just remembered.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:25.840
There are many great places to eat at

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:26.770
near our school.

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.050
I'll treat you to a meal sometime.

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.120
Let's go together after class—

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.240
Class is starting.

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:32.440
Let's eat together after school.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.280
Be quiet!

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.050
Class has begun.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.360
Province.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.450
Province.

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:39.470
City.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.560
City.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.540
Class dismissed.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.610
Let's go get something delicious.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.750
Let's go.

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:55.930
Let's go.

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.900
Excuse me.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.329
Do we know each other?

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:02.730
We can get to know each other.

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.800
Hey! Hey!

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:06.290
Hey.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:09.560
Hey!

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.450
Who is this Pan Kai?

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.890
Pan Kai? He's Thai-Chinese.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.090
He takes the college entrance exam
every year and fails every time.

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.410
I heard he wants to
go to the Agricultural University,

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.070
but he never managed to get in.

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:27.340
He's also a rich kid.

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.770
His family owns a car repair factory.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.890
Why is he following me around
like a puppy?

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.090
I can't shake him off.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.840
Now he's even following me
to the toilet entrance.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.600
All right, enough joking around.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.860
I'm going to slip away.

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:20.950
Did you bring everything?

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.880
My bro said

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:44.530
working for you

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:45.760
is my honor.

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:51.409
Take this.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:54.480
Okay.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.150
Jiang Mu!

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.580
How could you still find me?

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:02.090
How did you disappear

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:03.050
while you were in the bathroom?

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.980
I've been looking all over for you.

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.580
None of your business.

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:07.610
Don't you take bus 8 home?

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:08.230
Let's go together.

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:09.620
Don't you have a driver?

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:13.910
I have a few questions to ask you.

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.120
Let's talk on the way.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.920
-Let's go.
-You, a senior, are asking me, a newbie?

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:20.700
You look smart.

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:22.730
-Let's go.
-I got to go.

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:23.650
I'm busy. Don't bother me.

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:24.780
Where are you going?

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.060
That's it for now.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.290
I'll treat you to a meal another day.

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:30.490
When did you get back?

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.130
Are you here to pick me up?

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.780
Touqi—

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.090
Sorry,

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.690
I forgot you're not Touqi anymore.

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:39.680
Brandy,

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:40.860
I'm leaving now.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.960
Get in. I'll take you home.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:16.360
What did that guy with bleached hair

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.240
give to Jin Zhao?

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:20.720
It can't be drugs, right?

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.120
What did that person just now

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.320
give you?

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.090
Why did he call you Touqi?

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:46.930
You've been gone so often these days.

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.360
What have you been doing?

00:06:52.159 --> 00:06:53.290
Are you done asking?

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:00.500
Who's that person?

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:03.760
Who?

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.850
The person who stood behind you

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:07.180
wearing white clothes.

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:10.670
A classmate from the foundation course.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:21.610
Be careful.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.380
You're quite patient.

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:00.110
Haven't seen you for days.

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.080
I was just passing by.

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:03.860
Just passing by?

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:08.160
I came to see Lightning.

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:09.760
You're here to see the dog

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.000
but not me?

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:14.020
Well, I'm seeing you now, aren't I?

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:20.910
How's business at the garage these days?

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:23.970
Not bad.

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:25.290
Anyway, Brandy has resumed

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:26.820
his normal business hours.

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:28.730
But people here
tend to wake up late,

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:29.970
so we open around 2 PM.

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:35.799
Is he still in bed?

00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:37.370
No way.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.659
That freak barely sleeps.

00:08:39.679 --> 00:08:41.880
He gets up at six or seven every morning.

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:43.600
That early?

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:45.020
Where did he go then?

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:49.290
You have so many questions—

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:52.050
why don't you just ask him yourself?

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.480
If I go ask him,

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:55.530
I'm afraid he'll kick me out.

00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:57.290
Why would he kick you out for no reason?

00:08:57.290 --> 00:08:59.770
Because he doesn't like me.
He thinks I'm annoying.

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:01.480
Our Jiang Mu is so adorable.

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:05.030
Only a blind person wouldn't like you.

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:06.890
I think so too.

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:08.240
That'd be Brandy.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.010
What if he really kicks you out?

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:15.890
What can I do?

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:18.050
I'll sing for him, tell jokes,

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.320
perform magic tricks,

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.530
and if all else fails,

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:21.620
I'll dance for him.

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:23.600
You can dance?

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:24.840
Just a little.

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:26.870
I learned ballet when I was young.

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:27.750
Think about it.

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.560
If I actually dance for him,

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:32.160
would he still have the heart
to kick me out?

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:36.170
Did you hear that?

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:39.540
Come down quickly to see your little swan.

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:45.470
Go ahead and dance.

00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:55.630
Little swan, why are you leaving?

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:57.290
Not dancing anymore?

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:06.990
[Speeding Auto House]

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:51.530
Do you think

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:53.790
no one in this world
can keep you in check?

00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:00.770
Happy birthday,

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:02.530
Zhao.

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:12.410
The first wish

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.440
needs to be said aloud to come true.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.770
I wish we

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.800
will soon find out your real birthday.

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:27.880
Hello everyone.

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:29.760
I'm Jiang Mu, Jin Zhao's sister.

00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:31.650
I've decided

00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:33.570
not to call you brother anymore.

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:36.360
I'll just call you
by your full name, Jin Zhao.

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:39.510
I plan to stay

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.260
and apply to a school here.

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:44.050
Nana has already helped me contact

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:45.600
a language foundation course.

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:46.840
Do you want me to stay?

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.010
I didn't expect you'd really come.

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.250
Your habits,

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:52.450
preferences,

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.440
and your tone—

00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:56.620
they've long become things I remember

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:58.280
without even having to think.

00:11:58.720 --> 00:11:59.650
I don't know why,

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:01.050
but lately

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:03.360
I can't help thinking about you.

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:05.670
Not because anything special happened,

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.440
I just want to make sure
you're still there.

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:11.040
And some words have been
on the tip of my tongue—

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:12.560
it's not that I don't want to say them,

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:13.440
it's just that

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:16.130
I haven't figured out
how to tell you them.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:23.290
Hey, handsome.

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:25.020
Why are you here so early today?

00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:26.720
I'll call you if I want anything to eat.

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:27.290
I'm leaving.

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:27.770
Okay.

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:41.680
You're quite fast today.

00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:43.720
Half an hour round trip.

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:47.320
I know the roads and turns well now—

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:48.920
familiar with the route now.

00:12:58.400 --> 00:12:59.090
Take this.

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:02.730
You removed the ABS?

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:03.990
From today on,

00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:06.880
you need to learn to control
the car completely with your feet.

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:09.210
You can't rely on any braking assistance.

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:10.370
If you want to go faster,

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:11.970
you have to rely on yourself.

00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:13.170
But remember,

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:15.840
you must remain steady.

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:18.490
A scratch is a minor issue,

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.080
but a rollover could be fatal.

00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:25.690
So do we need to change the tires too?

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:28.010
No, just use these.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:31.200
It takes a good driver to drive well,
not tires.

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:42.070
Remember, stay steady.

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:55.340
You've been secretly drawing me,

00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:57.420
yet acting like nothing happened.

00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:02.110
If I were to ask you about it,

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:03.910
you probably wouldn't admit it.

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:09.650
Just wait.

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:12.090
I'll give you a surprise too.

00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:54.770
How was your practice today?

00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:58.440
This car feels weird today.

00:15:58.650 --> 00:16:00.170
Sometimes it feels front-heavy.

00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:01.520
And sometimes the rear slides too much.

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:02.920
It's got me all confused.

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:07.410
Why don't you try my car?

00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:14.810
Yes, that one.

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:03.700
What are you doing?

00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:04.650
Go on.

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:06.760
Give me 10 minutes.

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:09.030
Three minutes is enough for you.

00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:19.849
What did you want to see me about?

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:22.240
I heard

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:24.720
you came in first place
in the last race.

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.530
Just tell me what you want.

00:17:27.329 --> 00:17:28.790
I've got my eye on someone.

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:32.240
Who's the lucky one?

00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:34.180
The one who came in last.

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:35.110
Who?

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:36.890
In the last race.

00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:38.760
Brandy?

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:41.720
I think his name was...

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:43.720
Jin Zhao.

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:46.270
Yes, that's him.

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:47.300
Let me tell you.

00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:48.620
That guy's got skills.

00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:50.440
Control, power,

00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:51.960
and amazing adaptability too—

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:53.890
he practically has no weaknesses.

00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:56.910
Then how did he lose to you?

00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:05.680
Wan Dayong played dirty tricks
on him last time.

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:07.370
If he weren't mentally strong

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:08.650
and has quick reflexes,

00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:10.280
driving backward to the finish line,

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:11.570
he would've been eliminated.

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:12.410
Honestly,

00:18:12.850 --> 00:18:14.510
among the top 10 drivers in the alliance,

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:16.650
he's the only one
whose style I can't figure out.

00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:17.890
In the next race,
if nothing goes wrong

00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:19.120
with his mods...

00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:20.850
it's hard to say who'll win.

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:21.930
At best it's 50-50.

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.140
What kind of mods does he need?

00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:27.520
Reinforced seals

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:29.380
and reinforced center shaft.

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:33.100
These two need to be imported.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:34.650
Someone's trying to sabotage him

00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:36.370
so he can't rise in ranks
by accumulating points,

00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:38.900
so they bought up all the stock
in the country.

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:47.080
Send me the product numbers.

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:48.690
What are you going to do?

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:50.960
Give him a push.

00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:58.040
I...

00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:00.620
Won't send them.

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:08.000
Fine, fine.

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:09.470
I'll send them.

00:19:09.910 --> 00:19:11.910
I'll send them to you. Just a moment.

00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:16.550
Sent.

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:19.220
Friendly reminder,

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:21.140
I think that guy is a bit strange.

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:22.000
During the Scramble,

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.460
he brought his girlfriend
as his navigator.

00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:26.380
They work together perfectly.

00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:28.130
She's called...

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.090
Something Mu...

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:33.040
The girl you carried away

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:34.170
when she suddenly fainted in front of me

00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:35.500
at your birthday party.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:38.960
Jiang Mu.

00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:42.650
Why don't

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:44.330
we go see her?

00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:46.850
See Jiang Mu?

00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:48.680
When?

00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:50.130
Now.

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:52.280
Well...

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:55.210
Can I take a shower first?

00:19:59.040 --> 00:19:59.680
How is it?

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:01.040
My car drives well, right?

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:02.520
Your car is automatic.

00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:04.720
That doesn't hinder drifting.

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:06.720
The shifting efficiency and explosive power
of an auto car

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:07.850
are far from enough.

00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:09.330
I need a manual car.

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:11.810
Your requirements are quite advanced...

00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:14.790
But there aren't any manual cars
available now.

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:20.790
Cousin?

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:31.410
My cousin is the best driver
I've ever seen.

00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:32.520
I'm sure he can find something

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:34.050
to meet your requirements.

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:40.760
Would he be willing to teach me?

00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:42.560
Follow my lead and play it by ear.

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:47.200
Brandy's little navigator—

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:48.130
we meet again.

00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:50.950
My handsome and kind-hearted cousin,

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.680
could you teach my little Jiang Mu

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:54.610
a master class on drift cornering?

00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:55.680
Please.

00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:02.740
You want to learn drifting from me?

00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:08.480
Why?

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:09.650
Don't you have

00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:11.370
better men around you?

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:19.420
I've been in your car twice

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:20.350
and I think

00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:22.280
you're the best drifter I know.

00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:25.650
Alright,

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:28.180
just for that compliment,

00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:29.490
I'll teach you.

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:34.250
But there's one condition.

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:35.650
You have to keep it a secret

00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:37.050
and not tell anyone else.

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:38.850
Who don't you want

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:40.430
me to not tell?

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:44.540
Just the few of us here should know,

00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:46.180
don't tell anyone else.

00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:49.040
Okay,

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:50.670
sure.

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:54.960
Give me the keys.

00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:00.600
The car I'm driving today won't work.

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:03.000
It's too heavy, not suitable for drifting.

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:05.740
Let's use this one.

00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:08.720
Get in.

00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:11.270
What are you doing?

00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:13.110
That's Brandy's girlfriend.

00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:15.130
Are you trying to have an affair?

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:16.770
Using my car on top of that?

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:20.460
Remember to record it.

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:33.850
It's the third time

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:36.400
you're sitting in my passenger seat,

00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:38.670
Brandy's little navigator.

00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:39.930
What about you?

00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:41.610
Do you have a navigator?

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:42.930
No.

00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:45.190
I can't trust anyone.

00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:50.570
What do you want to learn?

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:52.570
I've watched many drift races,

00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:54.160
especially exhibition matches

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:55.610
where drivers have complete control

00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:56.810
over their cars.

00:22:57.550 --> 00:22:58.410
They can draw various shapes

00:22:58.410 --> 00:22:59.850
with their tire marks.

00:23:00.570 --> 00:23:02.170
I just can't control it well.

00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:05.650
What shape do you want?

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:12.440
The number three.

00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:14.730
It's a horizontal three—

00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:15.950
two semi-circles.

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:20.150
Drifting isn't difficult, but

00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:21.360
I'm curious

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:23.760
what these two semi-circles represent.

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:26.780
You're gesturing it correctly.

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:28.020
Just add

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:29.030
two little tails at the end

00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:31.630
and it would be better
if they can be connected.

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:35.300
Do you understand?

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:37.620
That's truly a perfect shape.

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:41.290
Alright,

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:43.170
I'll teach you this.

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:56.160
What's this for?

00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:57.560
Wrap it where?

00:23:58.470 --> 00:23:59.800
No food delivery today.

00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:03.580
Go tie your right hand
to the steering wheel.

00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:07.180
Control your steering angle.

00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:09.590
The smaller the angle,
the faster you return the wheel,

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:11.250
and the faster you take turns.

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:13.800
Let your brain develop muscle memory.

00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:18.820
How long do I keep it tied?

00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:23.890
Until you can handle it effortlessly.

00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:43.810

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:52.680
Look at the tire marks on the ground.

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:53.610
Circles and the figure 8—

00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:55.140
you've just learned those.

00:25:55.530 --> 00:25:56.800
To change the shape,

00:25:57.090 --> 00:25:59.600
you need both route design and technique.

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:02.000
You need speed to drift.

00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:04.150
So before every drift,

00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:06.030
you must drive in a straight line.

00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:21.410
The first semicircle.

00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:31.420
The little tail you wanted.

00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:34.830
That's interesting.

00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:52.110
The second semicircle.

00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:54.430
Do you understand?

00:26:56.650 --> 00:26:57.280
I got it.

00:26:57.610 --> 00:26:58.740
The path is perfect.

00:27:01.810 --> 00:27:03.840
That's exactly the pattern I wanted.

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:04.630
Let me try.

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:21.760
Place your hand here.

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:26.960
Relax this part a bit.

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:29.740
Relax your shoulders too.

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:32.040
Grip it here.

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:34.790
What are you guys

00:27:34.810 --> 00:27:36.130
really up to?

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.480
It's a secret.

00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:41.130
Look at you being all tight-lipped now.

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:42.630
You can go ask Lin Sui.

00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:50.810
Okay.

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:52.370
Relax your

00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:54.090
shoulders.

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:55.870
Alright.

00:28:09.370 --> 00:28:11.500
Why don't you pause when shifting gears?

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:14.090
One, you're not releasing the clutch
decisively enough.

00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:16.350
Your acceleration isn't smooth enough.

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:20.800
I forgot how to say it in Chinese...

00:28:22.170 --> 00:28:22.890
May I?

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:33.740
Just like this.

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:34.570
Push it down

00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:35.650
in an instant.

00:29:28.410 --> 00:29:29.370
Did you see that?

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:30.440
I did it!

00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:32.520
You surprised me.

00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:35.440
I like Chinese girls.

00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:41.980
I also like handsome boys too.

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:46.760
Practice well.

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:50.480
I hope your dreams come true.

00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:52.100
Thank you.

00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:59.220
You're amazing, Mu.

00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:05.620
Thanks for your car.

00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:08.020
Quite impressive, young girl.

00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:11.680
You've got both the car
and the people wrapped around your finger.

00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:15.230
We'll be going now.

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:17.200
Thank you.

00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:25.270
My cousin seems

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:27.290
to be interested in you.

00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:30.530
He's just pretending to pursue me.

00:30:30.530 --> 00:30:31.290
What?

00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:42.260
Hand on gear, feet on gas and clutch,

00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:44.010
your movements have to be fast.

00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:45.370
For sharp turns,

00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:47.280
turn the wheel and pull the handbrake—

00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:48.040
spin back.

00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:55.280
Straight-line acceleration
depends on the mods.

00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:57.040
Just be quick with your hands and feet.

00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:59.770
Taking corners fast
is what makes you truly fast.

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:10.200
When taking corners, go with the momentum.

00:31:11.130 --> 00:31:12.200
Your rear end loses control

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:14.240
because you're too slow at every step,

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:15.570
especially braking.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.240
If you brake too slowly,
inertia will control you.

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:19.970
Don't let inertia control you.

00:31:20.110 --> 00:31:21.840
You need to make use of inertia.

00:31:30.890 --> 00:31:32.280
It's just like stir-frying.

00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:33.740
Whether a dish tastes good

00:31:34.170 --> 00:31:35.820
depends on heat, seasoning,

00:31:36.130 --> 00:31:37.200
and ingredients.

00:31:39.050 --> 00:31:39.960
As for grip,

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:42.740
it's divided between acceleration,

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:43.810
braking,

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:47.570
and steering—three ways to split the pie.

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:52.440
When driving straight,

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:54.810
100% of grip is
used for deceleration.

00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:56.330
When cornering,

00:31:56.890 --> 00:31:58.620
steering takes away some grip.

00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:02.050
If the heat is too high,
the food will burn.

00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:04.370
Release the gas, stop accelerating.

00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:06.200
Only when you simmer in low heat

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:07.520
can flavors develop.

00:32:14.810 --> 00:32:17.410
The front wheels
gain more load due to inertia.

00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:19.330
Delay your braking point,

00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:21.720
and the whole grip pie gets bigger.

00:32:43.330 --> 00:32:45.350
Step on the gas pedal
immediately after the turn

00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:46.700
to exit the turn faster.

00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:54.240
What if the car body is unstable

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:56.570
when going through consecutive S-turns?

00:32:57.330 --> 00:32:58.240
With beef,

00:32:58.530 --> 00:33:01.000
you can't stir-fry too long
or it gets tough.

00:33:01.410 --> 00:33:02.170
Similarly,

00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:05.240
gentle S-curves are high-speed turns—

00:33:05.310 --> 00:33:06.590
you need to be fast.

00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:09.090
So,

00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:11.420
brake as late as possible,

00:33:12.670 --> 00:33:13.800
or don't brake at all

00:33:14.210 --> 00:33:15.300
to maintain speed.

00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:16.730
That's right.

00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:21.170
Quick stir-fry needs high heat.

00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:24.930
High heat quickly seals in the moisture

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:26.160
keeping food tender.

00:33:28.050 --> 00:33:29.160
For S-curves,

00:33:31.850 --> 00:33:33.250
stick to the inside line.

00:33:33.850 --> 00:33:35.660
Treat the S-curve as

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:37.960
one straight line for the fastest path.

00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:49.650
Try it.

00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:51.159
Why does this car feel
so easy to drive today?

00:34:51.159 --> 00:34:52.000
Obviously,

00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:54.370
you were running with sandbags before.

00:34:54.370 --> 00:34:56.639
Without them, of course you'll fly.

00:34:58.140 --> 00:34:58.820
Thanks.

00:34:59.290 --> 00:35:00.290
Don't mention it.

00:35:00.930 --> 00:35:02.140
There are 20 deliveries later.

00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:04.430
Once you're done showing off,
get back to work.

00:35:04.430 --> 00:35:05.940
I'll finish within 30 minutes.

00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:08.060
30 minutes is your limit?

00:35:11.410 --> 00:35:12.330
15 minutes.

00:35:12.850 --> 00:35:13.960
That's ambitious.

00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:15.850
That's worthy of my car

00:35:16.010 --> 00:35:17.270
and my cooking skills.

00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:26.130
Don't drink too much.

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:29.170
Do you remember?

00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:31.480
The customer who speaks Chinese

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:33.610
at the restaurant,
the rich young man.

00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:36.790
He definitely
didn't just come for the food.

00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:37.940
-It seems—
-I know.

00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:40.120
You know?

00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:42.120
You don't even use your brain!

00:35:42.250 --> 00:35:43.310
You think you know?

00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:44.000
Let me tell you.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.600
Isn't he just that guy who puked
after eating too many dumplings?

00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:51.330
How did you know?

00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:54.480
The car he drives

00:35:54.850 --> 00:35:56.330
and that vibe he gives off—

00:35:56.890 --> 00:35:58.440
he's here for Jin Zhao.

00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:04.240
So what vibe did you pick up?

00:36:04.730 --> 00:36:06.600
The smell of male rivalry.

00:36:09.730 --> 00:36:11.250
Should we talk to Zhao about it?

00:36:11.250 --> 00:36:12.210
No need.

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:15.890
But...

00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:16.740
Enough.

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:18.600
Look at you,

00:36:18.810 --> 00:36:19.960
not acting like a father at all,

00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:21.490
just drinking all the time.

00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:24.020
We really don't need to talk about it?

00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:26.250
I'm not drinking.

00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:46.480
Excuse me,

00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:48.410
could you tell me how to get to EA class?

00:36:48.410 --> 00:36:50.510
I'm sorry,
I can't understand what you're saying.

00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:51.180
Thank you.

00:37:00.970 --> 00:37:03.140
Mr. Chen is so annoying,

00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:05.420
always pushing me to submit my homework.

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:07.210
Then you should get it done faster.

00:37:07.210 --> 00:37:08.610
Oh my god, Jiang Mu, look!

00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:10.730
He's so handsome!

00:37:11.370 --> 00:37:12.830
Is he a parent or a student?

00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:16.030
He's my parent.

00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:20.070
Is that your genius brother?

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:21.730
Can I meet him?

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:24.890
Did you hear that?

00:37:24.890 --> 00:37:26.550
Mr. Chen is calling you again.

00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:28.120
Go quickly!

00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:29.730
I heard it.

00:37:57.470 --> 00:37:58.730
Why are you here early?

00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:03.130
I came to see how you're doing in school.

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:06.090
I'm doing excellently, of course.

00:38:10.690 --> 00:38:12.690
My classmate just said

00:38:12.930 --> 00:38:14.860
she thought you were a student too.

00:38:16.890 --> 00:38:18.080
I do look young.

00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:22.950
How shameless.

00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:31.240
Hello everyone.

00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:37.290
Respected parents,

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:39.850
thank you all for coming

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:43.160
to today's open day event.

00:38:43.730 --> 00:38:46.480
Although we are
just a language training school,

00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:48.510
we still pay great attention

00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:50.120
to students' overall development

00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:52.380
and offer various interesting courses.

00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:55.500
We come from different places.

00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:57.160
Mu.

00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:01.640
Mu, please come up and say a few words.

00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:14.250
Hello everyone, I'm Jiang Mu.

00:39:14.690 --> 00:39:17.020
I enjoy my time studying here

00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:19.400
and am glad to meet everyone here.

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:22.330
Although we've only spent a short

00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:24.080
time together,

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:26.800
I really like the learning atmosphere here

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:29.360
and I'm happy to be friends with you all.

00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:31.270
I hope in the days to come

with everyone in the future.

Are you cold?

00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:30.020
Why did it suddenly rain so heavily?

It's just a passing shower.
It'll be gone in no time.

00:40:34.290 --> 00:40:35.250
