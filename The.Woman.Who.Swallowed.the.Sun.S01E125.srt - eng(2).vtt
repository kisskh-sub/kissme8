Let go! Let me go!

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:08.750
Father.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:16.550
You think I'm going to let you
get away with this?

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.260
I'll destroy you with my own two hands.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.460
I'll make sure you end up
just like your father.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.400
Just you watch. I'll tear you to shreds.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.070
- Get him in the car.
- Let go of me!

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.440

(Final Episode)

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.400
Hey. So did father harm
Director Moon’s parents?

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.540
No way. Even Dad wouldn't go that far.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.170
It's true.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.780
Father might spend his whole life
in prison.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:14.950
What?

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.780
How can you say that
without even batting an eye?

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.490
Seriously, what is going on?
We lost the company to that woman,

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.820
and now Father is in jail.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.130
This is insane.
What are you talking about?

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.560
So Lucia was the one who turned Dad in?

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.130
Baek Sul Hee.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.600
What?

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.600
It isn't Lucia, it's Baek Sul Hee.

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.300
And it's not Se Ri, it's Mi So.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.010
Hey, what are you talking about?

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.940
- Hey, what's gotten into you?
- Se Ri is that woman's daughter.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.350
The babies were switched,

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.120
so I've been raising that woman's daughter
this whole time.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.990
Hey, what is that supposed to mean?

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.690
She just said the babies were switched!

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.130
- Then where's your real daughter?
- Hey, wait. Hold on a second.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.000
So you're saying Se Ri
is Lucia's daughter? Is that it?

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.300
Hey, are you sure about this?

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.740
- This better not be a joke.
- I wish it were.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.280
Ji Seop, where are you going?

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.210
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.430
Where's Se Ri? Is she in her room?

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.970
I thought I heard someone come in.

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.380
- It's Mr. Ji Seop.
- Why did he come home at this hour?

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:53.480
Where did Ji Seop go?

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.110
To Se Ri's room.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.280
Unbelievable.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.890
What are you doing here at this hour?
Shouldn't you be at the company?

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.860
Are you the daughter...

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:09.690
of Lucia, or whatever her name is?

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.400
- Ji Seop.
- Answer me!

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.470
Are you?

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.240
I'm asking you one last time.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:19.800
Are you...

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.870
really her daughter?

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.610
Yes, she's my birth mother.

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:28.750
You!

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.020
I don't know why you wormed into our home
pretending to be Kyung Chae's daughter,

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.090
and frankly, I don't care.
But if you're really her daughter,

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.590
go stop your mother.

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.760
Do you have any idea
what your mother just did?

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.000
She turned in our father,
and he was dragged off by the police.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.700
She took over Mingang and became chairman.
That mother of yours!

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:49.230
Listen.

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.400
We're sworn enemies with your mother now,
aren't we?

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.970
So what sense is there in her daughter
still hanging around here?

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.240
Does it make any sense at all?

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.250
- Answer me! Does it make any sense?
- Ji Seop, stop it!

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.220
- Let's get him out of here.
- You were...

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.820
- Mr. Ji Seop, please stop.
- the problem all along

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.790
Min Se Ri! That little brat!
She was the problem!

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.120
Ever since she set foot in this house,
everything's gone wrong!

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.960
Hey, Min Se Ri!
If you have a shred of conscience,

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.630
shouldn't you be on your knees
begging to be allowed to live here?

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:21.400
Hey, Se Ri!

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.390
- Mom.
- Se Ri, what's with your voice?

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:45.890
Can you come to the house right now?

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.930
Ji Seop is furious, and I'm terrified.

(Mingang Distribution)

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.280
- Yes, Manager Gong.
- Ms. Kyung Chae, you must come home now.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.080
Mr. Ji Seop is absolutely livid,
and he's tearing into Se Ri.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.190
I'm afraid he's going to do
something drastic.

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.990
Got it. I'm on my way.

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.000
Hey, Min Se Ri!

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.070
No, wait.

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:29.870
She's not even Min Se Ri.

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:32.000
Hey, whatever! Just get down here!

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.070
What are you doing? I said, get down here!

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.910
Seriously, are you even listening
to what I’m saying?

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.650
Get down here this instant!

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.960
Hey, if you're the daughter
of that Lucia woman,

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.290
then go tell your mother
to get over here right now.

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:59.000
Tell her to give up the chairman position
and drop the charges against my father.

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.600
- Ji Seop, you're still my brother.
- Don't you dare call me that.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.370
What makes you think I'm your brother?

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:08.010
My sister...

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:09.370
I mean, my niece...

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:11.510
had the misfortune
of being switched with you,

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.680
and she croaked a long time ago.

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:15.550
You coming into our family...

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:17.550
was a disaster...

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.420
and a curse.

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:22.690
Go!

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.690
Go get your mother!

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:25.720
I said, go!

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:27.630
You're still not going?

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:39.370
- Ms. Se Ri, get up.
- Se Ri...

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:45.640
What do you think you're doing?

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:50.110
Did you just hit me?

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.650
You just hit me, didn't you?
Fine. Bring it on.

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:06.000
Are you crazy?

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.300
So your own kid is precious, is that it?

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:10.670
Fine. Just you wait.

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:14.010
Get out of my way!

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:21.650
Ji Seop, what are you doing?

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:23.450
Stop it!
Do you want to get into serious trouble?

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:27.550
Listen to her. Put that down right now.
The child hasn't done anything wrong.

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:28.650
Let go!

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:31.420
She may be innocent,

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.490
but her mother is guilty, right?

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:35.090
Guilty as ever.

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:36.660
If you lay one finger on my daughter,

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.330
I swear I'll make you pay.

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:48.410
No!

(Seoul Central District Court)

00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:59.880
The defendant, Min Doo Sik, 30 years ago,

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.950
murdered Han Kyung Soo
and Yoon Hee Jeong...

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.190
in a staged car accident.

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:07.560
He illegally appropriated
the victims' core technology...

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:10.060
and defrauded them
of their corporate assets.

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.500
To cover up the incident,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.430
he coerced Jo Pil Doo
into giving a false confession,

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:18.740
and later had him kidnapped and murdered,
then disposed of the body.

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:21.870
Furthermore, he ordered
the kidnapping and murder...

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:25.080
of the victims' sole surviving relative,
Moon Tae Kyung.

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:26.910
All charges have been proven.

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:29.950
These offenses...

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.020
demonstrate a flagrant disregard
for human life...

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:35.290
and are serious crimes that undermine
the very foundation of our legal system.

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:37.760
The nature of his crimes
is exceptionally heinous,

00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:40.960
and no extenuating circumstances
have been found.

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:43.130
Therefore, this court...

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:45.630
will sentence the defendant, Min Doo Sik,

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.600
as follows.

you are hereby sentenced
to life in prison.

This is a setup! A conspiracy!

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:04.850

Now let me go!

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:20.530

When did they leave?

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:16.150
Darn it. You should've called me sooner!
I've got to go.

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:31.240
Darn...

Hey, it's me. I think I need to flee
the country right now.

Liquidate the nominee shares
as fast as you can.

And deposit all the remaining cash
into the Swiss bank account.

Yes. It looks like
I'm about to go down for this too.

I'm out of time. Do it now.

Is that Moon Tae Kyung?

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:25.520
So you think you can stop me?

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:29.030
All right. Give it your best shot.

Then you'll be charged with managing
Chairman Min Doo Sik's slush fund...

- and handed over to the prosecutors.
- Let me go.

when you had the chance.

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:23.370
You're a lawyer, so you should know
how many years you're getting.

00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:26.740
Good luck getting along
with Chairman Min in there.

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:27.950
Let go of me.

00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:29.480
Let go of me, you jerk!

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:31.650
I said, let go!

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:34.790
Darn it!

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:51.970
(Cell phone use is prohibited.
Your cooperation is appreciated.)

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:05.350
You must feel like
you're on top of the world.

00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:07.250
The company and your new man.

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:10.250
Enjoy it while it lasts.

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:13.320
The day I get out of here
and take back my company,

00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:17.130
you two will be on a train
straight to ruin.

00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:19.100
You haven't changed a bit.

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.330
You're still acting like you're
the king of the world, even in here.

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:23.670
Of course, I am.

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:25.870
You still don't get it.

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:29.270
Guys like me are the ones
who really run the world.

00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:31.340
Because I'm the sun.

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:35.650
Everyone revolved around me,
including you.

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:37.880
That's where you're wrong.

00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:41.020
You weren't a light.

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:43.690
You were a raging inferno of greed.

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:47.760
You thought you were a beacon for people,
but you...

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:49.990
just burned them all.

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:52.900
So now you think you can extinguish me?

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:56.270
The sun can never be extinguished.

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:58.340
It’s not meant to be put out.

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:01.940
It’s meant to be swallowed.

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:06.080
Because in the end, a sun like you...

00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:09.810
was swallowed by me.

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:31.600
Hey.

00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:40.480
- You're here early.
- Yes.

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:45.220
Oh my goodness.
It's been ages since I was last here.

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:49.690
I know. The three of us used to come here
all the time when Mi So was a baby.

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:53.390
I heard they're closing down,
so I was feeling sentimental.

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:55.230
I thought we could reminisce,
just the two of us.

00:15:57.190 --> 00:16:01.230
Mi So used to beg to come here every day.

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.100
And to think I made such a big deal
out of it back then.

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:08.740
I really should have brought her
here more often.

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:17.310
- We have time. I'm going to the restroom.
- Okay.

00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:38.040
(September 28, 2006)

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:40.200
(The day you were born)

00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:25.820
Okay, is this thing on?

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:28.150
There we go.

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:35.490
Why am I nervous now?

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:43.970
Hi, my darling Madam Baek.

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:50.110
I wanted to make this video message
for your birthday,

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:54.610
but I feel so awkward talking to a camera.

00:17:57.710 --> 00:18:01.520
Thank you for bringing me into this world
and for raising me.

00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:05.090
You once said...

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:09.090
that you wouldn't trade me for anything
in the world, remember?

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:14.570
Well, you're my whole world too.

00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:19.400
By the time you're watching this video,

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:21.670
I'll have already given you your present.

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:25.280
So, what do you think of the dress?

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:28.010
You remember it, don't you?

00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:32.950
You couldn't buy it because you were
saving up for me.

00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:37.450
So I decided to splurge
so you could look beautiful in it.

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:40.090
I hope you'll wear it often.

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:41.860
Brag about your daughter
while you're at it.

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:44.830
Listen.

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:49.800
I will graduate, go to a good college,
and make sure you live like a queen.

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:51.140
You can count on it.

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:54.870
I will repay you for raising me.

00:18:58.180 --> 00:18:59.410
Mom...

00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:01.580
I love you.

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:03.680
Happy birthday.

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:07.680
Happy birthday.

00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:51.160
What is all this?

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:54.360
Yeon Ah helped me out.

00:19:56.770 --> 00:20:01.570
She said she found this video by chance
while going through Mi So's laptop.

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:04.010
She was so thoughtful for her age.

00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:08.680
She loved her mother with all her heart.

00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:31.230
Even if the rest of the world
forgets Mi So,

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:34.540
I will never forget her.

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:40.040
The love and warm memories Mi So left us,

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:43.150
our precious daughter, Se Ri,

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:46.880
and every moment I share with you.

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:50.490
I want to cherish it all
for the rest of my life.

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:54.190
Let's put all the pain
and hardship behind us.

00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:57.290
And from now on,
for the rest of our lives,

00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:00.000
let's spend our days smiling together.

00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:05.300
Will you...

00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:08.170
marry...

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:10.040
me?

00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:56.690
Oh, dear.

00:21:57.890 --> 00:21:58.990
Here, open your mouth.

00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:05.860
I'm craving so much fruit for some reason.
I can even skip meals,

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:07.500
but I just have to have fruit, you know?

00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:10.830
They say craving fruit
means you're having a girl.

00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:13.800
Really? I was hoping for a girl.

00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:15.740
A daughter just like our Se Ri.

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:18.840
What is this nonsense you're spouting?

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:21.580
She's not even blood.
What's with this "our Se Ri" business?

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:24.410
She's just someone you got tangled up with
by a strange twist of fate.

00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:28.050
Don't say that, Dad.
She is such a sweetheart.

00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:32.720
She takes care of Kyung Chae by herself
and juggles several part-time jobs.

00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:34.790
She's an absolute gem.

00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:36.960
Come on. Mom, seriously!

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:41.600
Mom, how many times do I have to tell you?

00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:42.800
This right here!

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:44.470
I keep telling you
it's full of harmful chemicals,

00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:46.440
so it's bad for Ja Kyung.

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:51.010
I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking.
Besides, everyone else uses them.

00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:53.640
I don't care if they do!
We are not using them in this house!

00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:57.380
I made you all those natural sponges,
but you still insist on using this.

00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:02.050
You'd make a perfect stay-at-home husband.
It's your true calling.

00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:04.690
Why don't you just have the baby for her
while you're at it?

00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:07.220
If you love this so much,
how did you manage to work in an office?

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:10.330
I think I've discovered a new talent
myself lately.

00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:14.330
With homemaking, the more you do it,
the more you learn the ropes.

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:16.970
It's pretty fun and rewarding.

00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:20.470
- Right. Keep up the good work.
- I will!

00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:22.240
- You could even start a cleaning service.
- You bet!

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:24.510
- Become a true master of housekeeping.
- Yes, sir!

00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:26.740
- Maybe even get a national award for it.
- Okay, I get it.

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:29.010
- If this vase breaks, you'll clean it up!
- No.

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:30.080
For crying out loud!

00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:38.960
Mi So.

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:42.360
My daughter.

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:45.160
How can you be the spitting image of me?

00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:48.600
From head to toe,

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:51.370
you're just like me, my daughter.

00:23:57.610 --> 00:23:59.810
All she's done all day is ask for Mi So.

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:02.680
So she has.

00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:06.820
She's so persistent for a daughter
she doesn't even recognize.

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:11.220
Mom.

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:17.960
Mi So, when did you get here?

00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:19.760
I've been waiting for you.

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:26.200
You've forgotten all about me
and only remember Mi So.

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:31.370
But that's okay
because I remember you, Mom.

00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:35.480
I've been thinking about you all day long.

00:24:36.150 --> 00:24:38.180
I couldn't think of anything else.

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:40.350
I've only been thinking about you too.

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:43.620
I couldn't think of anything else at all.

00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:48.690
I'm so grateful for that someone
as beautiful and kind as you...

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:52.000
is my mother.

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:55.130
I'm so happy.

00:24:57.330 --> 00:24:58.370
You're happy?

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:00.600
Yes.

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:02.240
I'm happy.

00:25:02.910 --> 00:25:05.140
I'm so happy that you're my mom.

00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:12.250
Don't cry. Why are you crying?

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:14.420
You should be smiling if you're happy.

00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:21.320
I want you
to spend your whole life smiling.

00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:23.830
Not crying.

00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:27.060
I'll do all the crying for you,

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:28.630
so you just have to smile.

00:25:29.970 --> 00:25:31.100
You can do that, can't you?

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:34.640
Yes, I will.

00:25:36.610 --> 00:25:38.340
I'll do exactly as you say, Mom.

00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:43.410
Mi So,

00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:45.180
do you want to go on a picnic with me?

00:25:47.050 --> 00:25:48.120
Let's go on a picnic.

00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:49.790
Mom.

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:52.920
You just wait.

00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:58.130
- Let's go.
- The mother is acting like her child!

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.130
Se Ri.

00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:03.030
Just a moment.

00:26:04.030 --> 00:26:05.070
Mom!

00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:09.470
Oh, dear.

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:12.040
Why are you out here?

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:16.280
- Mom was feeling frustrated inside.
- Here, take this.

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:20.680
Your mom looks so happy.

00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:22.950
She really does.

00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:27.220
When she was CEO of Mingang Distribution,
she was always angry and shouting.

00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:30.130
But now she's always smiling.
I wonder what she's so happy about.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.930
I told you, I can hire a caregiver
if it gets to be too much.

00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:37.800
She's my mom.
I should be the one to take care of her.

00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:41.440
- Mom, I'm just going to the restroom.
- Okay.

00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:43.740
Mom!

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:50.480
You're here again.

00:26:54.850 --> 00:26:55.920
Have you been okay?

00:26:59.290 --> 00:27:00.890
What did you bring me today?

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:03.760
The lady from the snack shop
worked her magic.

00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:07.330
After all, I used to run Miso Snack Bar
back in the day.

00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:22.610
This is delicious.

00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:25.780
But wait.

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:27.850
Did you say, "Miso Snack Bar"?

00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:30.250
That's the same as my daughter's name.

00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:32.120
My daughter's name is Mi So.

00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:36.790
That's right.
Your daughter's name is Mi So.

00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:39.430
She was so sweet and pretty.

00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:43.400
You seem to know my daughter well.

00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:47.440
Of course. I know her very well.
How could I not?

00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:51.570
Please, tell me about my daughter.

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:54.810
It's strange.
All I can remember is her name.

00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:59.650
What kind of a mother am I?

00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:04.020
Don't say that, Kyung Chae.

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:08.190
Even if you can't remember,

00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:11.090
I'll keep telling you all about Mi So.

00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:16.330
Because for me,

00:28:17.270 --> 00:28:20.700
remembering her is how I keep going.

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:23.310
I'm such a terrible mother.

00:28:24.570 --> 00:28:26.280
I can't even remember my own daughter.

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:29.550
What mother in the world does that?

00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:32.050
No, that's not true.

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:36.690
You're the best mother in the world.

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:40.360
I'm the best mother...

00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:43.060
in the world?

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:51.800
You're the best mother in the world.

00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:06.350
