01:43.792 --> 01:45.500
- Oh man.
- Wow.

01:51.708 --> 01:53.917
I haven't been here
since I was a little kid.

01:54.583 --> 01:56.416
I thought you grew up here.

01:56.417 --> 01:58.208
Like round the corner.

02:01.083 --> 02:03.208
I knocked my tooth out on that step.

02:06.708 --> 02:08.292
Got me brain damaged.

02:13.750 --> 02:17.167
It's not New York but it's ours.

02:18.083 --> 02:20.125
I think it's gonna be pretty sick.

02:35.375 --> 02:36.375
Yeah?

02:45.792 --> 02:48.749
- I could send for my drum kit?
- No way.

02:48.750 --> 02:50.083
No?

02:54.042 --> 02:55.207
My uncle was a hoarder.

02:55.208 --> 02:58.625
I didn't realise how much space
there was in here.

02:59.500 --> 03:00.749
It's peaceful.

03:00.750 --> 03:03.500
I can just record
an album out here so easily.

03:06.083 --> 03:08.291
- Gracie!
- What?

03:08.292 --> 03:09.917
I found an office!

03:12.625 --> 03:15.000
You can write
your Great American Novel up here.

03:15.625 --> 03:17.374
Whoa!

03:17.375 --> 03:19.167
What?

03:21.292 --> 03:24.125
It's alright.
It's just a little rat situation.

03:26.542 --> 03:28.082
We should get a cat.

03:28.083 --> 03:31.875
You can write all day, every day.
Nothing but the birds singing.

03:34.833 --> 03:36.542
How did he die?

03:40.917 --> 03:42.625
I don't know.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.125
Here we are.

04:16.708 --> 04:18.125
We need a broom.

06:16.208 --> 06:17.916
Hey, hey, hey.

06:17.917 --> 06:19.125
Hey!

06:20.458 --> 06:21.500
Hey.

06:26.250 --> 06:28.750
Hey! Where's your mommy?

06:29.542 --> 06:31.250
Pumpkin, where's your mommy?

06:44.500 --> 06:46.208
Oh, no!

06:59.125 --> 07:00.833
Where's Mommy?

07:22.417 --> 07:24.125
Oh, God.

07:26.792 --> 07:27.875
Grace.

07:57.792 --> 07:59.000
Mom wanted to stop by.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.208
Oh?

08:04.000 --> 08:07.374
I told her it wasn't a big deal.
It's like a "us" thing.

08:07.375 --> 08:09.583
And it's just for six months,
anyway, so...

08:14.125 --> 08:15.582
I just feel kind of bad,

08:15.583 --> 08:18.958
'cause I think she just wants the company.

08:19.750 --> 08:21.625
I don't mind her coming.

08:24.625 --> 08:28.625
It's weird. It's like she doesn't
know how to function any more.

08:29.542 --> 08:32.832
She's still cooking for two people.
Did she tell you that?

08:33.792 --> 08:35.500
It's too sweet.

08:36.042 --> 08:38.167
Yeah? No, it's nice.

08:39.832 --> 08:40.957
He liked it.

08:43.582 --> 08:45.667
A real mom would have baked a cake.

08:52.375 --> 08:53.792
Want another one?

08:58.333 --> 09:00.542
Why is it so fuckin' hot?

09:01.833 --> 09:03.583
"Why is it so fuckin' hot?"

09:04.750 --> 09:06.832
"Why is it so fuckin' hot?"

09:06.833 --> 09:08.625
It's always hot.

11:42.208 --> 11:43.417
Boy's asleep.

12:17.500 --> 12:18.917
You wanna look?

12:22.000 --> 12:24.250
How can you not give a shit
about the stars, Grace?

12:24.958 --> 12:27.708
Well, they make me feel like... nothing.

12:29.583 --> 12:32.833
I like that they make me feel like I'm
part of something bigger.

12:34.583 --> 12:36.124
You like to feel like nothing?

12:36.125 --> 12:37.166
No.

12:37.167 --> 12:39.958
You know how many universes
there are out there?

12:40.708 --> 12:43.874
What are we doing in
the different universe? Are we together?

12:43.875 --> 12:45.042
Sure we are.

12:46.667 --> 12:48.208
Am I a rock star?

12:49.958 --> 12:52.000
Can you sing in a different universe?

12:52.542 --> 12:53.708
Hey.

12:54.458 --> 12:56.333
Yeah, I'm sure you're a rock star.

12:58.500 --> 12:59.583
Do we fuck?

13:04.750 --> 13:05.958
All the time?

13:07.625 --> 13:08.625
Hey, what?

13:09.375 --> 13:11.083
Do. We. Fuck?

13:13.000 --> 13:14.417
Like rabbits.

13:28.083 --> 13:29.333
Do you hear him?

13:30.500 --> 13:31.542
No.

13:34.125 --> 13:35.625
He's crying. Listen.

13:37.333 --> 13:38.917
Grace, it's totally silent.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.250
Am I boring you?

13:46.833 --> 13:49.458
Not you. The universe.
Who gives a shit?

13:58.500 --> 13:59.666
<i>...and a wild party mom...</i>

13:59.667 --> 14:03.666
<i>I'm very well known as Big Bouncy,
the over-the-hill party girl.</i>

14:03.667 --> 14:05.583
<i>...swap lives for two weeks.</i>

14:07.042 --> 14:09.042
- <i>I hope you survive.</i>
- <i>Bye!</i>

14:10.042 --> 14:11.374
<i>Nice to meet you.</i>

14:11.375 --> 14:14.082
<i>Loretta's appearance,
I don't think it's appropriate.</i>

14:14.083 --> 14:16.582
<i>We are two worlds apart.</i>

14:16.583 --> 14:19.332
<i>I've never seen anything good
come out of alcohol.</i>

14:19.333 --> 14:21.499
<i>I've never killed an animal before.</i>

14:21.500 --> 14:23.582
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

14:23.583 --> 14:25.041
<i>I'm talking!</i>

14:25.042 --> 14:27.333
<i>I've never seen
a more disrespectful child.</i>

16:02.500 --> 16:04.208
<i>Does it feel like a girl?</i>

16:05.458 --> 16:07.167
<i>What does a girl feel like?</i>

16:07.667 --> 16:11.167
<i>If it moves more on the right,
then you're probably having a boy.</i>

16:12.625 --> 16:14.042
<i>You didn't wanna know?</i>

16:17.667 --> 16:23.416
Grace, I... didn't find out
what I was having either.

16:23.417 --> 16:24.707
I think that's nice.

16:24.708 --> 16:26.999
You didn't find out
'cause you wanted a girl.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.083
Ha, ha.

16:28.833 --> 16:31.041
Oh, gosh. He forgets to drink.

16:31.042 --> 16:33.707
- Harry, you gotta have a drink.
- He's fine.

16:33.708 --> 16:36.499
No, I wanted a baby.
I wanted whoever was in there.

16:36.500 --> 16:38.207
Yeah? And you got Jackson?

16:38.208 --> 16:39.707
Unlucky.

16:39.708 --> 16:41.167
I heard that, Auntie Jen.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.500
Are you off your food, Grace?

16:46.958 --> 16:48.832
- Leave her alone.
- You didn't eat.

16:48.833 --> 16:51.625
Being pregnant
makes your stomach shrink.

16:52.333 --> 16:53.416
That's bullshit.

16:53.417 --> 16:55.707
It's sucking on you
every minute of the day.

16:55.708 --> 16:58.249
Then you'll be famished.
I couldn't get enough in me.

16:58.250 --> 16:59.957
That never went away, did it?

16:59.958 --> 17:01.791
You can talk.
What's your excuse?

17:01.792 --> 17:05.958
Never had a baby in there but always
ate as though you just dropped triplets.

17:07.791 --> 17:10.082
You know, Grace,
if you get a screamer...

17:10.083 --> 17:11.999
She's not gonna get a screamer.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.124
- Jackson was a screamer.
- That's a lie.

17:14.125 --> 17:15.666
Jackson was a sweetheart.

17:16.666 --> 17:19.707
The point is, if you do,
let the baby cry.

17:19.708 --> 17:23.082
Just walk away from it.
Don't let yourself get tired, stressed.

17:23.083 --> 17:25.040
That's a horrible thing to say.

17:25.041 --> 17:26.832
Slow fuckin' death.

17:26.833 --> 17:30.457
If you're not at your best, it's no good
for anyone, especially the baby.

17:30.458 --> 17:33.082
And a crying baby
doesn't mean it's in pain.

17:33.083 --> 17:35.832
It's the only way they have
of communicating.

17:35.833 --> 17:36.916
No, it's not.

17:36.917 --> 17:39.833
People only say that so they can walk
away from their kid.

17:40.625 --> 17:42.874
Anyway, all I do is take care of Harry.

17:42.875 --> 17:44.416
- Barely.
- If you need me...

17:44.417 --> 17:46.957
- She doesn't.
- ...we're just a walk away.

17:46.958 --> 17:50.000
What you doing in here, Pop?
Wanna watch the Grizzlies?

17:51.667 --> 17:53.417
Wanna open some of those presents?

17:53.958 --> 17:56.625
- Whose presents?
- For the baby.

17:57.208 --> 18:00.457
No, I gotta sort out these shoes.

18:00.458 --> 18:03.208
- Okay.
- They're the wrong ones.

18:04.542 --> 18:06.249
They look good to me.

18:06.250 --> 18:09.832
- You had enough to eat, Mom?
- Honey, I'm stuffed.

18:09.833 --> 18:12.417
Would you get your dad
something to drink, please?

18:15.083 --> 18:16.792
No more pie.

18:19.375 --> 18:21.083
Well, I'm stuffed.

18:22.208 --> 18:24.666
Can't stop eating.
It's the same every holiday.

18:24.667 --> 18:26.832
Well, you can.
You've always been skinny.

18:26.833 --> 18:28.582
Grace likes me lean.
Don't you, baby?

18:28.583 --> 18:30.833
You can starve in January.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.291
What are y'all doing?
Why are y'all here?

18:35.292 --> 18:37.457
This is Frank's house.

18:37.458 --> 18:38.999
It's his house.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.541
Harry, this is Grace and Jackson's--

18:41.542 --> 18:43.874
No, this is my brother's house.

18:43.875 --> 18:46.416
Sweetheart, Frank's not here.

18:46.417 --> 18:48.917
Get out of my brother's house!

19:19.833 --> 19:21.208
Jackson.

19:44.625 --> 19:46.208
Harry.

20:00.792 --> 20:01.875
Harry!

20:10.625 --> 20:12.250
Did you find the right size?

20:23.792 --> 20:24.875
Hello.

20:26.292 --> 20:27.375
Hello.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.957
Is it a baby?

20:36.958 --> 20:39.042
- A baby.
- A boy?

20:39.958 --> 20:42.832
I don't know. I think, maybe.

20:42.833 --> 20:44.000
It is.

20:44.958 --> 20:46.082
Oh?

20:46.083 --> 20:48.167
Don't leave him to cry.

20:50.417 --> 20:51.792
I won't.

20:52.625 --> 20:55.042
You know,
when he comes, he's a cat.

20:55.958 --> 20:58.417
He's a bear and a baby.

20:59.250 --> 21:03.667
And he's you, he's all of you.
He's gonna be so funny.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.791
Hi. Find everything you're looking for?

23:17.792 --> 23:19.375
In life?

23:20.417 --> 23:22.124
Any gas for your car?

23:22.125 --> 23:24.041
- No.
- Alrighty.

23:24.042 --> 23:27.749
I love this stuff. Whatever they put
in that powder, it's like magic.

23:27.750 --> 23:30.041
It's two for six dollars
if you want another.

23:30.042 --> 23:31.499
- I'm good.
- This one's four.

23:31.500 --> 23:33.374
- And the other one is two.
- I get it.

23:33.375 --> 23:35.374
- No, thanks.
- He's a boy, right?

23:35.375 --> 23:38.874
He's so cute.
Hi there, handsome.

23:38.875 --> 23:40.750
Hi there, sweetie-pie.

23:41.750 --> 23:43.541
- Does he have a name?
- No.

23:43.542 --> 23:45.333
We decided not to name him.

23:47.583 --> 23:50.582
How old are you, sweetie?
Wait. Let me guess.

23:50.583 --> 23:54.541
I'm really good at this.
About six months?

23:54.542 --> 23:56.457
Why are you talking?

23:56.458 --> 23:59.291
Do you ever think about
what you're gonna say?

23:59.292 --> 24:02.750
Or do you just open your mouth
and blah, blah, blah, blah?

24:04.542 --> 24:07.417
In about 30 seconds, I'll be gone.
We don't need to speak.

24:14.042 --> 24:15.083
Okay.

26:00.250 --> 26:04.875
Alrighty.

26:07.125 --> 26:08.125
Alrighty.

26:20.917 --> 26:23.208
Alrighty. Alrighty. Alrighty.

26:53.417 --> 26:55.125
- Hey.
- Hey.

26:57.625 --> 26:59.332
What you doing up, little bug?

26:59.333 --> 27:00.457
I was bored.

27:00.458 --> 27:02.542
You got bored,
so you kept the baby up?

27:03.625 --> 27:05.000
I got somethin' for you.

27:09.417 --> 27:12.708
What the fuck, Jackson?
You got a dog?

27:13.292 --> 27:14.500
Got a dog.

27:16.375 --> 27:17.916
Look at him.

27:17.917 --> 27:19.708
We need a cat.

27:21.708 --> 27:24.457
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

27:24.458 --> 27:26.874
Good dog. Good baby.

27:26.875 --> 27:28.625
You're a good baby. Yes, you are.

27:31.792 --> 27:32.917
Hey.

27:39.917 --> 27:40.958
Come here.

27:43.083 --> 27:46.000
Come on.
Everyone but me.

27:47.167 --> 27:48.417
Yeah.

27:51.708 --> 27:53.083
Hey.

27:55.958 --> 27:57.417
Wanna see some magic?

28:02.417 --> 28:04.125
Wanna see a magic trick?

28:14.083 --> 28:15.582
Gonna sit nice?

28:15.583 --> 28:17.541
Yeah, sit.

28:17.542 --> 28:19.000
That's a good boy.

28:19.875 --> 28:21.083
That's a good boy.

28:41.375 --> 28:44.583
Stir it up.
You stir it up.

28:50.500 --> 28:52.208
Second.

28:53.625 --> 28:54.875
Magic.

30:29.208 --> 30:31.375
Ready?
We're ready to steer. Okay.

30:32.833 --> 30:34.542
Ready to drive?

30:35.500 --> 30:37.500
To the moon.

30:41.125 --> 30:43.375
And a left to New York.

30:48.500 --> 30:51.792
What is that?
Do you feel that?

31:04.542 --> 31:06.542
<i>Where are you now?</i>

31:07.292 --> 31:10.292
<i>In a burger place
outside of Nampa. 84.</i>

31:12.167 --> 31:13.375
<i>You're eating?</i>

31:14.250 --> 31:15.583
Mm-hm.

31:16.458 --> 31:18.041
<i>A burger?</i>

31:18.042 --> 31:19.250
<i>Yep.</i>

31:21.250 --> 31:23.917
- Is it good?
<i>- Yeah, it's alright.</i>

31:28.875 --> 31:30.875
Well, what else have you been doing?

31:31.833 --> 31:33.124
<i>Working.</i>

31:33.125 --> 31:36.125
Uh-huh. What else?

31:39.542 --> 31:41.291
Is everything alright?

31:41.292 --> 31:45.125
<i>I'm asking you about your day.
This is a conversation.</i>

31:50.208 --> 31:52.875
- What have you been up to?
- Nothin'.

31:55.667 --> 31:57.375
<i>Have you been writing?</i>

31:59.583 --> 32:01.624
<i>I'll call you
when I get closer, okay?</i>

32:01.625 --> 32:03.707
Well, are you gonna wanna eat?

32:03.708 --> 32:07.625
<i>Yeah, we can have dinner when I get back.
It's gonna be kind of late, though.</i>

32:08.292 --> 32:10.333
<i>Anything else for you?</i>

32:11.583 --> 32:13.583
<i>What sounds good for supper?</i>

32:15.708 --> 32:16.874
<i>How's the boy?</i>

32:16.875 --> 32:18.666
He's sleeping.

32:18.667 --> 32:21.624
<i>- Hey, darlin'. Here's your check.
- Alright, talk later.</i>

32:21.625 --> 32:22.916
<i>Thank you, baby.</i>

32:22.917 --> 32:24.708
Okay. Bye.

34:29.083 --> 34:30.208
Pam?

34:47.417 --> 34:48.625
Pam?

34:58.792 --> 34:59.917
Pam?

35:25.000 --> 35:26.125
Pam?

35:28.458 --> 35:32.333
Fuck! Oh, goddammit.

35:32.917 --> 35:34.082
Pam, what the hell?

35:34.083 --> 35:35.500
You snuck in.

35:36.292 --> 35:37.625
I didn't sneak.

35:38.792 --> 35:40.499
I brought the baby.

35:40.500 --> 35:42.500
- You brought the baby.
- He's asleep.

35:43.542 --> 35:45.332
- That's nice.
- Yeah.

35:45.333 --> 35:48.249
As long as you don't blow my brains out.

35:48.250 --> 35:49.874
That thing loaded, Pam?

35:49.875 --> 35:52.332
Oh, yeah. It's Harry's.

35:52.333 --> 35:54.667
He used to sleep with it next to him.

35:55.708 --> 35:57.417
Made him feel safe.

36:00.875 --> 36:02.707
I don't know
what to do with it now.

36:02.708 --> 36:04.708
I don't know what to do
with any of it.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.708
I never do my hair.

36:10.833 --> 36:12.667
It's pretty.

36:13.250 --> 36:15.042
Harry likes it loose.

36:15.875 --> 36:17.667
Yeah?

36:23.542 --> 36:24.958
You sleeping at all?

36:25.875 --> 36:28.542
Oh... you know.

36:29.917 --> 36:31.917
Jackson says
you've been sleepwalking.

36:34.750 --> 36:36.792
Oh, yeah. That.

36:38.208 --> 36:39.333
You get far?

36:40.417 --> 36:43.583
Woke up on Culver Road
screaming my head off.

36:45.125 --> 36:47.042
Never done anything like that before.

36:52.042 --> 36:54.208
Nothing seems real since...

36:55.792 --> 36:57.167
since he died.

37:00.083 --> 37:03.500
My brain just seems... chopped up.

37:19.500 --> 37:25.375
Yeah. I'm your grandma.
Yeah, I am.

37:33.875 --> 37:37.250
It's so wonderful the two of you
have taken on the house.

37:38.667 --> 37:40.083
Mm-hm.

37:43.042 --> 37:47.500
He was... such a happy little guy, Frank.

37:49.417 --> 37:51.624
He shot himself?

37:51.625 --> 37:54.124
- Uncle Frank?
- Yes.

37:54.125 --> 37:56.167
And you found him?

37:56.875 --> 37:58.457
I did.

37:58.458 --> 38:02.292
- That must have been awful.
- Yes, I did. It was.

38:04.917 --> 38:06.333
It was.

38:09.167 --> 38:10.375
In the head?

38:13.458 --> 38:14.875
In the head?

38:16.000 --> 38:17.208
No.

38:19.042 --> 38:22.083
- I can't...
- Well, where, then?

38:23.458 --> 38:25.625
The heart? Chest?

38:27.292 --> 38:28.500
No.

38:30.625 --> 38:32.624
- Legs, feet, back?
- No.

38:32.625 --> 38:34.541
- Arms? Stomach?
- No, no.

38:34.542 --> 38:36.333
Dick?

38:36.958 --> 38:38.542
- Grace.
- Ass?

38:39.875 --> 38:43.833
Oh, my God. He shot himself
in his own ass intentionally?

38:49.375 --> 38:51.917
You know, he looks just like you.

38:53.708 --> 38:57.792
- Uncle Frank?
- No. The baby, you goose.

38:59.917 --> 39:01.041
You think?

39:01.042 --> 39:03.875
Yeah. Yeah.

39:10.000 --> 39:14.042
Grace, you know, everybody
goes a little loopy the first year.

39:17.417 --> 39:19.250
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

39:20.167 --> 39:22.916
You and Harry have known
each other your whole lives.

39:22.917 --> 39:24.624
Of course you're gonna go
a bit loopy.

39:24.625 --> 39:27.749
No, no. I mean you.

39:27.750 --> 39:29.749
After a baby.

39:29.750 --> 39:32.541
My mother went nuts.
Jen lost it.

39:32.542 --> 39:37.625
I didn't feel myself for a while.
But you'll... you'll...

39:40.958 --> 39:42.375
You'll come back.

39:47.833 --> 39:49.250
You know...

39:52.625 --> 39:55.583
- if you're having a hard time--
- I feel fine.

39:57.000 --> 39:58.792
We'll come again soon.

39:59.917 --> 40:01.625
Thanks for the tea.

40:18.292 --> 40:19.917
Who's pushing you?

40:21.708 --> 40:23.333
Is that a ghost?

40:31.917 --> 40:34.832
<i>Red and yellow</i>

40:34.833 --> 40:39.666
<i>And pink and green</i>

40:39.667 --> 40:46.125
<i>Purple and orange and blue</i>

40:47.500 --> 40:51.958
<i>I can sing a rainbow</i>

40:52.500 --> 40:55.750
<i>Sing a rainbow</i>

40:56.583 --> 41:03.042
<i>Sing a rainbow too</i>

41:14.958 --> 41:18.708
<i>Listen with your eyes</i>

41:19.375 --> 41:22.874
<i>Listen with your eyes</i>

41:22.875 --> 41:28.125
<i>And sing everything you see</i>

43:36.250 --> 43:37.542
What the fuck do you want?

43:46.708 --> 43:48.333
Cut your lip.

43:51.667 --> 43:52.875
Cut it.

44:32.208 --> 44:35.208
Woof, woof, woof.
Boop, boop, boop.

44:49.542 --> 44:50.625
Just gonna leave it?

44:51.458 --> 44:53.166
He's your girlfriend.
You clean it.

44:53.167 --> 44:54.457
Nice.

44:54.458 --> 44:56.791
He pissed on the floor too.

44:56.792 --> 44:59.166
You should make better choices
in who you bring home.

44:59.167 --> 45:01.041
- Fuck's sake, Grace.
- You're mad at me?

45:01.042 --> 45:03.166
Why didn't you let him out,
you whack job?

45:03.167 --> 45:04.417
He's not my problem.

45:05.875 --> 45:08.374
Just put him on his leash,
take him out the back

45:08.375 --> 45:10.416
until he gets used to where he is.

45:10.417 --> 45:13.041
Yeah, I'm not gonna train
your fucking dog.

45:13.042 --> 45:16.041
- We have a baby.
- No shit.

45:16.042 --> 45:19.082
I can't have this...
This place is a fucking hole.

45:19.083 --> 45:21.624
- And you moved us into it.
- I am working.

45:21.625 --> 45:24.291
When I come home,
I'm the one cleaning everything up.

45:24.292 --> 45:27.707
Yeah, three days a week.
Let me shower you in medals.

45:27.708 --> 45:31.082
- Shut up.
- You have an ashtray on the carpet.

45:31.083 --> 45:34.541
- You don't think the baby's eating that?
- Shut up.

45:34.542 --> 45:37.166
Move us into the house
where your uncle shot himself

45:37.167 --> 45:38.499
up the fucking ass.

45:38.500 --> 45:41.583
- Oh, my God.
- Up the ass. Up the fucking ass.

45:42.208 --> 45:44.208
- Stop.
- I knew it. I knew it.

45:45.583 --> 45:48.791
Why are your shorts undone?
Why do you not have your shorts on?

45:48.792 --> 45:50.166
- Shut up.
- Jesus Chr--

45:50.167 --> 45:52.041
Fucking sanctimonious dick.

45:52.042 --> 45:54.624
You probably pissed on the floor.
Blamed it on the dog.

45:54.625 --> 45:57.082
It was your mangy dog.
And "sanctimonious" means

45:57.083 --> 45:59.874
you think you're morally
superior to others, dummy.

45:59.875 --> 46:02.291
- How's the book going, by the way?
- Fantastic, thank you!

46:02.292 --> 46:03.874
Your Great American Novel.

46:03.875 --> 46:07.249
The main character's about to batter
her husband to death with a hammer.

46:07.250 --> 46:10.416
- Sounds like shit.
- Well, you can't read, so...

46:10.417 --> 46:13.832
Maybe if I spend a little less time
with my hands down my pants

46:13.833 --> 46:15.707
and a little more time writing,

46:15.708 --> 46:19.082
maybe I'd write something, maybe.

46:19.083 --> 46:20.416
My hands are
down my pants

46:20.417 --> 46:23.333
'cause you put your dick everywhere
except there, asshole!

46:35.917 --> 46:39.124
- You're gonna wake up the baby.
- Now you're worried about the baby.

46:39.125 --> 46:41.791
I'm always worried
about the fucking baby.

46:41.792 --> 46:43.457
- We're going for a drive.
- No.

46:43.458 --> 46:44.457
- Yes! We are.
- No.

46:44.458 --> 46:45.791
- Get in, Grace.
- Fuck off.

46:45.792 --> 46:47.707
- We need to talk.
- We can talk here.

46:47.708 --> 46:50.250
- Get in the fucking car!
- Fucking no!

46:50.958 --> 46:52.624
Jackson,
I'm not leaving the baby.

46:52.625 --> 46:53.999
Stop, stop, stop.

46:54.000 --> 46:55.666
I'm not leaving the baby.
Jackson!

46:55.667 --> 46:57.999
- The baby's fine.
- Stop! Stop! Stop!

46:58.000 --> 47:00.625
You're a fucking... fucking asshole!

47:03.208 --> 47:04.958
What is wrong with you?

47:09.583 --> 47:11.457
- Seriously?
- Give me the belt.

47:11.458 --> 47:12.958
Oh, my God.

47:16.583 --> 47:18.000
Don't you dare
open the door.

47:23.625 --> 47:25.083
Gracie.

47:32.167 --> 47:34.542
I was just...

47:35.250 --> 47:36.583
Hey, bud, don't...

47:38.292 --> 47:40.500
Stop. Stop.

47:56.250 --> 47:58.416
Look, okay, I... I just think

47:58.417 --> 48:02.291
we need to have a schedule
or somethin', or just...

48:02.292 --> 48:04.708
I just wanna make a plan 'cause I...

48:07.792 --> 48:10.541
Grace, I don't want you to think
that I don't appreciate

48:10.542 --> 48:13.332
everything that you do, I just...

48:13.333 --> 48:18.667
Like, you're the glue,
you're the one, you're the OG, but...

48:21.083 --> 48:25.624
If you're not feeling good,
then, I don't know,

48:25.625 --> 48:27.667
maybe we should,
like, talk about it.

48:31.042 --> 48:33.042
I just want you to know
that I'm here.

48:35.917 --> 48:42.667
Having a baby is like the most
monumental fucking thing and...

48:43.917 --> 48:46.957
I get that, I want you to know
how much I get that,

48:46.958 --> 48:50.125
and if you wanna talk about it, then...

48:50.708 --> 48:52.250
Can we turn this off?

48:53.000 --> 48:54.832
What?

48:54.833 --> 48:57.208
The music.
Can we turn it off?

48:58.292 --> 49:00.708
- It's a classic.
- Okay.

49:02.458 --> 49:04.792
I don't care.
I hate it. I hate guitars.

49:05.792 --> 49:07.792
- Since when?
- Since forever.

49:10.000 --> 49:12.333
What? That's insane.
Who hates guitars?

49:13.542 --> 49:15.375
You don't hate guitars.

49:16.250 --> 49:19.291
Grace. I know what you're thinking,
but that's just an old pack.

49:19.292 --> 49:22.082
It's been there forever.
You've seen them before.

49:22.083 --> 49:24.457
- I've seen these before?
- Yes.

49:24.458 --> 49:27.291
Look, they're just... they're Greg's.

49:27.292 --> 49:31.542
Wow, you and Greg are <i>very, very</i> close.

49:39.458 --> 49:41.000
Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.

49:41.833 --> 49:44.625
Stop it. Grace,
stop being fucking annoying.

50:38.625 --> 50:40.375
I'm coming!

50:44.667 --> 50:45.958
I'm here, baby.

51:12.375 --> 51:14.250
He's not breathing.

51:15.625 --> 51:16.958
Funny.

52:15.917 --> 52:17.125
Fuck it.

53:14.458 --> 53:15.583
Harry?

54:15.708 --> 54:17.125
Up.

54:17.917 --> 54:19.125
Grace?

54:23.542 --> 54:25.250
You have to shoot the dog.

54:27.042 --> 54:28.249
What?

54:28.250 --> 54:30.417
You have to shoot the fucking dog.

54:33.125 --> 54:34.542
He's crying.

54:36.333 --> 54:39.707
- Where the fuck did you find that?
- A thing you love is suffering.

54:39.708 --> 54:41.916
- Have you lost your mind?
- You can solve it.

54:41.917 --> 54:45.166
- Are you insane?
- He's in pain.

54:45.167 --> 54:47.791
- I'll go to the vets tomorrow.
- They'll put him down.

54:47.792 --> 54:52.000
Grace, please!
I'm not gonna kill my dog. Okay?

56:00.958 --> 56:02.583
How's your lip?

57:43.500 --> 57:45.250
I'm sorry.

58:04.833 --> 58:06.833
How do you start your days, Grace?

58:08.958 --> 58:10.957
What do you mean?

58:10.958 --> 58:14.042
Well, yoga?

58:15.292 --> 58:17.583
Running?
Hot water and lemon?

58:18.792 --> 58:20.417
Writing?

58:24.500 --> 58:26.500
What's happened with your writing?

58:27.792 --> 58:29.542
I can't do it any more.

58:31.208 --> 58:32.833
Why not?

58:42.208 --> 58:44.499
- You know who's teaching yoga?
- Who?

58:44.500 --> 58:48.291
That neighbour of yours, Melissa?

58:48.292 --> 58:51.082
She does it over the internet. She...

58:51.083 --> 58:53.167
Maybe you could take a class with her?

58:55.917 --> 58:57.666
I don't think that's yoga, Pam.

58:57.667 --> 59:00.875
I'm pretty sure it is.

59:05.208 --> 59:10.792
Well, it might be a relaxing thing
for a young woman to do.

59:18.708 --> 59:21.917
You're still so pretty, Grace.

59:24.833 --> 59:26.875
Let me help you, sweetie.

59:28.333 --> 59:33.124
Just with the baby, with...
with the house, whatever you need.

59:33.125 --> 59:36.832
Just give you more time
to do other things.

59:36.833 --> 59:40.791
- Alright.
- You found some.

59:40.792 --> 59:42.167
It's the good stuff, Mom.

59:43.208 --> 59:47.875
I know this brand.
This is the hot one.

59:49.500 --> 59:52.250
- I'm going for a walk. I won't be long.
- Grace?

01:01:51.250 --> 01:01:54.749
- Grace! Can you hear us?
- Grace!

01:01:54.750 --> 01:01:58.917
Grace!

01:02:04.875 --> 01:02:08.582
She took your baby
and disappeared for hours.

01:02:08.583 --> 01:02:10.417
Had you frantic.

01:02:11.625 --> 01:02:13.625
And now she's not talking to you?

01:02:15.083 --> 01:02:19.625
She just needs some time to herself.
You know, I get that.

01:02:20.708 --> 01:02:25.207
No, Jackson.
She is not well.

01:02:25.208 --> 01:02:27.958
Well, sometimes people aren't well, Mom.

01:02:29.542 --> 01:02:33.082
Sometimes people need some time
to adjust when things change.

01:02:33.083 --> 01:02:36.416
Sometimes everybody just needs
to have some fucking patience

01:02:36.417 --> 01:02:38.625
and trust that things will get better.

01:02:40.667 --> 01:02:42.667
Are you still sleepwalking?

01:02:45.417 --> 01:02:47.667
I'm just trying to help.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.875
Well, you are helping, Mom.

01:02:56.125 --> 01:02:59.542
She just needs some space
to... to write.

01:03:00.875 --> 01:03:02.875
She says she can't.

01:03:05.083 --> 01:03:07.416
It's just like, you know...

01:03:07.417 --> 01:03:10.750
It's just writer's block
or whatever, I guess.

01:04:09.625 --> 01:04:12.750
No. I don't wanna get in.

01:04:15.333 --> 01:04:18.416
Okay, there we are.
Good job.

01:04:18.417 --> 01:04:21.166
- Hi.
- Alright, that's a big girl.

01:04:21.167 --> 01:04:24.082
- That's a big girl.
- I don't wanna go.

01:04:24.083 --> 01:04:25.707
It's okay.

01:04:25.708 --> 01:04:28.791
- Sorry to bother you.
- Huh?

01:04:28.792 --> 01:04:31.249
I think my car might have
a flat tyre.

01:04:31.250 --> 01:04:34.457
Would you mind
just taking a look at it?

01:04:34.458 --> 01:04:35.624
- Breathe.
- No.

01:04:35.625 --> 01:04:38.416
Look at Mommy.
Hey, look at Mommy.

01:04:38.417 --> 01:04:41.333
Babe, we don't have any time for this. No.

01:04:42.292 --> 01:04:45.749
So, could you...

01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:49.207
Okay. Yeah, sorry.

01:04:49.208 --> 01:04:51.292
Put your leg in the car.

01:04:59.333 --> 01:05:00.958
Alright?

01:05:08.958 --> 01:05:11.208
When was the last time we had sex?

01:05:13.292 --> 01:05:14.917
Rough guess.

01:05:17.417 --> 01:05:19.249
I really couldn't say, Gracie.

01:05:19.250 --> 01:05:22.167
Go on, take a stab.

01:05:25.542 --> 01:05:27.416
I don't know. Like a month?

01:05:27.417 --> 01:05:29.333
Try two and a half.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.999
Well, things have been, you know.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.582
And it was four in the morning,
you were essentially asleep.

01:05:35.583 --> 01:05:36.958
Grace.

01:05:38.083 --> 01:05:39.499
And the time before that,

01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:41.707
we were watching TV
about that island thing,

01:05:41.708 --> 01:05:44.374
and I was begging you,
and you put a towel down.

01:05:44.375 --> 01:05:45.958
Alright, alright, alright.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.333
It used to be good, right?

01:05:50.042 --> 01:05:51.249
It's still good, Grace.

01:05:51.250 --> 01:05:54.457
It doesn't exist, Jackson.
It's not a thing.

01:05:54.458 --> 01:05:56.624
Alright, I'm gonna put more
of an effort in.

01:05:56.625 --> 01:05:58.167
Tonight?

01:05:59.333 --> 01:06:00.707
- Okay.
- You want me?

01:06:00.708 --> 01:06:02.500
Yeah, I want you.

01:06:03.625 --> 01:06:05.458
Say it again.

01:06:07.083 --> 01:06:08.792
I... I want you, yeah.

01:06:12.958 --> 01:06:14.916
- Before or after dinner?
- Grace, man.

01:06:14.917 --> 01:06:17.833
- Just have a fucking opinion.
- Jesus fucking Christ!

01:06:22.917 --> 01:06:24.542
When we get home?

01:06:25.583 --> 01:06:26.999
Yeah.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.166
You'll fuck me when we get home?

01:06:29.167 --> 01:06:30.791
Yeah.

01:06:30.792 --> 01:06:32.375
In the car?

01:06:33.500 --> 01:06:34.666
If you like.

01:06:34.667 --> 01:06:37.667
We used to fuck in the car
all the time, remember?

01:06:38.458 --> 01:06:41.542
I'll unbuckle, I'll come over
to your seat and you'll fuck me?

01:06:42.292 --> 01:06:43.375
Yes.

01:06:49.792 --> 01:06:50.958
Yes.

01:07:03.875 --> 01:07:06.374
Come on.
My mom's right there.

01:07:06.375 --> 01:07:08.292
Fuck me quickly, then.

01:07:11.125 --> 01:07:12.583
I don't...

01:07:16.375 --> 01:07:18.542
Grace, come on.
I'm just kinda...

01:07:20.917 --> 01:07:23.291
You impotent piece of shit.

01:07:23.292 --> 01:07:25.833
You useless fucking faggot!

01:07:27.250 --> 01:07:31.166
You're fucking insane.
Fucking insane.

01:07:31.167 --> 01:07:33.083
Is everything okay?

01:09:02.082 --> 01:09:04.456
- Open the door. I need to use it.
- Piss outside.

01:09:04.457 --> 01:09:06.956
I don't need to piss.

01:09:06.957 --> 01:09:09.124
Shit in a bush. I don't care.

01:09:09.125 --> 01:09:11.750
Oh, God, Grace!

01:09:12.707 --> 01:09:14.207
Grace!

01:09:17.875 --> 01:09:21.375
I don't wanna shit in a bush.
I want... I wanna shit in the toilet.

01:09:25.375 --> 01:09:27.207
Come on, it's coming out.

01:09:29.375 --> 01:09:31.000
Come on.

01:09:32.457 --> 01:09:34.125
It's gonna be
all over the floor.

01:09:38.750 --> 01:09:41.542
I'm starting to smell it. Quick.

01:09:42.417 --> 01:09:44.082
Thank you.

01:09:48.417 --> 01:09:50.000
Jesus Christ.

01:10:13.708 --> 01:10:15.082
No running, please.

01:10:15.083 --> 01:10:17.625
- Hi. Hey! Come on in.
- Hey.

01:10:18.125 --> 01:10:19.166
Greg!

01:10:19.167 --> 01:10:22.624
Yeah. Greg said we have
enough food to feed a village.

01:10:22.625 --> 01:10:24.708
Well, that's what we've got, right?

01:10:25.833 --> 01:10:29.207
Well, you can add these, I guess.
They fell over in the car.

01:10:29.208 --> 01:10:30.707
They looked better before.

01:10:30.708 --> 01:10:32.291
What happened to your fingers?

01:10:32.292 --> 01:10:34.582
I burnt them
trying to bake you a cake.

01:10:34.583 --> 01:10:36.957
- Hey, man.
- There you are. Welcome, buddy.

01:10:36.958 --> 01:10:39.416
- Good to see you.
- You too, man.

01:10:39.417 --> 01:10:40.957
- Hi.
- The place looks great.

01:10:40.958 --> 01:10:43.707
He's such a beautiful baby.

01:10:43.708 --> 01:10:46.291
- Jack, let's get you a drink.
- Does he want a snack?

01:10:46.292 --> 01:10:49.457
- Sure. Whatever the kids are having.
- Okay. No allergies?

01:10:49.458 --> 01:10:50.625
No. I don't think so.

01:10:52.292 --> 01:10:55.000
Who's a sweetie-pie?
Here's Jack's boy.

01:11:02.542 --> 01:11:04.375
Did you guys see this?

01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:16.541
So do you think
you'll have another one?

01:11:16.542 --> 01:11:18.249
Yeah. Pregnant now.

01:11:18.250 --> 01:11:19.791
Cookin' up twins.

01:11:19.792 --> 01:11:22.417
What happened to your hands?

01:11:23.417 --> 01:11:25.750
You should see the wall.

01:11:26.917 --> 01:11:30.833
Yeah, I have two kids, and...

01:11:31.917 --> 01:11:35.332
two is a lot,
if I'm being honest.

01:11:35.333 --> 01:11:37.082
Seems like it.

01:11:37.083 --> 01:11:40.124
Babies, though,
babies are hard.

01:11:40.125 --> 01:11:41.874
Nobody talks about that enough.

01:11:41.875 --> 01:11:44.083
It's all anyone talks about.

01:11:44.708 --> 01:11:45.958
It changes you.

01:11:47.333 --> 01:11:50.542
I think I nearly lost my mind
for the first six months.

01:11:51.583 --> 01:11:53.625
When do you think
you'll be getting it back?

01:11:59.625 --> 01:12:04.125
You know, postnatal depression is so
much more common than people think.

01:12:06.750 --> 01:12:09.417
- What do you do for work, Grace?
- I don't.

01:12:12.667 --> 01:12:14.666
I'm stuck between
wanting to do something

01:12:14.667 --> 01:12:19.124
and not wanting to do...
anything at all.

01:12:19.125 --> 01:12:23.124
Hang on. Cheryl mentioned
that you're a writer.

01:12:23.125 --> 01:12:24.666
That's cute. That must be nice.

01:12:24.667 --> 01:12:26.749
Something you can squeeze
around a baby.

01:12:26.750 --> 01:12:30.667
- Yeah, I don't do that any more.
- Why not? Stuck for inspiration?

01:12:31.667 --> 01:12:33.417
I'm sure it'll come back.

01:12:47.375 --> 01:12:49.541
Grace?

01:12:49.542 --> 01:12:51.667
Grace!

01:12:52.250 --> 01:12:53.625
Oh, my God!

01:13:02.167 --> 01:13:04.667
Jackson? Jackson?
Look at me, okay? Hey.

01:13:06.333 --> 01:13:09.374
- Can you breathe?
- Somebody get some water.

01:13:09.375 --> 01:13:11.249
- Jackson?
- Let me call someone.

01:13:11.250 --> 01:13:12.916
- What, your chest hurts?
- Yeah.

01:13:12.917 --> 01:13:16.417
- You can breathe. Breathe with me.
- I think it's them at the door.

01:13:18.750 --> 01:13:20.167
Yeah. See?

01:13:24.167 --> 01:13:26.750
Yeah, you're okay. You're okay.

01:13:32.458 --> 01:13:33.500
He's okay.

01:13:37.042 --> 01:13:39.707
It's just kind of a wake-up call,
you know.

01:13:39.708 --> 01:13:42.042
We need to look out
for each other, Grace.

01:13:45.583 --> 01:13:48.583
I am getting really stressed.

01:13:49.667 --> 01:13:51.083
About what?

01:14:09.708 --> 01:14:11.833
No one took our pastries.
You see that?

01:14:14.417 --> 01:14:16.417
Well, there was a ton of food.

01:14:17.792 --> 01:14:20.875
- It's rude.
- They weren't being rude. Come on.

01:14:21.833 --> 01:14:23.667
You know what's rude, Grace?

01:14:24.375 --> 01:14:27.374
Getting into a pool full of kids
in your fucking underwear.

01:14:27.375 --> 01:14:29.499
That's what's rude.

01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:30.749
You embarrassed me.

01:14:30.750 --> 01:14:32.958
You embarrassed <i>us</i>.

01:14:41.833 --> 01:14:43.417
Grace. Grace!

01:14:44.042 --> 01:14:45.333
Goddammit!

01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:50.917
Fuck me. Jesus fucking Christ.

01:14:52.917 --> 01:14:54.917
Don't ever do that again.

01:14:57.958 --> 01:14:59.375
Alright?

01:15:06.167 --> 01:15:07.749
<i>When Amelia was a little girl,</i>

01:15:07.750 --> 01:15:10.541
<i>she liked to imagine
she could stretch her wings</i>

01:15:10.542 --> 01:15:12.999
<i>and fly like a bird.</i>

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.499
<i>One day she got to ride
on an airplane</i>

01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:19.207
<i>and liked it so much
she didn't wanna ever come down.</i>

01:15:19.208 --> 01:15:21.874
<i>The world looked so small,</i>

01:15:21.875 --> 01:15:24.957
the houses and cars were like toys.

01:15:24.958 --> 01:15:28.082
They flew for thousands of miles.

01:15:28.083 --> 01:15:30.500
Over oceans and jungles.

01:15:32.125 --> 01:15:35.957
Some people thought they were crazy.

01:15:35.958 --> 01:15:40.250
But Amelia wasn't afraid
of having a thousand adventures.

01:15:40.958 --> 01:15:45.332
So she flew on like a bird,
further than anyone had gone before,

01:15:45.333 --> 01:15:47.874
never to return.

01:15:47.875 --> 01:15:50.042
What the fuck?

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:16.833
You wanna get married?

01:20:24.333 --> 01:20:26.875
Yeah. Yeah, fuck, yeah.

01:21:50.667 --> 01:21:52.125
Oh, my God. Really?

01:22:44.333 --> 01:22:47.249
Kiss me.

01:22:47.250 --> 01:22:48.542
Grace.

01:22:50.792 --> 01:22:53.000
Kiss me. Kiss me.

01:23:31.333 --> 01:23:33.916
I don't know where Jackson is.

01:23:33.917 --> 01:23:37.125
Let's go find
that no-count husband of yours.

01:23:41.208 --> 01:23:42.583
Wow.

01:23:53.708 --> 01:23:57.916
Hello. This is the bride
in the bridal suite.

01:23:57.917 --> 01:24:01.541
I was wondering if I could get
a bucket of ice sent up to my room.

01:24:01.542 --> 01:24:04.749
<i>We've got an ice machine
on your floor</i>

01:24:04.750 --> 01:24:06.542
<i>at the end of the corridor there.</i>

01:24:08.667 --> 01:24:10.332
What's your name?

01:24:10.333 --> 01:24:11.417
<i>Charlie.</i>

01:24:12.667 --> 01:24:16.291
Charlie, would you mind
getting it for me, please?

01:24:16.292 --> 01:24:19.207
I'm a little indisposed.

01:24:19.208 --> 01:24:22.125
<i>We don't bring up ice, ma'am.</i>

01:24:24.458 --> 01:24:25.875
Okay.

01:24:29.125 --> 01:24:30.249
Are you still there?

01:24:30.250 --> 01:24:33.207
<i>Yes, ma'am. Is there anything else
I can help you with?</i>

01:24:33.208 --> 01:24:39.707
Well, my husband
is at the party downstairs.

01:24:39.708 --> 01:24:41.417
Our wedding.

01:24:43.667 --> 01:24:47.457
And I think it would be really nice

01:24:47.458 --> 01:24:52.082
if the champagne was cold for him
when we came up.

01:24:52.083 --> 01:24:53.332
<i>I understand.</i>

01:24:53.333 --> 01:24:56.083
I'm just trying to be a good wife.

01:24:56.583 --> 01:25:01.417
<i>Yes. Sorry,
but I can't help with that.</i>

01:25:02.500 --> 01:25:06.750
You have a really beautiful voice,
Charlie.

01:25:07.625 --> 01:25:08.916
<i>Thank you, ma'am.</i>

01:25:08.917 --> 01:25:11.708
<i>The beast in me</i>

01:25:14.583 --> 01:25:18.917
<i>Has had to learn to live with pain</i>

01:25:22.542 --> 01:25:26.875
<i>And how to shelter from the rain</i>

01:25:30.625 --> 01:25:35.207
<i>And in the twinkling of an eye</i>

01:25:35.208 --> 01:25:39.000
<i>Might have to be restrained</i>

01:25:41.833 --> 01:25:48.083
<i>God help the beast in me</i>

01:28:40.292 --> 01:28:42.625
<i>Must have been about three.</i>

01:28:43.542 --> 01:28:45.708
<i>My parents and I
went down to the beach.</i>

01:28:48.250 --> 01:28:52.250
<i>They must have been reading,
or maybe they fell asleep.</i>

01:28:55.375 --> 01:28:59.124
And I had my feet in the water,
and then this girl came up to me.

01:28:59.125 --> 01:29:01.749
She must have been about ten,

01:29:01.750 --> 01:29:06.500
but to me she seemed, you know,
like a... like a grown-up.

01:29:09.417 --> 01:29:13.250
And she took my hand
and we walked for a while.

01:29:15.833 --> 01:29:17.833
She bought me an ice pop.

01:29:20.792 --> 01:29:24.708
People would say how cute we were.

01:29:25.833 --> 01:29:27.667
It was really nice.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:34.874
And then as my parents realised
I was missing,

01:29:34.875 --> 01:29:38.707
and my mom was crying

01:29:38.708 --> 01:29:42.207
and my dad was really angry,

01:29:42.208 --> 01:29:45.000
and I remember just thinking,

01:29:49.375 --> 01:29:51.375
"I wish you weren't mine.

01:29:53.375 --> 01:29:58.083
"I wish I didn't belong to you."

01:30:01.083 --> 01:30:03.083
Where are your parents now, Grace?

01:30:06.417 --> 01:30:08.417
They died in a plane crash.

01:30:11.250 --> 01:30:13.458
- How old were you?
- Ten.

01:30:16.625 --> 01:30:18.750
It must have been terribly difficult.

01:30:24.125 --> 01:30:26.833
<i>Like, perhaps you have
some abandonment issues.</i>

01:30:30.333 --> 01:30:34.500
<i>Which makes it hard for you
to safely attach to people.</i>

01:30:46.458 --> 01:30:49.666
Your husband. To your son.

01:30:49.667 --> 01:30:52.250
I don't have a problem
attaching to my son.

01:30:53.333 --> 01:30:54.958
He's perfect.

01:30:56.792 --> 01:30:59.042
It's everything else that's fucked.

01:32:15.625 --> 01:32:17.750
Hi.

01:32:18.792 --> 01:32:20.625
Hi, baby.

01:32:21.792 --> 01:32:23.208
I missed you.

01:32:29.417 --> 01:32:31.208
What?

01:32:34.500 --> 01:32:36.374
You got a rental?

01:32:36.375 --> 01:32:39.666
No, it's ours.
I got it off Greg.

01:32:39.667 --> 01:32:41.749
With what money?

01:32:41.750 --> 01:32:44.583
Don't worry about it.
He's taking care of us.

01:32:48.708 --> 01:32:49.792
You like it?

01:32:50.958 --> 01:32:53.333
Yeah, it's cool. Big.

01:33:07.125 --> 01:33:09.125
Turn this up.
I love this song.

01:33:13.167 --> 01:33:14.874
Thought you didn't like guitars.

01:33:14.875 --> 01:33:16.958
When did I ever say that?
I love guitars.

01:33:24.542 --> 01:33:28.332
<i>Will you stay in our lovers' story?</i>

01:33:28.333 --> 01:33:31.291
<i>If you stay, you won't be sorry</i>

01:33:31.292 --> 01:33:34.250
<i>'Cause we believe in you</i>

01:33:35.500 --> 01:33:38.999
<i>Soon you'll grow, so take a chance</i>

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:43.458
<i>With a couple of kooks
hung up on romancing</i>

01:33:44.583 --> 01:33:47.542
<i>Will you stay in our lovers' story?</i>

01:33:48.125 --> 01:33:51.249
<i>If you stay, you won't be sorry</i>

01:33:51.250 --> 01:33:54.042
<i>'Cause we believe in you</i>

01:33:55.042 --> 01:33:57.875
<i>Soon you'll grow, so take a chance</i>

01:34:07.167 --> 01:34:09.333
Doing alright there, bud?
Come on, now.

01:34:17.917 --> 01:34:19.666
He's so cute.

01:34:19.667 --> 01:34:21.333
I love his little hat.

01:34:22.417 --> 01:34:24.292
He's not really a fan.
Are you, buddy?

01:34:25.250 --> 01:34:28.167
I babysit a kid just like him.
Yours is cuter, though.

01:34:28.958 --> 01:34:31.541
- Has he been in the water yet?
- No, not yet.

01:34:31.542 --> 01:34:34.666
We could take him to the edge.
Do you think he'll go with us?

01:34:34.667 --> 01:34:37.707
Yeah. You're very social, aren't you?

01:34:37.708 --> 01:34:39.667
We can make him a castle if he wants.

01:34:40.667 --> 01:34:42.667
If we go just there,
we'll be in sight.

01:34:43.833 --> 01:34:45.333
Wanna go with 'em, buddy?

01:34:46.792 --> 01:34:49.541
Play with me? What's his name?

01:34:49.542 --> 01:34:51.958
- Harry.
- Come on, Harry.

01:36:47.125 --> 01:36:48.292
What is that?

01:37:00.417 --> 01:37:02.042
<i>Yeah, fuck, yeah.</i>

01:37:25.125 --> 01:37:26.542
<i>Stop it!</i>

01:37:51.958 --> 01:37:56.042
<i>You kept saying sorry
when you were sleeping.</i>

01:37:57.667 --> 01:38:00.125
<i>When I came in, you were saying it.</i>

01:38:02.208 --> 01:38:04.208
<i>What are you sorry about?</i>

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:07.707
<i>I don't remember.</i>

01:38:07.708 --> 01:38:11.375
<i>Do you think you need
to apologise for anything?</i>

01:38:13.917 --> 01:38:15.333
<i>No.</i>

01:38:18.458 --> 01:38:20.374
<i>Do I have to get up?</i>

01:38:20.375 --> 01:38:23.875
<i>No, Grace.
You don't need to do anything.</i>

01:38:24.708 --> 01:38:26.375
<i>I can just stay in bed?</i>

01:38:27.458 --> 01:38:29.458
If that's what you want.

01:38:34.167 --> 01:38:35.583
It's you.

01:38:38.583 --> 01:38:40.000
How are you?

01:38:49.417 --> 01:38:51.333
Everyone misses you.

01:39:33.458 --> 01:39:34.875
Coming in, babe?

01:39:41.417 --> 01:39:42.417
Yeah.

01:40:32.583 --> 01:40:34.583
Fixed it up a little bit.

01:40:35.500 --> 01:40:36.875
Looks nice.

01:40:37.708 --> 01:40:38.792
Yeah.

01:41:53.667 --> 01:41:55.667
You're so beautiful, Grace.

01:42:57.667 --> 01:43:00.207
<i>Oh, Grace. You look so well.</i>

01:43:00.208 --> 01:43:04.041
- It's so great that you're home.
- You look so healthy.

01:43:04.042 --> 01:43:05.542
Thanks.

01:43:06.750 --> 01:43:10.542
Sometimes all we need
is just a little breath, right?

01:43:11.458 --> 01:43:14.874
You know what? You and Jackson
are really lucky to have each other.

01:43:14.875 --> 01:43:16.375
Yeah.

01:43:43.833 --> 01:43:46.332
- Grace, it is so good to see you.
- You too.

01:43:46.333 --> 01:43:49.207
- You look so well.
- Thank you.

01:43:49.208 --> 01:43:52.458
No, but, really, like,
you just look so much better.

01:43:54.375 --> 01:43:57.874
You too.
You look a lot better.

01:43:57.875 --> 01:43:59.749
- All good here?
- Yeah, doing great.

01:43:59.750 --> 01:44:01.916
We're both doing a lot better
than we were.

01:44:01.917 --> 01:44:04.624
- You having a good time?
- The best.

01:44:04.625 --> 01:44:07.624
- That's good.
- And I'm just so grateful to you.

01:44:07.625 --> 01:44:12.124
For taking care of everything.
And painting the house.

01:44:12.125 --> 01:44:14.541
- Taking care of the baby.
- That's sweet.

01:44:14.542 --> 01:44:18.166
Having me fucking committed.
You're just the best.

01:44:18.167 --> 01:44:20.207
- Okay, Grace, come on.
- But I mean it.

01:44:20.208 --> 01:44:22.249
- Please. Don't do this.
- Thank you.

01:44:22.250 --> 01:44:23.832
Don't do what?

01:44:23.833 --> 01:44:26.582
I shot a dog! It was in pain.

01:44:26.583 --> 01:44:29.082
We came to be and we ran amok!

01:44:29.083 --> 01:44:31.750
May we live long and die out.

01:44:34.625 --> 01:44:39.917
Yes. May we live long and die out.

01:44:48.125 --> 01:44:49.791
Grace.

01:44:49.792 --> 01:44:51.083
Pam.

01:45:08.333 --> 01:45:09.583
Grace.

01:45:10.167 --> 01:45:12.542
Leave her be, Jackson.

01:45:21.583 --> 01:45:23.000
Grace!

01:45:27.208 --> 01:45:28.833
<i>Where are you, Grace?</i>

01:45:32.667 --> 01:45:33.667
<i>I'm right here.</i>

01:45:34.250 --> 01:45:36.000
You just can't see me.

01:45:40.708 --> 01:45:42.333
I can't go back.

01:46:04.250 --> 01:46:05.667
I love you.

01:46:06.708 --> 01:46:07.749
I love you.

01:46:07.750 --> 01:46:10.333
<i>Perfect driving tune right here
from John Prine.</i>

01:46:20.250 --> 01:46:21.875
I can try harder.

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.916
<i>She don't like her eggs all runny</i>

01:46:33.917 --> 01:46:36.707
<i>She thinks crossin' her legs is funny</i>

01:46:36.708 --> 01:46:39.999
<i>She looks down her nose at money</i>

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:43.041
<i>She gets it on like the Easter Bunny</i>

01:46:43.042 --> 01:46:46.166
<i>She's my baby, I'm her honey</i>

01:46:46.167 --> 01:46:48.417
<i>I'm never gonna let her go</i>

01:46:50.875 --> 01:46:53.999
<i>He ain't got laid in a month of Sundays</i>

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:57.124
<i>Caught him once
And he was sniffin' my undies</i>

01:46:57.125 --> 01:47:00.541
<i>He ain't too sharp
But he gets things done</i>

01:47:00.542 --> 01:47:03.666
<i>Drinks his beer like it's oxygen</i>

01:47:03.667 --> 01:47:06.874
<i>He's my baby, I'm his honey</i>

01:47:06.875 --> 01:47:09.417
<i>Never gonna let him go</i>

01:47:10.833 --> 01:47:12.916
<i>In spite of ourselves</i>

01:47:12.917 --> 01:47:16.458
<i>We'll end up sittin' on a rainbow</i>

01:47:17.292 --> 01:47:19.416
<i>Against all odds</i>

01:47:19.417 --> 01:47:22.542
<i>Honey, we're the big door prize</i>

01:47:23.583 --> 01:47:29.167
<i>We're gonna spite our noses
Right off of our faces</i>

01:47:29.792 --> 01:47:34.792
<i>There won't be nothin'
But big old hearts dancin' in our eyes</i>

01:48:27.292 --> 01:48:28.708
Enough.

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:01.625
Grace!

01:51:05.333 --> 01:51:06.958
Grace!
