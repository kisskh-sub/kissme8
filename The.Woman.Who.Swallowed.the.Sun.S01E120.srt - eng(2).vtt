00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:01.640
(The late Baek Mi So)

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:02.740
Baek Mi So.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.240
Why is this girl here?

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.780
She was only 20 years old, but why...

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.820
You don't remember, do you?

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:22.760
At the tender age of 16,

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.670
Mi So jumped from the rooftop
of Mingang Distribution...

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.500
four years ago.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.440
Do you remember now?

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.680
Who our Mi So is.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.420
That's ridiculous.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.560
You're insane.

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.030
You've completely lost your mind.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.800
How could she possibly be my daughter?

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.470
Say something that makes sense!

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.300
Then you're saying...

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.540
with my own hands...

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.040
I harmed my own child?

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:33.970
Don't you dare mess with me.

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.800
If you pull a pathetic stunt
like this again,

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.140
I'll kill you with my own two hands.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:57.890
Did you see that?

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.430
(The late Baek Mi So)

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:01.990
That's the mother who gave birth to you.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.700
(The late Baek Mi So)

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.430
She isn't acting like this
because she hates you.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.700
She's just in shock.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.110
What kind of mother in the world...

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.910
would disown her own daughter?

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.990
Mi So.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.960
(The late Baek Mi So)

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.790
You can wait a little longer, can't you?

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.300
You were always such a good girl.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.540
So you can do that, right?

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.720
(Episode 120)

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.250
How could I be her mother?

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.220
(Mingang Distribution)

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.460
What kind of mother
would let her own child commit suicide?

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.230
Lucia. You're pulling out
all the stops now, aren't you?

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.230
You think I'll even bat an eye?

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.930
Whatever tricks you pull,

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:17.800
it won't faze me.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.040
You can't shake me.

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.270
I'll never fall for it!

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.640
(Mingang Distribution)

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:26.180
All I need is my Se Ri.

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:28.650
Only my Se Ri.

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.990
(Mingang Distribution)

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.470
Wait, what happened to the CEO's office?

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.510
Do you have any idea where I've just been?

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.380
The columbarium.

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.120
The columbarium where that girl,
Baek Mi So, is laid to rest.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.460
How did you find out about that place?

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.330
You said it yourself last time,
didn't you?

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.230
You told me to let you know
when I was ready to open Pandora's box.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.900
So this is what you were talking about?

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.470
How long have you known?

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.340
You knew all about it and said nothing
this entire time?

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.210
(Mingang Distribution)

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.850
Answer me!

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.020
Answer me now!

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.450
I said, tell me how long you've known,
you brat!

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.660
You're in on this with her, aren't you?

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.130
The two of you cooked this up together,
didn't you?

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.960
What in the world did she promise you?

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.970
What did you get for keeping quiet
and making a fool of me all this time?

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.340
Who the heck do you people think you are,
toying with me?

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.240
Who do you think you are?

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.040
None of this changes the facts.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.180
The children were switched 20 years ago,

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.150
and your daughter is dead.

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:14.450
Watch your mouth!

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:16.390
Dead?

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.660
Why would my daughter be dead?

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.900
My Se Ri is in the hospital now,
but she's going to wake up soon.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.500
She'll walk out of there
perfectly healthy.

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.140
That woman's daughter died, not mine.

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:38.640
So what are you going to do now?

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:43.720
It looks like Baek Sul Hee told CEO Min
everything about Baek Mi So.

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:46.120
Is that true?

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.150
What a cruel woman.

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.920
She summoned CEO Min
to her child's columbarium.

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:54.730
CEO Min didn't even know
her child was dead,

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:57.700
but Sul Hee told her that her
child's death was no one else's fault...

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.800
but her own.

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:01.700
That's because it's true.

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:05.270
You're the ones
who caused all this heartbreak.

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:06.570
Four years ago,

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:09.340
when that unfortunate incident happened
between the two children,

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.740
if you'd just been honest and admitted it,
and apologized back then,

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:14.110
this all would have been over.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.680
Who was it that covered it up
with lies to the very end?

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.980
We had far too much to lose to apologize.

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:21.620
What did you say?

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:25.390
I said we're in a different league.
Do you think it's easy?

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.960
For the elite to apologize
to the lower class.

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:32.530
Hey, Kim Sun Jae. You really never change.

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:35.470
This is why they say
a leopard can't change its spots.

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:38.000
Who do you think you are
to say that to me?

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:42.010
It's not just Baek Sul Hee bothering me.
You are too, Moon Tae Kyung.

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:45.740
That's why I propose
we end this bad karma right now.

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:49.580
Give Min Doo Sik's slush fund books
to the prosecution and turn yourself in.

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.250
And I've already given you
my answer to that.

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.950
That I'll see this through my way.

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:58.990
As you're set on bringing Min Doo Sik
to justice,

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:02.060
if the aftermath threatens
to completely upend my life,

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:07.030
I'll fight you and Baek Sul Hee
all the way.

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:20.550
Manager Gong,
what's going to happen to our family now?

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.050
What do you mean?

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:27.490
Think about it. That woman
took Father's stake and ran, right?

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:30.320
It got out that Kyung Chae
is Se Ri's birth mother, right?

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:34.890
Se Ri was rescued from the kidnapping,
but she's still unconscious.

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:37.600
Father is in a wheelchair
after his stroke.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.730
How can so much misfortune...

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.870
hit our family all at once,
like a tsunami?

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:45.500
Tell me about it.

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:48.670
I couldn't sleep a wink last night.

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:53.110
I was worried she'd use Father's stake
to officially take the chairman's seat...

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:55.280
and kick our whole family out.

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:58.880
Surely she wouldn't do that.
Not with Se Ri here.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.050
For Se Ri's sake,
she can't possibly do something like that.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:04.160
I'm curious about something.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.690
Manager Gong, last time,
we were talking...

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:07.360
about something similar
and you stopped short.

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:11.960
What's the link between Lucia and Se Ri...

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:13.630
that you keep connecting the two of them?

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:16.500
Connect them? What are you talking about?

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:20.870
Is there some secret story
that I don't know about?

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:24.040
A story? Of course not.
Stop with the pointless speculation.

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:25.440
Good grief...

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:28.910
Unbelievable.

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:38.320
Kyung Chae,
what brings you here at this hour?

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:39.660
Where's Manager Gong?

00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:43.930
Ms. Kyung Chae.

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.360
What...

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:48.430
What's wrong?

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:01.080
Answer my questions
and tell me nothing but the truth.

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:05.450
If you lie about a single thing,
I'll never see you again.

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:07.850
What's going on? You're scaring me.

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:08.950
You said...

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.620
my daughter had stopped breathing...

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:14.790
before she arrived at Eulju Hospital
20 years ago, didn't you?

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.130
In the ambulance,

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:18.860
in your arms,

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:22.870
- that was the end, right?
- Yes, of course.

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:26.900
- Why do you keep bringing it up?
- But...

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:29.440
Apparently, she didn't die then.

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.340
- I heard she was still alive.
- What?

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:36.380
That's ridiculous! Who told you that?

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:38.580
Whoever told you that,
tell them to stop spouting nonsense.

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.590
Your daughter definitely stopped breathing
back then.

00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:43.090
If that weren't true,

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:46.720
- why would I have switched the babies?
- That's what I said too.

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:48.660
That it was all nonsense.

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:50.960
Then why are you still so worked up?

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:54.300
It's just some ridiculous rumor.
You should just ignore it.

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:57.440
I can't ignore it.

00:09:58.600 --> 00:09:59.600
What?

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.610
I said I can't ignore it.

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:06.740
I have to find out for myself.

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:17.690
I'm trying to find a mother and child
from 20 years ago.

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:20.120
They were brought in by ambulance
after she gave birth.

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:22.290
And you don't know the exact date?

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:25.060
September 28, 2006.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.840
A new mother and her baby.
They came here via the Anpyeong highway.

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:33.300
Actually, never mind the mother.

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:36.240
I just need to know
what happened to the baby.

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:39.610
I was told she died for certain.

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:42.480
I need you to check her condition
upon arrival,

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:44.720
whether she was actually dead...

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:47.520
or if she was barely clinging to life.

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:52.990
That's confidential personal information,
so we aren't at liberty to disclose.

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:55.890
Someone's life is at stake!
Who cares about a privacy policy?

00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:58.530
What if you thought your child was dead?

00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:01.430
What if the child whose mother thought
she was dead was actually alive,

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:02.570
and without knowing anything,

00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:04.470
the mother ended up
causing that child’s death?

00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:06.970
Ma'am, I'm not sure
I understand what you're saying.

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:09.670
I said find out now
if my daughter lived or died!

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:15.010
Find out if that woman saved my daughter!
Find out right now!

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:16.810
Ma'am, please calm down.

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:27.560
Father hasn't touched his food again?

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:31.360
- No, he hasn't.
- Gosh, how many days has it been?

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:33.930
At this rate,
we'll be planning his funeral.

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:36.530
Considering everything that's going on
in this family,

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:39.470
I can't say I blame him
for not having an appetite.

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:42.410
To put it lightly, it's a complete mess.

00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:44.910
Anyway, shouldn't we go visit Se Ri?

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:46.740
I'm her brother. I should at least
visit her in the hospital.

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:49.150
You're not her brother,
you're her uncle now.

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:51.820
Is that our relation now?

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:54.950
Whatever our relation is,
she's still lying in that hospital bed.

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:57.190
She's in the ICU,
so it's not like you can visit anyway.

00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:59.720
Besides, I'm sure Kyung Chae
is taking good care of her.

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:01.390
Se Ri is her own flesh and blood.

00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:12.470
(Mingang Distribution)

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:23.570
It's so unfair!

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:26.880
It's so unfair I could die, Mother!

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:38.520
Why did you do this to me?

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:41.060
Why did you let me die feeling so wronged?

00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:44.260
Why on earth would you do that? Why?

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:46.430
You're the one who gave birth to me!

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:53.140
What mother would do that to her daughter?

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:55.270
What kind of mother lets her daughter die?

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.490
Why are you taking Mi So's things?

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:24.060
You should just leave them here.
So you can see them when you miss her.

00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:27.500
I think there's someone who's more curious
to see them than I am.

00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:29.130
Who?

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:30.700
Min Kyung Chae?

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.140
But isn't she denying
that Mi So is even her daughter?

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:38.210
Anyone in her position
would find it hard to accept.

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:40.610
Well, she should have lived
her life right.

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:43.580
Relying on the power
of Mingang Distribution,

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:46.350
sitting in her cushy job
with the world at her feet...

00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:48.220
she was unbearably arrogant, wasn't she?

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:51.390
Everyone else must have looked
like a joke to her.

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:53.320
That's why...

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:57.490
even after driving a 16-year-old
to suicide from the sheer injustice,

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:01.000
she doesn't feel an ounce
of shame or remorse.

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:09.240
Be careful.

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:18.750
Oh my gosh.
Where on earth did you get so hurt?

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:20.520
Manager Gong.

00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:23.020
Se Ri is my daughter, isn't she?

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:25.660
Of course. What a thing to say.

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.860
Why? Did someone say she's not?

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:30.860
Who said that?

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.730
You two are the very picture
of a mother and daughter.

00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:34.130
So, a mother...

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:37.300
is supposed
to protect her own child, right?

00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:39.640
No matter what happens,

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:42.210
a mother's job
is to protect her child, isn't it?

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:43.640
Of course.

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:47.180
Parents exist to protect their children.

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:51.250
If anyone tries to take your child away,
you have to stop them.

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:53.320
You have to stop them
even if it costs you your life.

00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:56.390
Risk my life to stop them?

00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:09.770
(Mingang Distribution)

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.000
These were Mi So's.

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:15.710
I thought you'd be curious.

00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:19.540
We were struggling so much
we couldn't afford a first birthday party,

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:23.210
and we couldn't afford preschool,
so there are no photos from school plays.

00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:26.880
But she was a good student
and won quite a few academic awards.

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:28.690
They're all in here.

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:33.120
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:34.290
This is...

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:36.690
her early acceptance letter
to the international high school.

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:41.270
And this...

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:43.970
is the uniform we had made for her,
but she never got to wear it.

00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:55.180
Are you crazy? What are you doing?

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:56.750
What do you think you're doing?

00:17:57.310 --> 00:17:58.480
What kind of sick stunt is this?

00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:01.950
Why should I have to look
at your dead daughter's things?

00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:04.490
Why are you making a scene over this junk?

00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:07.320
If they're so precious,
you can stare at them all you want.

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:09.760
They're nothing but trash to me.

00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:12.130
"Trash?"

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:15.730
How can you call
your own child's mementos trash?

00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:16.900
What child?

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:19.040
Who on earth are you calling my child?

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.270
My daughter is Se Ri.

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:24.210
No matter how much you insist,
that fact won't change.

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.610
You must have lost your mind
after your daughter's death.

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:28.580
Look.

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:30.310
Snap out of it.

00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:33.020
Do you think that's going
to bring her back to life?

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:35.820
If you're going to lose your mind,
at least have some class.

00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:38.490
You can't just go around claiming
someone else's daughter is yours.

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:41.120
You think that'll make her your daughter?

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:43.230
Just because your own daughter is dead,

00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:46.430
you're just trying to take Se Ri from me.

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:48.800
So just stop it.

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:52.470
Keep this up, and I won't be so nice.

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:10.950
Who's Mi So?

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:13.790
Who is she?

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:16.830
I don't know her.

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:18.960
I don't need some kid like that.

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:22.130
All I need is my Se Ri.

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:24.870
Once my Se Ri wakes up,

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.840
everything will be fine.
There won't be any problem at all.

00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:30.310
No matter what anyone says.

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:36.580
Se Ri is my daughter.
What can she do about it?

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:40.550
Some stupid DNA test?

00:19:41.290 --> 00:19:42.590
What a joke.

00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:44.390
Like that's such a big deal.

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:47.590
The whole world knows
that Se Ri is my daughter.

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:49.430
Who does she think she is?

00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:55.270
What are you doing out here?

00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:57.130
Perfect timing, Lawyer Kim.

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:01.310
I think Lucia is completely lost her mind.

00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:02.870
Excuse me?

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:06.010
Can you believe it? She tried to give me
mementos from some girl named Mi So.

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:09.810
Why on earth would I take the things
of someone else's dead child...

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:11.780
when my own daughter
is clearly still alive?

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:14.550
We need to act fast.

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:16.950
If we don't get her out of the company,
there will be hell to pay.

00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:21.120
She's already lost it and can't tell
her child from a stranger's.

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:22.430
We can't just let that slide, can we?

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:27.760
That's why you have to help me.

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:30.600
We have to force that woman out.

00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:35.170
To protect the company and Se Ri.

00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:37.980
Okay?

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:47.250
What the heck did you do?

00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:50.090
What did you do to make
CEO Min react like that?

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:52.890
I gave her Mi So's things.

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:54.830
She's the birth mother.
She deserves to know.

00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:56.690
Are you out of your mind?

00:20:57.430 --> 00:21:00.260
Would you want to face a child
who died because of you?

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.070
I'm not trying to make her feel good.

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:04.600
I'm not trying
to torment Min Kyung Chae, either.

00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:07.900
I did that
hoping she would accept the truth,

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:10.270
atone for her past,
and beg for forgiveness.

00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:13.510
Because the wrongs of the past
must be made right.

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:15.250
My Mi So...

00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:20.250
She was an innocent victim
in that assault case four years ago.

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:25.120
But you people twisted the truth
with your money, power, and connections!

00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:29.360
I'm here to set things right again.

00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:33.230
And to do that,
she has to face reality first.

00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:36.900
Can you just get the heck out of here,
will you?

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:40.940
The past is in the past.
Why are you dredging it all up now?

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:42.040
No!

00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:45.310
I'm going to make this right,
starting now.

00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:48.780
All the filthy lies
you smeared my Mi So's name with!

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:51.980
Feeding her to the media for a witch hunt!

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:55.450
I'm going to clear her name.

00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:01.430
- Do we really have to go this far?
- The shaman said it himself.

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:02.830
Our house is east, which is bad,

00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:04.760
and Chairman Min's is in the west,
so that's out too.

00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:07.430
He said a spot in the south, by the water,
is the perfect place.

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:09.030
This is a Korean spa.
It's full of heat, not water.

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:12.370
No, they have baths with plenty of water.
It has water, too.

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:15.370
Wait a minute. You know,
the more I think on it, the angrier I get.

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:17.470
How can one talisman cost a whole grand?

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:19.580
They say the more expensive it is,
the more potent it is.

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:22.050
How can you be so cheap
about something like this?

00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:25.280
All the good energy from that money
is getting stored up in this.

00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:28.820
Money is the best thing in the world.
Nothing shows devotion like hard cash.

00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:31.090
- Money, money, money!
- Money, money, money, money, money!

00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:33.290
- Money, money, money!
- Mom. Dad.

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:34.960
- You're here.
- You made it.

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:39.100
Why did you make me come all this way?
You think this will change anything?

00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:41.570
Hey! Take it back now! Seriously!

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:43.970
You shouldn't say things
that could jinx us.

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:46.040
Ptooey, like this?

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:50.040
Yes, good girl. Now, make sure
to keep this with you at all times.

00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:53.780
Don't ever take it off.
And put one in Ji Seop's underwear.

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:56.010
That cost a pretty penny, you know.

00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:57.180
Money, money, money.

00:22:57.250 --> 00:22:58.880
Money is intention,
and intention is money.

00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:00.650
All right. I'll keep it with me.

00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:05.990
But is this supposed to
get rid of bad luck?

00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:08.830
Hey, there you go again.
I told you not to say things that jinx it!

00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:11.860
She's right. Ji Seop's family
isn't functional right now, is it?

00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:15.330
It's one disaster after another there.
You must do this to avoid bad luck.

00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:19.000
Anyway, let's just head inside. Come on.

00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:20.500
Let's go in.

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:21.540
(Women's Bath Entrance)

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:22.810
Oh my, are you crazy?

00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:25.040
- Are you crazy? Where are you going?
- You're insane!

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:26.910
This is the women's bathhouse!

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:29.580
- Oh my!
- He's really lost it!

00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:31.580
Honestly, he's ridiculous.

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:37.520
You're coming with me.

00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:39.860
And where are you trying to drag me now?

00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:42.990
We're going to every TV station
and newspaper office.

00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:45.500
We should visit all those places
that twisted the stories...

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:49.970
of my Mi So's assault and published
trash stories four years ago.

00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:51.740
We're going to set the record straight!

00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:53.600
And why would I go there with you?

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:57.410
Because she's your daughter.
Will you pretend this doesn't concern you?

00:23:57.540 --> 00:24:00.940
- What kind of mother would do that?
- Who are you calling my daughter?

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:03.150
I told you, she's not my daughter!

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:05.220
My daughter's name is Se Ri.

00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:08.450
Why do you keep forcing
your dead daughter on me?

00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:10.920
Are you that desperate
to pawn her off on me?

00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:13.190
Then again,

00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:16.260
you couldn't protect her child,
so you must feel like a criminal.

00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:19.330
But don't you dare push
that guilt onto me.

00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:22.530
By insisting your dead daughter is mine,

00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:25.200
are you trying to steal my daughter
who's still alive?

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:31.580
You think I'd let you?

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:34.480
Lose my daughter to someone like you?

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:36.280
I'll never let you take her.

00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:38.650
Because Mi So is your daughter.

00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:42.490
The daughter you destroyed!

00:24:42.790 --> 00:24:45.620
No! She is not my daughter!

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:52.360
Come with me.

00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:54.200
- Let go!
- Come!

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:55.500
What do you think you're doing?

00:24:58.370 --> 00:25:00.500
- Let go of me!
- I said, come with me!

00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:03.140
- Where are you taking me?
- Come with me.

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:06.310
Hurry up!

00:25:18.290 --> 00:25:19.290
Come here!

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:22.560
Get over here!

00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:25.700
- Let go of me!
- Come on!

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:32.200
Take a good, hard look at what happened
to your daughter right here!

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:33.800
What daughter?

00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:38.010
I said, take a good look at
what you did back then!

00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:41.310
Come here!

00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:48.550
See what our Mi So must have felt
when she jumped from this very spot.

00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:49.620
Let go of me!

00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:52.860
- Let go of me!
- Lucia!

00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:06.400
You can't force her like this.
It won't work.

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:10.610
If she can't even accept her own daughter,
how can she right the wrongs of the past?

00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:15.480
She doesn't feel
the least bit sorry for Mi So.

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:19.980
Admitting to Mi So would mean
exposing her own shameful past.

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:22.120
That's not going to be easy for her.

00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:24.350
Just an "I'm sorry"...

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:27.990
That's all it would take.

00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:31.060
It's not going to happen today.

00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:34.360
Let's just go home for now.
You look terribly pale.

00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:51.980
If my Se Ri wakes up...

00:26:53.650 --> 00:26:55.620
and finds out that woman
is her birth mother...

00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:00.090
And what if she leaves me?

00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:05.730
No! Absolutely not!

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:10.600
The second Se Ri wakes up,
that woman will spill everything.

00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:14.070
That's why she's always
hanging around the hospital...

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:16.770
and clinging to Se Ri's side.

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:22.550
I need to get rid of that woman.

00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:25.720
I have to protect my daughter.

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:29.650
A mother can't let her child
be taken away.

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:33.420
That's not being a mother.

00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:42.300
Wait here for a second.

00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:06.660
