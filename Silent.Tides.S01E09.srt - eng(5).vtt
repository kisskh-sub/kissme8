You're Dr. Ke Lin, I presume?

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:54.759
Yes, that's me. May I ask who you are?

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.060
I'm Sawa Eisaku.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.340
Excuse me

for taking up your time, Dr. Ke.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.710
I have a few questions I'd like to ask.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.400
May I ask what this is regarding?

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.740
Dr. Ke, you're a renowned doctor
in Macau

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.000
and the Director of the Medical Department
at Kiang Wu Hospital.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.850
Why

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.670
would the hospital assign you
to collect corpses?

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.620
That seems beneath your station.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.440
I was on duty today

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.540
and simply took care of it
while I was at it.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:33.800
Simply took care of it?

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.860
If I recall correctly,

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.770
it should take less than an hour

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.770
from the hospital to this cemetery.

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.220
Did something unexpected happen, Dr. Ke?

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.540
Why did it take over two hours?

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.110
This afternoon, the hospital received
a request from Tongshan Hall.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.620
Multiple bodies of plague victims

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.340
were found in the shantytown area.

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.430
The charity corpse-collection team

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.500
can retrieve the bodies,

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.440
but they aren't equipped to carry
out epidemic prevention or disinfection.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.150
To stop the plague from spreading,

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.690
the hospital had to dispatch
an epidemic control officer.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:11.650
As it happened,

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.470
we also had bodies here that needed
transferring to the cemetery.

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:15.430
Since I was already handling
the transfer,

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.370
I took the opportunity to go over

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.000
and oversee the disinfection
and containment procedures—

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.800
that's what took the extra time.

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:23.720
Is that so?

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:26.790
If you require further details,

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.120
these are the handover documents
from Tongshan Hall.

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.210
They contain full records
of the recovery operation

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.010
and the preventive disinfection
measures taken.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.160
Great. Thank you.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.800
Now, would you open

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.800
the back of the vehicle for inspection?

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.310
The remains inside are still
highly contagious.

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.570
Are you certain you wish to examine them?

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.000
If Dr. Ke has no concerns,

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.820
I can follow your lead.

Let's go.

Under epidemic prevention protocols,

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:48.040
If we can't secure food supplies

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:49.900
and end this famine,

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:53.060
we won't make it
past this life-and-death crisis.

00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:57.340
Esteemed colleagues from the business
communities of Hong Kong and Macau,

00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:57.490
[Hong Kong and Macao Business Community
New Year's Eve Gathering]

00:12:57.490 --> 00:12:59.200
whether Macau can save itself

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:03.350
will depend on all of us
pooling our wisdom and strength.

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:04.960
Does anyone

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:07.450
have any ideas?

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:23.490
Mr. Fu,

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:25.820
Mr. Cui,

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:27.540
you two

00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:30.180
are among Macau's top business leaders.

00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:31.900
What are your thoughts?

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:33.440
If it's a matter of money,

00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:34.800
I would

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:36.950
sell everything I own

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.380
without hesitation.

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.520
I would do the same without question.

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:41.450
The sad truth is,

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:44.270
even with money,
there's simply no food to be had.

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:56.300
Excuse me,

00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:57.210
[Hong Kong and Macao Business Community
New Year's Eve Gathering]

00:13:57.210 --> 00:13:58.330
is Mr. He Xian

00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:00.490
of Huilong Bank here?

00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:06.950
Mr. Ma,

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:10.100
why are you looking for that traitor?

00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:12.430
Traitor?

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:30.990
Are you sure this is the place?

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:32.410
This is definitely

00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:34.340
the address from the sign-in book.

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:39.660
Watch your step.

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:45.670
Father, Xian is back.

00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:48.990
We're here. This is He Xian's family.

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:56.710
Alright, you go ahead and talk.

00:14:57.090 --> 00:14:58.070
Mr. He.

00:14:58.100 --> 00:14:59.020
-Qiwen.
-Mr. He.

00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:00.080
-Mr. Lyu.
-Mrs. He.

Mr. Ou.

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:04.700
What brings you all here?

00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:15.730
I'm home, Dr. Ke.

00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:20.040
Get some rest.

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:24.970
Lyu.

00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:25.760
Xian.

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:26.570
-Mr. He.
-What brings you here?

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:27.300
Xian,

00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:29.440
I'm Ma Wanqi.

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:36.510
Back at the pier,

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:40.020
I had no idea it was you, Xian,

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:42.800
and I certainly never imagined
my business

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:45.530
would bring such hardship
to you and your family.

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:47.280
Please accept my deepest apologies, Xian.

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:48.190
It's alright.

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:50.080
I only did what was right.

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:52.920
As long as that shipment
arrived safely,

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:54.390
it was all worth it.

00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:56.360
Xian,

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:59.400
it was our fault
for mistaking a good man for bad.

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:00.530
I can't bring myself

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:02.760
to apologize further.

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:04.710
This is

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:06.830
the short-term loan
I took out from Huilong Bank back then,

00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:08.120
now repaid in full,

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:09.710
principal plus interest.

00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:10.770
And this is from me.

00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:21.680
Xian, when we just arrived,

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:23.760
we met your father, your wife,
and your children—

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:25.970
all waiting for you
for the New Year's reunion dinner.

00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:26.900
They've been hungry for so long.

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:28.300
We happened to bring
a few New Year's gifts.

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:29.160
Consider this your New Year's Eve feast.

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:30.560
Please, you all must eat.

00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:48.210
Xian,

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:49.570
I know how much

00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:51.420
you've suffered these past days,

00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:53.760
and how much pain you must
be holding inside.

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:55.310
But the truth has come out now,

00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:56.710
and all that is behind us.

00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:00.250
What good is this food

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:02.680
if only our family

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:05.180
gets to eat?

00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:18.970
Let him cry.

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:20.900
Let him cry it out—

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:24.359
because he isn't crying for himself.

00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:25.859
Tonight,

00:17:25.859 --> 00:17:27.020
to save a child,

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:28.569
we went to a place—

00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:29.730
a living hell

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:31.720
we never wish to set foot in again.

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:32.860
What place?

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:36.380
Taipa Cemetery.

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:38.850
The mass grave.

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:12.030
So, no one's willing to stay?

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:22.680
Hey.

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:24.570
What's wrong?

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:28.030
The Consulate received a cable from MI6.

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:31.530
They hope to recruit 1 or 2 officers

00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:32.790
from those who escaped Hong Kong

00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:33.880
to voluntarily stay behind

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:37.210
and establish a British Military
Service Station in Macau.

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:40.370
A British Military
Service Station in Macau?

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:42.140
What is it that for?

00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:42.900
First,

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:43.660
if any more

00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:45.920
British personnel escape from Hong Kong,

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:47.380
there'll be someone
to receive them here.

00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:47.950
Second,

00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:49.820
using Macau's status as a neutral port,

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:51.400
it would serve as an outpost
intelligence station to secretly

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:55.600
gather information on Japanese forces
in Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macau.

00:18:56.290 --> 00:18:57.820
So, to stay behind as spies?

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:00.010
Yes.

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:07.990
No wonder everyone went quiet.

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:11.320
Has MI6 lost their minds?

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:12.820
All of them are

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:14.520
on the Japanese wanted list.

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:16.680
What's the point of staying behind?

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:17.680
A death wish?

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:19.400
But right now, the Allies

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:22.600
have zero presence
across Hong Kong and Macau.

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:24.600
Someone has to gather intelligence,

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.650
prepare for a future counteroffensive.

00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:27.800
Counteroffensive?

00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:30.670
Just staying alive
is hard enough as it is.

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:32.460
I've told you so many times—

00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:35.150
people here don't wrap
their turbans this way.

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:49.690
Thank you.

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:57.340
Everyone, please be careful.

00:19:57.340 --> 00:19:58.600
Watch your step.

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:23.720
Thank you.

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:30.430
Wait.

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:36.670
I know this is important to you,

00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:38.150
so I redeemed it.

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:52.450
On the New Year's Day, no less,

00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:53.420
and I still have to go back

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:55.680
and clear any trace of you staying there.

00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:57.990
Getting mixed up with you people

00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:00.680
is just my luck.

00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:48.750
Who is it?

00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:13.510
What happened?

00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:14.340
Did the evacuation fail?

00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:15.300
Are you alright?

00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:16.410
I'm fine.

00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:24.400
Where are the others?

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:25.340
They left.

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:28.160
Then why didn't you go?

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:30.490
I'm not leaving.

00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:35.130
Why not?

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.320
I've decided.

00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:40.750
I'm staying in Macau

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:45.900
to establish a BMSSM.

00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:48.340
What?

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:53.250
What's in your hand?

00:22:58.510 --> 00:22:59.010
Trash.

00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:04.230
You don't have a fever.

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:08.320
Why are you talking nonsense like that?

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:10.410
Don't worry, I know what I'm doing.

00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:14.980
Spying under the noses of the Japanese,

00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:16.750
gathering intelligence.

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:18.180
You know how to do all that?

00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:18.750
Not yet,

00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:20.350
but I can learn.

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:23.320
A society lady like you—
who are you going to learn from?

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:24.580
Who'll teach you?

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:29.240
Do you think the spies
and the Japanese in Macau

00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:31.510
are playing house with you?

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:34.190
This is a line of work
that gets you killed.

00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:37.250
Lyons ran off faster than a rabbit,

00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:39.590
and you want to stay and show off?

00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:41.850
But I have my advantages.

00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:44.320
First, I'm just a military dependent—

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:45.980
I won't be on any wanted lists,

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:48.360
the Japanese won't notice me.

00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:51.880
Second, before I got married,
I worked at the telegraph office.

00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:53.470
I know how to operate a telegraph.

00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:55.270
Do you have a telegraph machine?

00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:58.320
Even if one fell from the sky for you,

00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:00.180
what intelligence would you gather?

00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:01.440
Where would you get it?

00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:03.160
And after you get it,
who would you send it to?

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:03.940
Who's your contact?

00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:06.140
Did MI6 give you communication codes?

00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:09.450
I… I haven't thought about that yet.

00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:10.310
You haven't thought about it,

00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:11.230
and you've already appointed yourself

00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:13.160
a female spy of the British Empire?

00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:15.860
I know—

00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:19.030
you're doing this to wait for William,
aren't you?

00:24:19.030 --> 00:24:20.760
Let me tell you, stop dreaming.

00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:23.180
The Japanese aren't as simple
as you think.

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:25.030
Do you really think it's easy
to escape from a POW camp?

00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:26.880
This has nothing to do with him.

00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:28.940
When I decided to stay in Macau,

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:30.800
I wasn't even thinking about him.

00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:32.740
Then what were you thinking about?

[Following the Fall of Hong Kong,

00:24:59.490 --> 00:24:59.950
Hello.

00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:01.840

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:02.130

[cultural progressives,

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:14.130
Comrade Zhengping,
thank you for your hard work.

Here,

00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:17.920
you've worked hard, comrade.

[Over the course of 6 months,

00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:20.120
Thank you.

Thank you. Thank you so much.

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:31.930
You've worked hard.

00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:43.950
Thank you for your hard work.

00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:44.750
Thank you for your hard work, comrade.

00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:46.350
Thank you for your hard work.

00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:57.820
Macau's predicament

00:25:57.970 --> 00:25:59.290
goes beyond the surface-level blockade—

00:25:59.290 --> 00:26:00.920
what we really need to understand

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:02.250
is the reason behind it.

00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:03.910
The reason behind it?

00:26:04.050 --> 00:26:05.120
Occupying Macau by force

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:07.250
would be effortless for the Japanese.

00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:09.840
So why go to all this trouble,

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:11.290
taking such a roundabout approach

00:26:11.290 --> 00:26:13.180
with this so-called "cooperation plan"?

00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:14.450
What is

00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:16.530
their real objective?

00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:17.750
I see it now—

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:20.260
they're after supplies.

00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:22.490
Before Hong Kong fell,

00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:24.080
the Japanese had already set up

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:25.380
many trading companies in Hong Kong

00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:27.530
disguised as British
or Chinese enterprises,

00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:27.990
aiming

00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:29.120
to buy up China's

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:30.470
strategic specialties

00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:32.750
and large quantities
of Anglo-American industrial goods.

00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:34.610
But now that Hong Kong has fallen,

00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:37.140
the mainland will naturally
stop shipping those specialties here,

00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:39.190
and Britain and the U.S. have
declared war on them—

00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:41.320
the supply channel for strategic materials
has been cut off.

00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:42.180
So the Japanese

00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:44.820
must find a new trade route.

00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:49.020
That's why they aren't openly
occupying Macau—

00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:49.880
in order to keep it

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:51.970
as an international free port
serving the entire region

00:26:51.970 --> 00:26:53.750
between China and Southeast Asia.

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:56.380
That way,
they can keep securing
China's strategic resources

00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:58.400
and British and American industrial goods.

00:26:58.400 --> 00:26:58.850
Mr. He,

00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:01.050
you're an expert in finance.

00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:04.250
Looking at it from the perspective
of wartime finance,

00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:06.920
I believe you can draw another conclusion.

00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:11.530
I get it now.

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:13.500
Please, explain it to us.

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:16.710
Importing strategic materials
requires foreign currency.

00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:18.510
Since the Pacific War broke out,

00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:20.340
Hong Kong's role
as an international financial hub

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:21.620
has become nominal.

00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:23.860
Japan wants to find
a new international financial foothold,

00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:25.010
and that place can only be—

00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:25.860
and

00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:27.400
will only be—Macau.

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:31.360
Now that we've figured out
the scheme behind all this.

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:32.950
But how can we help Macau

00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:34.620
survive this crisis?

00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:46.700
Do you know how much grain
I have on hand right now?

00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:49.010
Ten million kilograms!

00:27:49.210 --> 00:27:52.010
And this entire deal—
I'm putting it in your hands.

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:53.010
Dr. Ke,

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:54.420
Mr. Ma,

00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:56.590
I've made up my mind—

00:27:57.170 --> 00:27:58.580
I'm going to buy

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:01.100
back the food supplies for Macau.

00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:15.750
Brother Xian, you said before
that this kind of deal

00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:16.820
couldn't be done—

00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:18.900
what changed your mind?

00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:33.270
He Xian, what do you mean by this?

00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:34.990
Showing up on the first day
of the New Year with a pile of pig slop—

00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:36.360
are you looking for trouble?

00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:37.120
Huh?

00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:38.450
Rong.

00:28:39.550 --> 00:28:40.440
Captain Huang,

00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:42.460
this "pig slop" Rong mentioned

00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:45.490
was actually my family's
New Year's Eve dinner last night.

00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:46.970
If I hadn't been lucky enough

00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:48.370
to run into a few friends,

00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:51.230
who knows what would've
become of that meal.

00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:54.120
So, Captain Huang,

00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:57.690
do you still need to ask
why I changed my mind?

00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:05.120
See?

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:08.100
No one in this world says no to money.

00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:10.860
Captain Huang,

00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:12.420
since you're handing the business to me,

00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:14.160
it means you recognize me.

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:15.940
But friendship is one thing;

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:17.120
business is another.

00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:18.660
If we're going to cooperate,

00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:20.360
I still need you to be straight

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:22.450
with me about your bottom line.

00:29:24.730 --> 00:29:25.690
Fair enough.

00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:28.030
Brother Xian, you speak frankly,

00:29:28.030 --> 00:29:29.830
so I won't hide anything either.

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:31.530
The rice from Zhongshan

00:29:31.530 --> 00:29:32.940
costs 60 avos per kilogram—

00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:34.230
covering purchase, storage,

00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:36.030
loss, and transport.

00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:37.690
Ten million kilograms total,

00:29:37.690 --> 00:29:39.420
total cost, 6 million patacas.

00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:41.970
And the selling price?

00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:44.950
Four patacas per kilogram—

00:29:45.290 --> 00:29:46.550
is that unreasonable?

00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:48.750
With a 6 million investment,

00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:50.490
you're planning to sell
for 40 million patacas.

00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:52.620
Captain Huang, your appetite is huge.

00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:55.020
But in Macau right now,

00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:57.120
whoever has grain calls the shots.

00:29:57.210 --> 00:29:58.340
I'll look for buyers

00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:00.120
at 4 patacas per kilogram.

00:30:01.530 --> 00:30:02.730
I have one condition:

00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:06.400
6 million patacas in cash

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:08.330
at the time the contract is signed.

00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:09.840
The remaining 34 million patacas

00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:10.900
must be paid

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:13.400
with Banco Nacional Ultramarino
post-dated checks,

00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:15.030
to be cashed upon delivery.

00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:17.260
Captain Huang,

00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:18.420
who in Macau right now

00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:20.680
can come up with 40 million patacas
in one go?

00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:22.810
Buyers like that won't be easy to find.

00:30:23.250 --> 00:30:24.290
If one isn't enough,

00:30:24.290 --> 00:30:25.970
we'll find several.

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:28.640
I believe you can manage it.

00:30:33.050 --> 00:30:33.580
Alright,

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:35.920
I'll think of a way

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:37.120
to handle the buyers.

00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:43.180
There's one more thing:

00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:44.600
this deal

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:45.580
can only go through

00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:48.470
after 6 p.m. on the 18th.

00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:51.880
That's the final deadline
the Imperial Army

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:53.190
gave the Portuguese.

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:55.360
Only once the Portuguese
sign the agreement

00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:57.420
will the Japanese lift the blockade.

00:30:57.490 --> 00:30:58.380
Until then,

00:30:58.380 --> 00:30:59.470
on Imperial Army orders,

00:30:59.470 --> 00:31:01.880
not a single grain of rice
can enter Macau.

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:03.190
So that's it.

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:05.540
Captain Huang,

00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:07.850
why didn't you say so earlier?

00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:10.110
You got my hopes up for nothing.

00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:11.710
This deal…

00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:13.010
can't be done.

00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:16.360
Why not again?

00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:18.840
Why has the price of grain
in Macau skyrocketed?

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:22.100
It is entirely because the Japanese
have blockaded Macau.

00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:23.940
The moment that blockade is lifted,

00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:25.530
grain from all over will flood

00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:27.180
into Macau like crazy.

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:28.580
By then,

00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:30.310
forget 4 patacas per kilogram—

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:32.460
you'll be lucky not to lose money.

00:31:34.050 --> 00:31:35.450
I hadn't thought of that.

00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:38.440
Then what should we do?

00:31:40.250 --> 00:31:41.580
There's no other way.

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:42.580
It's off.

00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:49.160
Wait—

00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:51.190
what if

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:52.620
we ship the rice

00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:53.640
from Zhongshan here

00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:54.690
before they sign?

00:31:56.030 --> 00:31:57.600
Didn't you just say

00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:58.860
the Japanese won't allow

00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:01.050
any grain into Macau
before the agreement is signed?

00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:02.510
I said ship it here—

00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:03.790
not into Macau.

00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:07.170
Keep the grain barges anchored
near the piers.

00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:09.000
The moment the Japanese sign,

00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:11.620
I'll be the first to know,

00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:12.730
and I'll notify you.

00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:14.490
You bring the boats in and unload.

00:32:14.490 --> 00:32:15.190
That way,

00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:17.390
we don't violate Imperial Army orders.

00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:19.530
That's brilliant.

00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:20.780
Alright,

00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:22.160
let's go

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:23.300
with your plan.

00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:24.730
Then we

00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:26.180
have an agreement.

00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:28.620
Yes, we do.

00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:38.640
I've already taken stock
of all of Hengfengyu's assets—

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:40.270
including property and ancestral holdings—

00:32:40.270 --> 00:32:42.040
and it only adds up to 3 million patacas.

00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:43.640
Looking across all of Macau,

00:32:43.710 --> 00:32:45.270
only the two of you

00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:47.720
can come up with such a vast sum.

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:50.580
Don't worry about the post-dated checks.

00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:51.550
The contract states

00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:53.820
they can only be cashed
after the goods are delivered.

00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:54.710
Since this contract

00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:56.340
will never actually be executed,

00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:57.880
no matter
whether the plan succeeds or fails,

00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:00.140
Huang Gongjie won't be able
to cash them.

00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:03.720
The real risk lies in
that 6 million patacas in cash.

00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:04.680
Exactly.

00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:07.600
The risks in this matter
are truly enormous.

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:09.100
If you both need time to consider…

00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:09.790
No need.

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:11.880
We'll sign this contract.

00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:23.980
Mr. Huang,

00:33:24.730 --> 00:33:28.180
there's something I'm not sure
I should say or not.

00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:28.710
Go ahead.

00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:32.970
Mr. Huang,

00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:36.180
the whole of Macau is starving,
skin and bones.

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:37.580
With the grain in our own hands,

00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:39.100
why worry
about not being able to sell it?

00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:41.140
Why drag that He Xian into it

00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:43.730
and let him take a cut in the middle?

00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:45.820
You don't get it?

00:33:46.770 --> 00:33:47.600
Right now

00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:49.840
we've got the label of "big traitors"
hanging over our heads.

00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:52.400
Who'd want to do business
with us directly?

00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:56.290
Besides,

00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:57.580
even if the deal goes through,

00:33:57.580 --> 00:34:00.400
we still have to hand over
a cut to the Imperial Army.

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:01.230
If they find out

00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:03.510
we're selling rice
at 4 patacas a kilogram,

00:34:03.510 --> 00:34:05.640
how much would be left
for us to pocket?

00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:07.820
That's why we need

00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:09.699
a trusted middleman—

00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:12.170
someone who can handle the buyers

00:34:12.170 --> 00:34:14.110
and keep the Imperial Army in the dark.

00:34:14.110 --> 00:34:16.110
And if something goes wrong one day,

00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:17.909
it's He Xian who handled it—

00:34:18.739 --> 00:34:20.340
what's that got to do with us?

00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:22.969
Mr. Huang, you are truly a leader.

00:34:22.969 --> 00:34:24.900
You see further than the rest of us.

00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:27.400
This deal really does have
to go through him.

00:34:27.949 --> 00:34:28.400
No,

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:29.670
I… that's not what I meant.

00:34:29.670 --> 00:34:30.360
What I'm saying is,

00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:32.409
I've got a bad feeling about him.

00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:33.670
Mr. Huang,

00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:35.110

I was just about to catch
that foreign woman,

00:34:38.070 --> 00:34:41.360
and he chose that exact moment
to spill the grain and ruin everything.

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:42.620
What does that tell us?

00:34:42.989 --> 00:34:44.120
He did it on purpose.

00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:46.820
I don't think so.

00:34:47.969 --> 00:34:48.840
You've been to his place,

00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:50.370
and you know his situation.

00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:52.320
Who would spill lifesaving grain

00:34:53.469 --> 00:34:54.780
for some unrelated foreigner?

00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:55.380
Mr. Huang,

00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:58.820
believe me or not, this has to be said—

00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:01.560

the risks of this matter

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:48.470
are truly immense.

00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:51.090
The slightest mishap
could mean ruin for the entire gang.

00:39:51.090 --> 00:39:54.420
As the leader,
how could I answer to our ancestors,

00:39:54.530 --> 00:39:57.440
or to the families of all our brothers?

00:40:01.570 --> 00:40:02.170
Zixia,

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:04.300
this is a matter for the whole gang.

00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:05.320
Don't be rash.

00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:06.970
Uncle,

00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:10.130
what I'm about to say
isn't a matter for the gang—

00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:12.670
it's personal.

00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:23.060
In the past, I was blind.

00:40:23.330 --> 00:40:24.610
I failed to recognize a man of honor

00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:26.700
and misunderstood Xian time and again.

00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:29.300
Only today have I understood
your true virtue and righteousness.

00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:30.510
I'm deeply

00:40:31.590 --> 00:40:32.570
ashamed.

00:40:33.490 --> 00:40:35.280
So before our ancestors

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:37.380
and every elder and brother of the gang,

00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:39.440
I want to offer Xian tea as an apology.

00:40:46.610 --> 00:40:47.410
Master Huang,

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:48.530
you mustn't.

00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:49.490
Please, get up.

00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:50.670
Mr. He,

00:40:51.890 --> 00:40:54.340
in the past, the Tai Ho Brotherhood
wronged you.

00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:55.900
It's only right for Zixia

00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:57.530
to apologize.

00:40:58.740 --> 00:40:59.360
Xian,

00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:01.620
Master Huang is sincere.

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:03.420
No need to stand on ceremony.

00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:05.380
If you don't drink that apology tea,

00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:06.970
given his martial skill,

00:41:06.970 --> 00:41:09.030
not even nine bulls could pull him up.

00:41:23.610 --> 00:41:24.410
Master Huang,

00:41:24.410 --> 00:41:25.300
please get up.

00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:29.330
Thank you, Xian.

00:41:32.970 --> 00:41:33.800
Uncle,

00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:35.900
now I'll speak

00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:37.510
of gang business.

00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:40.450
The two gentlemen made it
very clear earlier—

00:41:40.450 --> 00:41:43.050
our Tai Ho Brotherhood has always
walked the jianghu by righteousness.

00:41:43.050 --> 00:41:44.530
If we all shrink back

00:41:44.530 --> 00:41:45.260
at a time like this,

00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:48.920
how can we possibly live up
to the phrase "Loyalty lasts forever"?

00:41:53.590 --> 00:41:54.470
Uncle,

00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:58.130
I, Huang Zixia, the master
of the Haifeng Hall,

00:41:58.130 --> 00:41:59.590
am willing to lead all my hall's brothers

00:41:59.590 --> 00:42:01.940
in following Xian and Mr. Ma.

00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:02.970
We will go through fire and water

00:42:02.970 --> 00:42:04.170
without hesitation.

00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:05.320
Leader, I respectfully

00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:07.850
ask your approval
for our voluntary request.

00:42:13.590 --> 00:42:14.170
Leader,

00:42:16.010 --> 00:42:17.030
all brothers—

00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:18.940
the famine in Macau

00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:20.170
was forced upon its people
by Huang Gongjie,

00:42:20.170 --> 00:42:23.130
helping the Japanese.

00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:24.820
Yet in the jianghu,

00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:26.720
everyone knows Huang Gongjie

00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:29.180
was once a traitor
of our Tai Ho Brotherhood.

00:42:29.590 --> 00:42:32.230
If we stand by

00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:34.840
and do nothing
while this traitor commits evil,

00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:37.970
how will the jianghu
see our Tai Ho Brotherhood?

00:42:41.130 --> 00:42:41.880
Leader,

00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:44.340
all brothers of my Haiyun Hall

00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:45.990
are willing to transport grain for Macau,

00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:48.710
to atone for the sins
of our gang's traitor.

00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:50.140
Leader, we await

00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:51.300
your permission.

00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:52.050
Leader,

00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:55.130
our hall's brothers
are also willing to join.

00:42:55.130 --> 00:42:56.760
We're willing!
