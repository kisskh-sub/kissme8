[The Vendetta of An]

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.000
Wuyang Army is already
guarding the city outside.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.600
Why are you still here to check
the city's defense, General?

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.850
I've followed His Majesty
to the south for a while now.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.640
Sometimes,

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.100
I still miss the north.

[Episode 8]

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.700
Have another look.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.070
I don't want it anymore.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.150
Let's go.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:08.950
Move quickly!

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:12.396
Have a persimmon.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.690
Take a look.

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.656
Don't miss out on this deal!

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.900
Local persimmons!

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:19.566
Pears!

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.590
Three wen for a jin.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:21.846
Mister, do you want some pears?

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:22.677
They are sweet.

00:02:22.701 --> 00:02:25.886
[Wang Pu, Huben Member]

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:26.690
Miss,

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.770
you are pretty and have smooth skin.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.530
I'm sure the pear is sweet.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:31.750
Absolutely.

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.810
I only have one wen on me.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.900
Your mouth is sweeter than my pear.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.240
I'll sell it to you for one wen.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.560
Let me pick two big ones.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Thank you.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.397
In the future,

00:02:44.421 --> 00:02:46.036
if I can marry someone

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.276
as pretty and kind as you,

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.580
I'll be so blessed.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.680
You have a silver tongue.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.070
Here you go.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.860
Sure.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.560
Come back again if they are good.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.400
Take another look.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:59.460
This is good.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.490
- No, thanks.
- Miss, take another one.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.280
Bamboo baskets!

Take a look at my bamboo basket!

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:11.910
Madam,

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.930
your ribs look good.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.180
Yes. They are all fresh.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.060
I only have seven wen on me.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.396
Lamb offal only costs three wen.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.580
Let me get you one jin of it.

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.020
I'm not greedy

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.520
but my wife

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.340
is eight months pregnant now.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:36.930
She's going to give birth soon.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.596
However, I'm poor

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.420
and cannot afford to
buy nourishment for her.

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:42.690
Forget it.

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:44.900
Here. Take it for seven wen.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.240
Thank you, madam.

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:53.250
Thank you, madam.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.620
Sure. Take care.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.120
All right.

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.250
Mister!

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.216
Do you want to ride in the coach?

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.810
Where are you going?

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.336
Northern foot of the Qinling Mountain,

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.900
Yulong Ridge.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.360
Seven wen.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.150
Mister,

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:14.666
I shopped at the market

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:15.990
and bought many offerings.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.060
I only have three wen left.

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:20.510
Offerings?

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.040
I'm going to the mountains to
pay respects to my dead wife.

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.350
She passed away three years ago.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.980
I purposely rushed from
the north to the Capital

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:34.690
to pay respects to her.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.180
You are pitiful.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.120
Get on.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.160
Thank you.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:47.270
We are leaving.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.560
All right!

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.360
Mister,

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:14.930
did you get the wrong place?

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.000
This place is full of mountains.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.160
There's no grave here.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:19.820
She isn't buried here.

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:21.540
She died here.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:23.720
Three years ago,

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:24.910
she was on a journey at night

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.360
and

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:27.560
she encountered bandits.

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:33.570
Forget it.

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:34.830
Keep it.

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:35.980
You're in the wilderness.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.420
You need to spend money

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:38.750
to take a carriage back.

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:42.830
Thank you, sir!

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:46.510
Thank you!

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:16.990
Everyone, you've worked hard.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.490
Later, I'll request the general

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:21.570
to arrange more manpower

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.370
so you'll get fewer shifts.

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:52.560
I am Wang Pu,

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.010
General Fengshan's messenger.

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:56.750
I have been asked

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:58.620
to come see you.

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:01.220
Huben sent someone here again?

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.930
Does Yan Fengshan
have something to tell me?

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:21.810
Yes. Of course.

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:24.060
General Fengshan wants me

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:26.060
to improve your meal.

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.670
Is Liu Ziyan dead?

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.030
What a fine prediction, Sir.

00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:58.950
He's indeed dead.

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:01.100
Who killed him?

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:06.720
There were many people.

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:08.540
As soon as he left here,

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.320
he was in various tough battles.

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:11.590
He got wounded in every battle

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.520
and finally died in the wilderness.

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:16.690
In the end, a long, sharp
blade still breaks easily.

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:21.570
I heard he had served you for three years.

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.620
It is an honor for him

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:25.920
to be remembered by you.

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:30.710
Served me?

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.720
Liu Ziyan was the best assassin of Huben.

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.610
He would never serve anyone.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.520
He was there to kill me.

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:46.170
However, he was very cautious.

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:48.760
We spent day after day together,

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.130
and through our interactions,

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.170
he probed me for three years.

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:55.826
But he couldn't

00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:57.270
find a chance to kill me.

00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:00.070
An assassination that lasted three years?

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.320
No wonder

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.380
even General Fengshan

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:05.950
called Liu Ziyan

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:08.290
a blade that no one could wield.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.330
I heard

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:15.030
you can kill with anything in this world.

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:16.720
No one in this world

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:17.870
can best you.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.960
Liu Ziyan was biting off
more than he could chew.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Sir.

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:40.430
The general did not ask me to kill you.

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:41.590
I'm not that brave either.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000
The soup isn't poisoned.

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.610
The Wuxi Mountain is covered in snow,

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.060
and there's a vast grassland below it.

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:17.420
This is the taste

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:19.790
of the lamb that lived there.

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:22.180
You boiled it in water

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:24.880
and added a pinch of salt.

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:28.910
Young man,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.540
were you there?

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:33.510
No.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.200
I came from the city.

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:37.590
I bought the lamb in the city.

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:41.730
The person who went to your homeland

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:43.900
was General Fengshan.

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:48.337
He said

00:10:48.361 --> 00:10:50.690
that place had 200,000
men ready to fight in a battle.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:52.930
Anyone will fear that place.

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:55.240
Right now,

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:56.850
even the lamb of Wuxi Mountain

00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:58.690
can be bought in Chang'an.

00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:00.380
That means

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:01.480
the world is at peace.

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:03.540
If you stay here forever,

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:06.030
the world

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:08.180
will continue to be at peace.

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:12.060
Go back and relay a
message to Yan Fengshan.

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.080
Tell him

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:16.080
that I prefer

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.570
the tea of Chang'an now.

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:49.610
Is there still no news of
Yan Fengshan until now?

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:53.690
Looking for one person

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:55.240
in this world

00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:57.370
is like looking for a needle in a haystack.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.166
Moreover, you're looking for

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:02.150
the world's best shadow guard.

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:04.290
It won't be that easy.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.380
You failed your task.

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:09.920
Yet here you are, playing weiqi
with me in a carefree manner

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:12.210
and even surrounding my pieces.

00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:15.140
I failed my task indeed

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:17.040
but my skill at weiqi is good.

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:19.210
With it,

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:22.020
my life is still safe before you.

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:36.900
If you are Yan Fengshan,

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:38.850
what will you do next

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:41.500
after abducting the deposed emperor?

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:45.760
With the emperor in hand, one
can order every marquis around.

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:46.960
Everyone knows that.

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:49.606
Since the founding emperor's time,

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:51.136
regional military commanders
have been appointed.

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:52.980
Everyone has military power.

00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:56.620
These four places, Beiting, Fanyang,

00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:58.496
Long'an, and Zhenxi

00:12:58.520 --> 00:12:59.650
are the strongest.

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:01.770
If I am Yan Fengshan,

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:04.010
I will try to win them over.

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:05.800
Or, perhaps

00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:08.740
I've already won them over.

00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:12.390
As my greatest enemy,

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:15.500
you'd best not let me ally with them.

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:28.120
If I take away the military
authority of these four commanders,

00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:29.970
it will be pointless

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:32.450
even if he allies with them.

00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:39.690
You won't be able to do that.

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:43.090
The four of them

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:44.810
used to serve the founding emperor.

00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:46.660
They are still loyal.

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:48.380
They won't give in so easily.

00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:50.090
Your Majesty,

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:51.540
you need another plan.

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:52.670
You will devise that plan.

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:55.500
You failed your task already.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:03.810
Your Majesty, you have an army.

00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:05.810
They also have their army.

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:07.970
I also have an army.

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:10.786
Summon the four regional
military commanders

00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:11.990
to the Capital.

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.960
I will relinquish my
military authority to you

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:16.500
in front of them.

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:18.150
In this way,

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.400
you are also forcing them
to hand over their authority.

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:24.330
But Baiwenhu Army

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:26.140
is your family's private army.

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:29.850
If there's no war in this world,

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.480
my family no longer needs our own army.

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:34.760
We only need servants.

00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:38.500
Your selflessness

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:40.486
shows

00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:41.690
how scheming I am.

00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:43.900
Sure.

00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:45.390
I'll accept your suggestion.

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:47.450
Give me your military authority

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:49.850
and I'll give you the position

00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:51.420
behind me.

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:55.600
I am a cripple.

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:00.420
I prefer sitting in a wheelchair.

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:06.420
Just do as I say

00:15:06.421 --> 00:15:17.295
(Watch on www.dramacool.club Support Admin)

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:10.760
so Yan Fengshan will have no way out of this.

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:14.110
I'll do as you say as well.

00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:16.630
Moreover,

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:17.850
there's one more thing

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.720
that I want to ask you, Your Majesty.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.910
Han Ziling whom I chose initially

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:25.280
was killed by Your Majesty.

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:28.900
Was the person Your
Majesty chose after that.

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:31.450
White Hair?

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:36.610
White Hair?

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:40.570
I've never heard this name for so long.

00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:45.060
That's right. It was him.

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:47.660
The last person of the Liu family.

00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:49.660
His father founded

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:51.100
the Huben Army.

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:53.090
Using him to defeat the Huben Army

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:56.210
is the most suitable choice.

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:03.260
I know something

00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:04.890
about what happened to the Liu family.

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:06.780
It's not easy

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:09.400
for a child of that age to
escape the Huben Army's pursuit

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:10.490
and survive.

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:12.900
He was born with white hair.

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:14.660
As he grew up,

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.690
his hair slowly turned black.

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:20.540
Someone who was born with rare traits

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:22.210
won't die so easily.

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:24.140
Were you friends with him

00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:25.510
in the past?

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:28.480
We were.

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:31.870
I hope

00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:34.540
to meet him again.

00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:37.500
Taking away the military authority

00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:40.690
and give Yan Fengshan no way out.

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:43.930
He hands over the Baiwenhu Army

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:46.320
so Your Majesty will have no worries.

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:49.260
Gu Yu is very aware of the bigger picture.

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:51.600
Someone like him

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:53.720
is rare.

00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:55.900
Do you think he won't realize

00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:58.330
this is all a part of our schemes?

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.180
It is my scheme.

00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:05.170
He won't begrudge Your Majesty at all.

00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:49.260
What are you doing today?

00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:51.310
What's wrong?

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:55.046
Aren't we using someone else's residence?

00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:56.700
Then we should get some new furniture

00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:57.980
and clean the place.

00:17:58.680 --> 00:17:59.300
After all,

00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:00.790
we have to live our lives here.

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:03.590
Live our lives?

00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:05.710
What? Are you cooking tonight

00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:06.750
so I can relax?

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:08.170
I can't do that.

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:09.260
My cooking is bad.

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:11.300
Your noodles taste better.

00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:12.260
You can cook for now.

00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:13.700
Once I learn from you,

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:15.176
I'll be in charge of both of your meals.

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.526
When you learn how to cook,

00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:18.090
I will be 60 years old by then.

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:19.746
That's enough. Don't do unnecessary things.

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:20.770
I just finished sweeping.

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:22.410
Go and wash the bowls.

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:25.960
Sure.

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:26.850
I'll go and wash the bowls.

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:28.470
Remember to cook the noodles later.

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:47.830
Huai'an.

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:49.740
Are we going

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:51.910
to keep living in the house.

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:53.660
Bai Wan lent us?

00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:55.700
Before she left,

00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:58.500
she left this place to me

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:02.220
because she wanted someone

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:05.060
to be in this house.

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:14.740
Every time I see his face,

00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:18.170
it'll remind me of Zhang Mo.

00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:23.570
But the real Zhang Mo is...

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:29.440
We.

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:32.650
Always have to move on.

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:36.610
I can't kill him,

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:39.300
yet I need him to stay by my side.

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:45.586
I need to get along with him

00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:46.610
in another way.

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:02.200
Come in.

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:17.200
Speak.

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:21.700
[To Yanniang]

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:33.240
Today,

00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:34.810
I wrote a letter.

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:36.696
I want to send it

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:37.960
to Zhang Mo's family at Huzhou.

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:39.510
On the letter,

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:40.976
I said I had made enough dowry

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000
for the daughter,

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:43.460
but business

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:44.950
had been very good in the Capital.

00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:46.550
Therefore, I said wanted to stay

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:47.850
and make more money.

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:49.880
I've only written one letter.

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:51.750
I hope

00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:54.550
my wife and children can
put their minds at ease.

00:20:58.440 --> 00:20:59.440
That said,

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:02.300
I tried to copy Zhang Mo's handwriting.

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:04.870
I don't know how well I did.

00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:07.300
I hope you can check it for me.

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:12.480
Why are you doing this?

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.120
I want to atone for my crime.

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:20.850
It's the loss of a life.

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:22.400
How do you atone for it?

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:24.540
I'll atone with my life then.

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:27.286
Aren't you going to use
me to defeat Yan Fengshan

00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:28.370
and the Huben Army?

00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:30.220
When you think of a way,

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:32.200
send me.

00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:38.130
Liu Ziyan is dead.

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:41.610
Qingyi has also been captured.

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:44.700
They've lost two great
Huben leaders in the city.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.170
Yan Fengshan

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:49.570
will surely act again.

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:56.850
When the Huben Army causes another trouble,

00:21:58.240 --> 00:21:59.800
it'll be our chance for a breakthrough.

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:01.790
Perhaps,

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:03.540
you'll be useful.

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:05.160
I understand.

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:07.500
When the day comes,

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.000
I won't blink

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.220
even if I die.

00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:22.780
Leave the letter.

00:22:28.550 --> 00:22:29.550
You may leave.

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:31.980
[To Yanniang]
If the handwriting is similar enough,

00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:33.580
I will send the letter out for you.

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:20.160
Speaking of which,

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:22.086
there's a scholar

00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:23.956
at the Lide Ward in Luoyang.

00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:25.060
His surname is Wang.

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:27.540
We'll call him Wang Sheng for now.

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:28.880
He loves to drink.

00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:30.810
He must drink a few cups every day.

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:33.090
[Pangtou, Baiwenhu Member] One day,

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:35.060
he was drunk again.

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:37.526
He wobbled back home,

00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:38.950
lay on his bed,

00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:40.940
and fell asleep.

00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:42.250
When he was sleeping,

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:43.700
one of his hands

00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:47.140
touched the ground.

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:48.806

[Shan, Baiwenhu Member]

And was worried that he might catch a cold,

00:23:50.861 --> 00:23:52.786
so she quickly approached him

00:23:52.810 --> 00:23:54.366
to tuck his hand

00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:57.420
back into his bed.

00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:59.150

00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:04.670
Suddenly!

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:08.400
Why did you shout?

00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:10.630
I thought you weren't afraid.

00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:11.990
I'm not afraid.

00:24:12.670 --> 00:24:13.000
All right.

00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:13.880
You are not afraid.

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:15.180
Give me your hand then.

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:16.640
Give it to me.

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:19.200
Let me hold onto your hand.

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:21.600
Suddenly,

00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:24.436
a large hand reached out from underground

00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:26.856
and grasped Wang Sheng's hand.

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:28.916
It started pulling him underground.

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:30.520
It kept pulling.

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:32.620
His wife was afraid

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:34.036
and called for help.

00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:36.620
Someone! Save my husband!

00:24:36.670 --> 00:24:39.420
Her neighbors came to help her

00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:40.566
and they saw Wang Sheng

00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:41.117
was about

00:24:41.141 --> 00:24:42.541
to be pulled underground like this.

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:44.040
They quickly tried to fish him out.

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:45.860
Wang Sheng, come out!

00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:47.570
It was useless.

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:50.736
The large hand was too powerful

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:52.016
and it dragged Wang Sheng

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:54.020
underground.

00:24:55.610 --> 00:24:55.910
That's...

00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:57.330
As I was saying,

00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:58.850
Wang Sheng was pulled

00:24:58.990 --> 00:25:00.026
underground

00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:01.290
and turned into a skeleton.

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:04.116
His wife couldn't eat and drink

00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:05.770
because she missed her husband.

00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:07.490
One night,

00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:10.250
his wife had a dream.

00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:11.680
She saw

00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:14.590
her husband coming
back to find her at night.

00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:16.140
He approached her.

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:18.300
He got closer

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:20.220
and closer.

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:21.460
Suddenly!

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:28.380
Didn't you say you weren't afraid?

00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:32.406
You're so annoying.

00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:33.140
What's that smell?

00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:33.916
Something is burnt.

00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:34.516
The porridge!

00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:35.156
Hurry, the porridge!

00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:35.536
Hurry!

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:36.076
The porridge.

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:37.300
The porridge smells nice.

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:40.880
- General!
- General!

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:42.860
All of you are enjoying your meal.

00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:44.027
I'm sure you haven't forgotten

00:25:44.051 --> 00:25:45.811
your duties to guard
the city walls as well.

00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:51.316
The general is busy with official matters.

00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:52.620
He toils all day long.

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:54.976
He only returns to his
residence to rest at midnight.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.320
When he passed by the city walls,

00:25:56.370 --> 00:25:58.116
he heard your chatter and laughter.

00:25:58.140 --> 00:25:59.140
It was so lively.

00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:00.640
If news of this spreads,

00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:02.860
the reputation of Baiwenhu
Army's strict discipline

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:04.340
will be just a joke.

00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:09.110
General.

00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:11.930
While it is true that I slack and eat a lot,

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:15.020
this was mainly because Shan was hungry

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:16.100
so

00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:17.730
I gathered everyone

00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:19.190
to have some porridge.

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:20.480
I was wrong.

00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:22.300
Please punish me.

00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:24.210
What did you do wrong?

00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:27.820
I... I...

00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:30.490
I know the Huben Army is still in the city.

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:31.970
But I paid them no mind

00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:35.100
and even fooled around with Shan.

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:36.280
No.

00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:38.110
Your mistake

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:41.890
is that you're having porridge here

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:43.380
without inviting me.

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:47.850
Right.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.610
Why didn't any of you

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:50.896
invite the general to eat porridge?

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:51.807
Get up quickly

00:26:51.831 --> 00:26:52.906
and invite the general over.

00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:54.156
General, please come here.

00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:55.540
- General, over here.
- Come here.

00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:57.940
All of you were screaming and shouting.

00:26:58.350 --> 00:26:59.856
You must be sharing haunted stories again.

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:00.370
No.

00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:01.510
We were joking.

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:03.740
Shan is timid.

00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:04.500
Pangtou,

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:05.940
you shouldn't bully

00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:06.700
and scare him.

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:08.330
I was just horsing around.

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:11.170
General,

00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:13.046
I am a Baiwenhu member.

00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:14.340
I'm not afraid of ghosts.

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:16.810
General, it's like this.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.540
We are sharing haunted stories

00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:21.370
to make this place lively

00:27:21.790 --> 00:27:23.330
so everyone can be happy.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.610
I didn't intend to scare everyone.

00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:27.740
Pangtou is great at livening the mood.

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:29.890
It's my fault

00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:31.376
for spoiling everyone's mood.

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:32.496
Not at all.

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:34.086
All right. I'll drink a cup as punishment.

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:34.780
No need.

00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:35.780
There's no wine.

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:37.016
I'll take a sip of porridge.

00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:38.040
Sure.

00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:40.456
- General.
- General

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:41.480
I burned my tongue.

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:43.940
You scared us this time.

00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:45.756
Everyone.

00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:46.410
Come.

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:46.796
Everyone.

00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:47.820
- Come.
- Come.

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:08.500
Mister.

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:10.266
Where have all the sellers

00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:11.290
gone to?

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:13.820
My mother wants me to
buy two jin of pork shoulder.

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:16.520
Something good

00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:17.780
will happen tonight.

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:20.280
You want pork shoulder?

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:22.800
Let me help you.

00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:50.630
Little boy,

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:52.480
you should go home immediately.

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:53.760
Later,

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.250
there'll be absolute chaos.

00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:11.466
Be careful!

00:29:11.490 --> 00:29:12.490
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:13.540
Over here.

00:29:13.910 --> 00:29:14.540
Carry the general to the brick road

00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:15.670
so it's easier to push.

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:21.760
I've told you

00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:23.190
to use the lift.

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:25.040
What are you talking about?

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:26.450
I had fun chatting with you.

00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:27.606
Sending you down

00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:28.630
is fine.

00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:29.760
Yes.

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:33.060
It's late at night now.

00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:34.430
When the sun rises,

00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:35.910
all of you

00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:38.140
should return to camp and sleep well.

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:40.326
Farewell, General.

00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:41.350
Farewell, General.

00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:57.800
It's rare for me

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:00.600
to see you smiling since you
entered Chang'an, General.

00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:03.540
I grew up in the army.

00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:05.300
Naturally, I'll feel

00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:06.630
more relaxed

00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:07.920
being with the soldiers.

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:10.890
Later,

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:12.700
I inherited the title

00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:14.310
and took command of the military.

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:16.990
I live beside the emperor.

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:21.650
I have no choice but to
show another facade to others.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.410
General, your position demands you

00:30:24.910 --> 00:30:25.910
to uphold many standards.

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:27.860
You can hardly be relaxed.

00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:29.830
It won't be long.

00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:34.550
The regional military commanders
will enter the capital next month.

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:36.050
According to the plan,

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:38.480
I will also hand over my military authority.

00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:41.590
Once the commander of
Baiwenhu Army changes,

00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:43.780
I'll be free.

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:45.720
General...

00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:47.560
Xiao Wuyang

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:50.250
is a trustworthy emperor.

00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:52.780
When the other commanders and I

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:54.860
give him our seals,

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:56.780
the fight for power will be no more.

00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:59.060
With no way out for Yan Fengshan,

00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:02.170
the battle won't happen.

00:31:03.150 --> 00:31:04.150
Then,

00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:06.410
no one will die.

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:15.780
How unlucky.

00:31:16.390 --> 00:31:17.970
I still need to wash the dishes.

00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:30.080
Pangtou?

00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:33.950
Are you trying to scare me again?

00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:41.450
We are under attack!

00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:44.760
It's an ambush!

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:02.930
I recognize that.

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:04.730
That's Baiwenhu's arrow of command.

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:45.276
Hurry!

00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:46.300
Yes!

00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:54.690
Throw them down.

00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:55.870
Yes.

00:33:26.890 --> 00:33:27.890
Let's go.

00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:44.350
There are so many of them.

00:33:44.770 --> 00:33:45.770
This is so cruel.

00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:48.420
All these human lives!

00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:51.300
I wonder who did this.

00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:56.300
General.

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:03.580
Help me get down.

00:34:05.770 --> 00:34:06.770
Don't look.

00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:08.560
It's fine. Don't be afraid.

00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:10.120
There are assassins!

00:35:12.490 --> 00:35:13.016
Run!

00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:13.730
Protect the general!

00:35:13.850 --> 00:35:14.850
Yes!

00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:39.310
Stop!

00:35:39.930 --> 00:35:41.100
- General!
- General!

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:48.420
Are you the one who killed my soldiers?

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:50.320
Yes.

00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:56.170
I did this tonight

00:35:57.590 --> 00:35:58.730
because I want

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:00.570
you to come with me, General Gu.

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:01.840
General!

00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:03.030
Stop!

00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:06.130
I don't want to kill him.

00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:09.460
After a while,

00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:11.130
I will send General Gu back.

00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:13.210
Before that,

00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:14.980
I hope the Baiwenhu Army

00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:16.980
won't do anything reckless.

00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:19.190
Otherwise,

00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:21.610
when General Gu returns,

00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:25.060
he won't be just a crippled man.

00:36:26.590 --> 00:36:28.730
Are you aware of the consequences?

00:36:51.310 --> 00:36:52.227
Your Majesty.

00:36:52.251 --> 00:36:53.770
General Gu was attacked.

00:37:32.070 --> 00:37:33.550
Gu Yu is an old acquaintance of mine.

00:37:34.070 --> 00:37:35.070
I came here

00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:37.070
to save Gu Yu.

00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:39.050
I underestimated the enemy.

00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:43.500
I should have protected
the general fiercely

00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:45.980
and not left him.

00:37:47.590 --> 00:37:49.170
Given what the Huben Army did tonight,

00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:53.390
Gu Yu wouldn't have been safe

00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:57.720
even if Xiao Wuyang were beside him.

00:37:59.370 --> 00:38:00.370
Don't worry.

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:01.880
I have my own way

00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:03.620
to rescue Gu Yu.

00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:05.540
Right now,

00:38:06.590 --> 00:38:08.020
the only place to hide Gu Yu

00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:11.570
is the Hidden Soldier Alley.

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:32.560
I wanted to meet His Majesty

00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:34.790
but meeting you is the
same, Chancellor Gao.

00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:37.420
Hearing that Gu Yu was being attacked,

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:39.116
His Majesty wanted to leave the palace

00:38:39.140 --> 00:38:40.190
but I stopped him.

00:38:41.650 --> 00:38:42.650
Well done.

00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:44.460
Just in case it's another trap.

00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:49.860
How's your injury?

00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:53.250
I'm fine.

00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:55.770
Qingyi has been captured

00:38:56.110 --> 00:38:57.290
and Liu Ziyan is dead.

00:38:57.710 --> 00:39:00.570
You did well against the Huben Army alone.

00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:02.350
I didn't make the wrong choice

00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:03.940
by choosing you.

00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:06.090
But losing Gu Yu

00:39:07.710 --> 00:39:08.900
is a loss.

00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:13.790
The regional military commanders
are entering the Capital next month.

00:39:14.190 --> 00:39:15.570
According to Gu Yu's plan,

00:39:16.190 --> 00:39:18.830
he will first hand over the military
command of the Baiwenhu Army.

00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:21.130
That act will also prompt

00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:23.680
the other commanders to
hand over their military authority.

00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:24.990
Then,

00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:26.280
Yan Fengshan

00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:27.900
will have no one to ally with.

00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:31.170
It is a good move indeed.

00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:32.760
In that case,

00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:35.820
you need to make sure

00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:37.780
the move succeeds.

00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:39.650
You mustn't let Gu Yu defect,

00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:42.090
even at the cost of killing him.

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:50.300
Chancellor Gao, you sure are devoted

00:39:51.150 --> 00:39:53.490
to securing His Majesty's dynasty.

00:39:56.110 --> 00:39:57.210
But Chancellor Gao,

00:39:58.430 --> 00:39:59.430
don't forget.

00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:02.340
Gu Yu is a general.

00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:04.940
When a soldier bleeds,

00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:07.340
he will take revenge.

00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:11.300
He will never defect to the Huben Army.

00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:17.010
That's for the best.

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:22.690
I am an old acquaintance of Gu Yu.

00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:24.276
If I'm going to rescue him,

00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:25.530
I will protect him forever.

00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:28.650
Once the military power
has been handed over,

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:30.860
I hope you don't

00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:34.010
abandon those who help you, Chancellor Gao.

00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:38.720
I might

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.240
or might not do that.

00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:18.510
Nasty One.

00:41:19.950 --> 00:41:20.950
Nasty One!

00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:24.150
You're the nasty one.

00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:26.280
Collect the laundry.

00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:29.550
How annoying.

00:41:30.110 --> 00:41:31.110
I noticed it now.

00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:32.920
Living

00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:34.236
is just working

00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:35.260
and working

00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:36.680
without any break.

00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:39.440
What's wrong with you today?

00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:41.610
Weren't you all fired up a few days ago?

00:41:42.070 --> 00:41:43.710
Why have you suddenly become so dejected?

00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:45.320
That was

00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:46.400
a few days ago.

00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:47.720
This is

00:41:47.950 --> 00:41:49.090
me right now.

00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:51.210
Perseverance is a virtue, young man.

00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:55.540
I'm leaving.

00:42:00.430 --> 00:42:01.430
Where are you going?

00:42:02.070 --> 00:42:03.750
Gu Yu has been abducted by the Huben Army.

00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:05.070
If I'm not mistaken,

00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:08.030
they will imprison him at
the Hidden Soldier Alley.

00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:09.630
So,

00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:11.750
I need to infiltrate the
Hidden Soldier Alley

00:42:12.110 --> 00:42:13.130
to rescue Gu Yu.
