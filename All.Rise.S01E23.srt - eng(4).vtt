00:01:50.107 --> 00:01:51.784
(Yan Fei eliminated, Guo Xiaoyu 2)

00:01:51.784 --> 00:01:53.832
(Ren Jiatong 1, Jiang Chen 1)

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:56.232
Jiatong.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:57.416
Look.

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.350
He Fan said online

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.791
Ms. Bai used improper persuasive
and aggressive questioning,

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.071
causing her excessive mental stress
and fainting.

00:02:05.871 --> 00:02:06.591
I'm so pissed off!

00:02:06.591 --> 00:02:08.328
(Bai Xiao used coercion and persuasion,)
All the comments below attack Ms. Bai.

00:02:08.328 --> 00:02:08.910
(caused me excessive mental stress)

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:09.711
(and symptoms of hallucination.)
How could this happen?

00:02:09.711 --> 00:02:10.591
(I even fainted from mental stress.)
I'm furious.

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.431
Even Ms. Bai can be cyberbullied.

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.910
Then,

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.711
I might as well pack up and go home.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.711
(If your home needs support,)

00:02:23.711 --> 00:02:24.311
(just ask.)

00:02:24.431 --> 00:02:25.391
Remember to call me.

00:02:25.871 --> 00:02:26.472
Remember.

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.070
Jun An trains lawyers.

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.790
Not robots.

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.720
Jiatong.

00:02:33.111 --> 00:02:33.736
Jiatong.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:37.470
I should've accompanied

00:02:38.151 --> 00:02:39.470
Ms. Bai there.

00:02:45.148 --> 00:02:47.784
(Jiatong, I saw this online.)

00:02:47.784 --> 00:02:50.472
(Why does it say she's your mentor?)

00:02:50.472 --> 00:02:53.448
(Didn't you say
she wasn't coaching your competition?)

00:02:53.448 --> 00:02:55.528
(Jiatong, you mustn't have
any contact with her.)

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:57.350
Had breakfast yet?

00:02:57.871 --> 00:02:58.831
I got an extra sandwich.

00:02:59.831 --> 00:03:00.670
No, thank you.

00:03:00.711 --> 00:03:01.230
No appetite.

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.910
- Worried about your mom?
- Worried about Ms. Bai.

00:03:07.431 --> 00:03:08.031
I am, too.

00:03:09.031 --> 00:03:10.190
But there's always a way.

00:03:10.551 --> 00:03:12.470
Large-scale online bullying of a lawyer

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:13.871
often relates to their case.

00:03:14.151 --> 00:03:14.991
Or...

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:16.711
relates to some interests.

00:03:18.991 --> 00:03:19.910
I considered Eddie.

00:03:21.031 --> 00:03:22.271
But could there be others?

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:25.431
You suspect Ms. Bai?

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.670
I won't suspect anyone

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:28.230
without proof.

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:30.510
Has Ms. Bai arrived?

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.470
I'm absolutely furious.

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.831
Why is being a lawyer so hard nowadays?

00:03:38.031 --> 00:03:40.271
Besides occupational hazards
like lumbar strain,

00:03:40.271 --> 00:03:41.871
Insomnia and anxiety,

00:03:41.991 --> 00:03:43.431
we have to endure cyberbullying too?

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:44.510
I've never seen

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.151
such a dedicated professional before.

00:03:46.391 --> 00:03:48.151
If even she has to endure this,

00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:48.950
my faith

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.790
in justice will completely collapse.

00:03:52.551 --> 00:03:54.190
When we caused trouble before,

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.991
Ms. Bai might've said harsh things.

00:03:56.111 --> 00:03:57.391
But she always had our backs.

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.271
So now, we must stay calm
and pull ourselves together.

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.111
I looked at this Weibo post.

00:04:02.111 --> 00:04:02.991
Although there are

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.391
indeed many cyberbullies,

00:04:06.391 --> 00:04:08.311
the top comment supports Ms. Bai.

00:04:08.311 --> 00:04:08.936
Look.

00:04:14.111 --> 00:04:15.190
They're releasing more.

00:04:21.271 --> 00:04:22.071
Step one,

00:04:22.631 --> 00:04:23.711
at 2 AM,

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.751
leak info when everyone's asleep.

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.790
This prevents Jun An
from reacting in time.

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:29.071
Step two,

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.550
deliberately plant
opposing paid commenters

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:32.591
to argue in the comments.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.071
One side calls Ms. Bai a killer lawyer.

00:04:35.631 --> 00:04:37.391
The other says online information

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:38.550
is 80% rumor.

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:39.910
Just for attention and traffic.

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:41.071
Step three,

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.031
show evidence when dissed.

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.031
Release round two.

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:46.391
Based on my years

00:04:46.391 --> 00:04:47.990
of internet surfing experience,

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:49.751
there's only one truth.

00:04:52.831 --> 00:04:53.352
What?

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.031
Someone's deliberately setting this up.

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:57.550
Targeting Ms. Bai.

00:04:59.951 --> 00:05:01.191
But why?

00:05:04.071 --> 00:05:04.910
Whatever the reason,

00:05:05.271 --> 00:05:05.790
anyway,

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.751
I think we should

00:05:06.751 --> 00:05:07.751
report our suspicions

00:05:07.751 --> 00:05:08.511
to the firm.

00:05:08.631 --> 00:05:10.071
We can't let Ms. Bai be bullied.

00:05:19.591 --> 00:05:20.136
Ms. Bai.

00:05:22.271 --> 00:05:22.888
Ms. Bai.

00:05:24.391 --> 00:05:26.631
We're investigating who's behind this.

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:28.391
Ms. Bai.

00:05:28.391 --> 00:05:29.591
I checked some IP addresses.

00:05:29.591 --> 00:05:30.591
No discernible pattern.

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:32.990
I've submitted
a complaint to the website,

00:05:33.071 --> 00:05:34.470
demanding removal of the video

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:35.910
and banning the main accounts.

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:37.310
Please authorize me.

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:38.408
May I?

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.624
Sure.

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.951
Thank you.

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:42.310
But

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:43.790
don't let this interfere with

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:44.511
your real work.

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.550
Should we just sit back and do nothing,

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:51.310
and let them keep spreading
lies and slandering you?

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:53.391
Twisting the truth,

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:54.310
no principles,

00:05:54.751 --> 00:05:55.550
only after profit,

00:05:55.591 --> 00:05:56.391
acting unreasonably,

00:05:56.511 --> 00:05:57.230
aiding the wicked,

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:58.711
double-dipping...

00:05:59.511 --> 00:06:01.031
In all my years as a lawyer,

00:06:01.391 --> 00:06:02.870
I've heard insults

00:06:03.271 --> 00:06:04.550
like these and more.

00:06:04.951 --> 00:06:06.350
If I broke down crying

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:07.391
just because of these,

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:08.470
neglected my real work,

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:09.951
and wasted time on these people,

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.071
I might as well
go home and retire early.

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:14.990
Still, thank you all.

00:06:16.031 --> 00:06:16.990
A reminder for you.

00:06:17.391 --> 00:06:18.751
This is your final round.

00:06:20.191 --> 00:06:20.904
Come on.

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.391
No wonder even my role model
couldn't win her over.

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:31.144
Impressive.

00:06:49.031 --> 00:06:49.608
Come in.

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:55.031
Perfect timing.

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:57.550
Could you spare some of that premium tea

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:58.670
you hoard?

00:07:00.191 --> 00:07:03.470
I remember you only
drink coffee, never tea.

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:04.790
Back in college,

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:06.151
you always teased me

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:07.350
about my old-man hobby.

00:07:08.191 --> 00:07:10.711
Earlier, I overheard Xiaoyu
complaining in the pantry.

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:12.071
She said

00:07:12.071 --> 00:07:13.751
her exhausting work

00:07:14.591 --> 00:07:16.511
was probably caused
by that bitter Americano.

00:07:17.071 --> 00:07:18.031
That makes sense to me.

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:20.031
Besides, you look

00:07:20.591 --> 00:07:21.990
quite refreshed after drinking tea.

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:23.310
So I want to try it too.

00:07:24.071 --> 00:07:25.271
I'll bring you some later.

00:07:27.711 --> 00:07:28.951
By the way, Lucy mentioned

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:31.271
you had two client meetings
scheduled today,

00:07:31.591 --> 00:07:33.271
but both were
suddenly canceled by phone.

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:36.591
You don't seem bothered by it.

00:07:37.191 --> 00:07:37.768
That's normal.

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:39.271
This isn't the first time.

00:07:41.271 --> 00:07:42.271
Why not take this chance

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:43.031
to take a break?

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:44.751
Leave the work to me.

00:07:46.151 --> 00:07:47.071
It's been too long

00:07:47.071 --> 00:07:48.230
since you took your girl out.

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:49.591
Use this opportunity

00:07:50.151 --> 00:07:50.670
to unwind.

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:54.191
Why are you worrying like those kids?

00:07:54.751 --> 00:07:55.751
Are you really okay?

00:07:56.191 --> 00:07:56.872
Yes.

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:01.631
If those people saw you now,

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:02.391
they'd be furious.

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:05.870
Your attitude is admirable.

00:08:05.951 --> 00:08:07.191
No anger phase.

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:08.470
Just calm.

00:08:09.831 --> 00:08:10.670
To be honest,

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:13.110
I am pretty angry.

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:16.670
Their slander this time

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:18.031
lacks any creativity.

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:21.151
A few years ago, the rumors

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:22.951
were like,

00:08:23.631 --> 00:08:26.031
I had an affair
with a corporate executive,

00:08:27.071 --> 00:08:29.151
and left my ex-husband with nothing.

00:08:29.271 --> 00:08:30.751
And I yelled at clients.

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:32.351
The craziest one.

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:35.830
I was keeping a colleague from the firm.

00:08:36.631 --> 00:08:38.310
So dramatic and scandalous.

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:40.550
This time, it's just boring nonsense.

00:08:43.231 --> 00:08:44.710
"Keeping a colleague." I like it.

00:08:45.111 --> 00:08:46.710
If you need that, I'm available.

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:49.710
Thanks a lot.

00:08:52.751 --> 00:08:53.288
Alright.

00:08:55.391 --> 00:08:56.991
Enough jokes. Let's talk business.

00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:59.310
We should've done that sooner.

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:00.271
Come.

00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:03.031
Walking in pretending to comfort me.

00:09:03.231 --> 00:09:05.031
Procedures must be followed.

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:07.670
I reviewed Eddie's records
since joining.

00:09:07.944 --> 00:09:08.471
(Jiang Yutai)

00:09:08.471 --> 00:09:10.391
(Asia-Pacific Business Director)
He seems quite driven.

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:12.511
He and Yan Da
are indeed childhood friends.

00:09:12.631 --> 00:09:14.550
They've gotten along well
these past few years.

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:16.991
But competition might change that.

00:09:17.471 --> 00:09:19.710
Xingke is a leader
in China's chip industry.

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:20.790
Recently,

00:09:20.871 --> 00:09:22.310
they've actively expanded overseas.

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:24.310
They're the biggest global rival

00:09:24.751 --> 00:09:26.430
to the foreign company Eddie worked for.

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:27.590
Recently,

00:09:28.231 --> 00:09:30.070
they've taken APAC share
from Eddie's company.

00:09:30.871 --> 00:09:32.430
So the company's competitive motivation

00:09:32.871 --> 00:09:33.550
makes sense.

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:35.471
But it seems incomplete.

00:09:36.231 --> 00:09:36.776
Incomplete?

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:40.710
And I've also uncovered something.

00:09:41.231 --> 00:09:42.670
The Legal Director of this company

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:43.830
is my old friend.

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:50.152
Ms. Bai.

00:09:50.751 --> 00:09:51.910
Given your current situation,

00:09:52.151 --> 00:09:54.631
you should keep these old friends away.

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:56.151
Maintain some distance from them.

00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:57.991
I think you're right.

00:09:58.590 --> 00:09:59.751
We're old friends, too.

00:10:00.871 --> 00:10:02.031
How could I be the same?

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:04.190
These flowers

00:10:05.391 --> 00:10:06.351
are sugarcoated bullets.

00:10:06.471 --> 00:10:06.991
Unreliable.

00:10:09.471 --> 00:10:10.056
Fine.

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:11.790
Out of everyone in this world,

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:13.710
you're the most reliable one, Mr. Song.

00:10:14.151 --> 00:10:15.511
I never give sugarcoated bullets.

00:10:15.511 --> 00:10:16.631
What I offer is genuine.

00:10:16.991 --> 00:10:18.991
If I ever find out
who's spreading dirt about you,

00:10:19.231 --> 00:10:20.391
I'll make sure they learn

00:10:20.391 --> 00:10:21.430
what real consequences

00:10:21.871 --> 00:10:22.871
feel like.

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:24.830
That's some dangerous talk.

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:26.670
You're in non-litigation.

00:10:27.231 --> 00:10:29.871
Stop dancing on the edge
of criminal offenses

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:31.070
with reckless testing.

00:10:31.151 --> 00:10:31.670
Got it?

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:32.190
Enough.

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:34.351
Stop teasing me, will you?

00:10:36.271 --> 00:10:36.790
To business.

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:38.511
I have a tennis buddy,

00:10:38.631 --> 00:10:39.391
an industry contact

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:41.910
of Eddie and Yan Da.

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:44.070
We'll eat tomorrow.

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:45.111
You got time?

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:46.792
Yes.

00:10:54.751 --> 00:10:55.430
All still here.

00:10:55.991 --> 00:10:56.670
Still working?

00:10:59.031 --> 00:11:00.430
Don't stay up too late tonight.

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:02.031
Understood, Ms. Bai.

00:11:08.351 --> 00:11:08.936
Ms. Bai.

00:11:14.271 --> 00:11:14.888
Thanks.

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:22.511
What's so funny?

00:11:25.351 --> 00:11:25.960
Here.

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:27.190
I have one too?

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:30.910
Get some calcium.

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:34.351
Still investigating
who planned the leak?

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:35.550
Absolutely.

00:11:36.111 --> 00:11:37.830
The internet isn't lawless territory.

00:11:38.111 --> 00:11:38.910
If they're unaware,

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:40.590
I'll find them
and educate them properly.

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:42.670
Ms. Bai said she didn't need help.

00:11:43.271 --> 00:11:44.471
She just

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:46.031
doesn't want to trouble us.

00:11:48.231 --> 00:11:49.151
Is projecting

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:51.991
our own ideas
onto our superior appropriate?

00:11:52.991 --> 00:11:54.991
Ms. Bai has
such extensive work experience.

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:57.031
If we can see something,

00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:59.070
she can likely see much more.

00:12:00.031 --> 00:12:01.511
Honestly, I trust her completely.

00:12:02.471 --> 00:12:03.550
Ms. Bai is our superior,

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:06.310
but she's also a working woman

00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:07.231
and a single mother.

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:09.511
During her work and parenting,

00:12:09.511 --> 00:12:11.710
she's surely faced countless challenges.

00:12:12.271 --> 00:12:14.351
She's long been accustomed
to bearing things alone.

00:12:14.751 --> 00:12:15.631
She's tough,

00:12:15.871 --> 00:12:17.151
so she doesn't ask for help.

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:18.590
But she still needs it.

00:12:20.351 --> 00:12:20.904
Jiatong.

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:22.751
Just like you before,

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:24.471
claiming you didn't need friends.

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:27.271
But the more I got to know you,

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:29.991
the more I realized
you're warm-hearted inside.

00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:31.871
Be honest.

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:33.190
Don't you need me?

00:12:34.631 --> 00:12:36.430
Don't you need Yan Fei or Jiang Chen?

00:12:39.351 --> 00:12:41.511
Plus, didn't I recently gather everyone

00:12:41.511 --> 00:12:42.871
to help that young girl together?

00:12:43.471 --> 00:12:45.151
I believe people should stick together.

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:47.710
Strong people need to share the load.

00:12:48.151 --> 00:12:48.776
Do you agree?

00:12:56.871 --> 00:12:57.471
Hey?

00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:03.944
Ms. Bai.

00:13:09.151 --> 00:13:09.710
What is it?

00:13:11.111 --> 00:13:11.631
Ms. Bai.

00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:12.631
I'm sorry.

00:13:13.471 --> 00:13:15.151
I took on He Fan's case,

00:13:15.151 --> 00:13:16.070
but I didn't show up.

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:17.950
Now, you're being misunderstood.

00:13:20.231 --> 00:13:21.430
How is your mother now?

00:13:25.871 --> 00:13:26.830
Nothing serious.

00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:29.031
Just some mobility issues.

00:13:29.031 --> 00:13:29.830
She'll be fine.

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:31.368
That's good.

00:13:31.871 --> 00:13:33.871
You should make time
to visit her more often.

00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:35.790
If that's all,

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:36.991
head back to work.

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:50.310
Let's go.

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:51.751
Let me buy you a drink.

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:03.304
Ms. Bai.

00:14:11.111 --> 00:14:12.631
I have another question.

00:14:14.271 --> 00:14:15.016
Go ahead.

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:19.871
After you saw the post,

00:14:22.471 --> 00:14:23.670
was there even for a moment

00:14:25.151 --> 00:14:26.710
that you believed He Fan did faint?

00:14:28.031 --> 00:14:28.790
For example,

00:14:29.151 --> 00:14:30.751
maybe you said something,

00:14:31.151 --> 00:14:33.550
or she genuinely had
poor psychological resilience.

00:14:34.871 --> 00:14:35.400
Ms. Bai.

00:14:36.111 --> 00:14:37.790
Are you truly 100% confident?

00:14:38.751 --> 00:14:39.950
What are you trying to ask me?

00:14:44.271 --> 00:14:45.231
Do you remember,

00:14:45.991 --> 00:14:47.351
years ago, you handled

00:14:47.351 --> 00:14:48.511
a construction accident case?

00:14:49.031 --> 00:14:51.151
You represented the project client,

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:53.151
while the person involved,

00:14:54.351 --> 00:14:55.950
the head of the construction company,

00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:58.471
was called Ren Ping.

00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:02.511
He was my father.

00:15:03.511 --> 00:15:05.670
You spoke with my father back then

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:07.031
about the compensation settlement.

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:08.871
But after that discussion,

00:15:11.031 --> 00:15:12.391
he died of a sudden heart attack.

00:15:15.271 --> 00:15:16.631
You were the last person he saw.

00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:19.950
I remember.

00:15:21.511 --> 00:15:22.830
So he was your father.

00:15:26.351 --> 00:15:27.670
So you think

00:15:28.631 --> 00:15:30.710
your father's death was because of me?

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:32.590
I studied law too.

00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:35.070
I understand your job.

00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:37.430
But honestly,

00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:39.310
these two things are too coincidental.

00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:42.151
It's hard for me not
to connect them and wonder.

00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:48.151
On one hand,
I've worked closely with you

00:15:48.151 --> 00:15:49.670
and spent three months together.

00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:51.751
You've taught me so much.

00:15:52.471 --> 00:15:54.910
I have strong trust
and admiration for you.

00:15:55.751 --> 00:15:56.631
But at the same time,

00:15:59.631 --> 00:16:00.950
I can't shake off

00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:02.550
this unsettling feeling inside me.

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:05.670
He was my father.

00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:08.271
I can't be purely rational.

00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:10.830
I don't want to keep guessing.

00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:13.631
I want to ask you directly.

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:18.670
I appreciate your honesty.

00:16:21.351 --> 00:16:22.670
How did you know

00:16:23.511 --> 00:16:25.590
that I was the last person
your father saw?

00:16:28.151 --> 00:16:30.391
When my dad was rushed to the hospital,

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:32.190
I saw you there.

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:35.031
Later, my mom told me

00:16:38.631 --> 00:16:40.111
that after my dad talked with you,

00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:42.231
his heart felt unwell.

00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:44.471
Finally, he didn't survive.

00:16:46.751 --> 00:16:49.031
Did your mother tell you this herself?

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:54.111
Your mom really

00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:55.631
has had it tough.

00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:57.416
Ms. Bai.

00:16:57.991 --> 00:16:58.910
No matter what you say,

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:01.550
I'll believe it all.

00:17:02.471 --> 00:17:03.670
No matter what others say,

00:17:04.431 --> 00:17:05.751
you're my career role model.

00:17:06.431 --> 00:17:08.031
I really want to keep working with you.

00:17:10.711 --> 00:17:12.191
But I truly need to ask you,

00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:16.350
was it really you?

00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:18.991
I just want

00:17:18.991 --> 00:17:20.630
to hear an answer from you directly.

00:17:24.511 --> 00:17:25.350
This question.

00:17:26.191 --> 00:17:27.031
I can't answer.

00:17:34.364 --> 00:17:35.150
(Relationship Web)

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:37.110
This is the relationship web I compiled.

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:38.590
See if you have anything to add.

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:13.128
Miss Yan.

00:18:16.511 --> 00:18:17.128
Thank you.

00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:19.464
Well?

00:18:19.991 --> 00:18:20.991
How have you been lately?

00:18:22.031 --> 00:18:23.671
Not good. I've been bullied.

00:18:24.031 --> 00:18:24.870
Who dares bully you?

00:18:26.431 --> 00:18:27.630
Many people want to resign.

00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:29.110
In every department.

00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:31.471
Some even want entire teams to leave.

00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:33.390
Don't worry.

00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:34.231
Don't worry.

00:18:34.231 --> 00:18:35.310
Let's handle this together.

00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:37.790
Or I'll talk to Xingke's legal team

00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:39.031
and HR department.

00:18:39.031 --> 00:18:39.790
See what we can do.

00:18:41.191 --> 00:18:41.830
Or I...

00:18:42.471 --> 00:18:43.231
Let me think.

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:46.031
Just kidding.

00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:49.751
That situation did exist before,

00:18:50.431 --> 00:18:51.711
but it's much better now.

00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:54.150
After all, I'm pretty capable myself.

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:55.390
I've done a lot these days.

00:19:00.911 --> 00:19:02.110
The biggest headache now

00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:03.031
is Eddie.

00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:05.431
At this crucial moment,

00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:07.711
how can a grown man just vanish?

00:19:07.951 --> 00:19:09.031
There must be a problem.

00:19:09.751 --> 00:19:11.630
Plus, he's really close with Yan Da.

00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:13.751
Why would he want to harm him?

00:19:15.191 --> 00:19:16.110
I just can't get it.

00:19:18.751 --> 00:19:20.390
Want to go unwind at our usual spot?

00:19:28.951 --> 00:19:30.431
Thanks for lending me your shoulder

00:19:31.671 --> 00:19:32.511
last time.

00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:33.928
Not at all.

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:35.870
I know you've been tired lately.

00:19:39.711 --> 00:19:40.590
You know what?

00:19:41.231 --> 00:19:42.390
I'm actually dependable too.

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:46.110
Girls like us who have trained
in ballet since childhood

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:47.630
have incredibly strong backs.

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:49.830
Even though

00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:51.630
some things happened at home recently

00:19:51.951 --> 00:19:53.790
really threw me off at first.

00:19:54.751 --> 00:19:55.911
But don't think

00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:57.751
that I can only rely on you.

00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:58.911
Sometimes,

00:19:58.911 --> 00:20:01.031
we can actually lean on each other.

00:20:01.191 --> 00:20:02.110
Or when you're the one

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:03.350
who needs support,

00:20:04.191 --> 00:20:05.431
you can lean on me.

00:20:06.031 --> 00:20:06.728
Got it?

00:20:07.751 --> 00:20:08.310
I trust you.

00:20:09.271 --> 00:20:09.864
Next time.

00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:16.991
Ever since you brought
me here to see the stars,

00:20:17.671 --> 00:20:19.590
I've actually come alone many times,

00:20:21.191 --> 00:20:22.390
though none were as lovely.

00:20:24.031 --> 00:20:25.070
Whenever you want to come,

00:20:25.951 --> 00:20:26.711
I'll come with you.

00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:28.424
Really?

00:20:28.711 --> 00:20:29.320
I mean it.

00:20:32.511 --> 00:20:33.350
Let me tell you.

00:20:33.911 --> 00:20:35.550
I only recognize one constellation.

00:20:35.991 --> 00:20:37.110
That's Orion.

00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:40.271
I can't tell any others.

00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:42.951
But it's okay.

00:20:43.671 --> 00:20:44.991
The stars are what's magical.

00:20:47.751 --> 00:20:50.590
Don't dismiss them just
because they're tiny specks of light.

00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:52.991
Behind that glitter,

00:20:52.991 --> 00:20:55.431
there are cosmic wonders unfolding.

00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:57.671
So, it's

00:20:58.870 --> 00:20:59.751
quite romantic.

00:21:02.911 --> 00:21:03.951
Remember when you last

00:21:03.951 --> 00:21:06.150
told me about Venus, the goddess?

00:21:07.671 --> 00:21:08.630
She had this lover,

00:21:08.911 --> 00:21:09.550
the god of war.

00:21:10.471 --> 00:21:11.711
They had a son together later,

00:21:12.471 --> 00:21:13.191
Cupid.

00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:14.711
God of love.

00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:18.110
The goddess of love and beauty

00:21:18.231 --> 00:21:19.751
and the warrior god

00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:21.070
gave birth to love.

00:21:21.671 --> 00:21:23.310
So the stars and myths

00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:24.590
have been showing us all along

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:26.110
that love is beautiful,

00:21:27.271 --> 00:21:29.431
but it carries inherent ferocity

00:21:29.991 --> 00:21:31.110
and can wound people.

00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:36.751
So Mr. Zhou,

00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:40.350
when loving someone,

00:21:41.231 --> 00:21:42.671
should we sometimes

00:21:42.671 --> 00:21:44.870
set aside
that careful cost-benefit analysis

00:21:45.231 --> 00:21:46.150
and fear of pain?

00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:49.630
Sure, we lawyers

00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:52.031
treat risk assessment
and tradeoff calculations

00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:53.870
as professional reflexes.

00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:10.390
That's why loving and lawyering

00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:12.630
are fundamentally at odds.

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:14.728
Right?

00:22:16.231 --> 00:22:16.870
Perhaps.

00:22:18.031 --> 00:22:18.696
I guess so.

00:22:39.803 --> 00:22:42.120
(Bai Xiao, He Fan)

00:22:43.355 --> 00:22:45.288
(Yan Da, Xingke CEO
Eddie, Airuiqi APAC Business Director)

00:22:45.288 --> 00:22:47.048
(Yan Da's girlfriend, Zhang Xiaomei
Eddie persuaded Zhang to go abroad)

00:22:47.048 --> 00:22:48.584
(Bai Xiao represents Yan Da)

00:22:48.584 --> 00:22:49.608
(He Fan, Yan Da's assistant)

00:22:49.608 --> 00:22:51.240
(Eddie introduced He Fan)

00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:02.751
Step out. There's something.

00:23:03.431 --> 00:23:03.951
What is it?

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:05.191
About Ms. Bai.

00:23:05.431 --> 00:23:06.070
I'll tell you.

00:23:22.711 --> 00:23:23.870
So you asked me out for this?

00:23:25.511 --> 00:23:27.110
Since we joined Jun An,

00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:27.870
very few people

00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:29.790
have ever gotten under your skin.

00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:30.991
Ms. Bai is among them.

00:23:31.751 --> 00:23:33.511
When she passed
our conference room earlier,

00:23:33.511 --> 00:23:34.951
your whole expression shifted.

00:23:35.471 --> 00:23:36.136
What's going on?

00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:41.231
This mess started partly because of me.

00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:43.271
I should monitor
how my supervisor is reacting.

00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:44.590
I want that job offer.

00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:47.550
Did Guo Xiaoyu rub off on you?

00:23:47.550 --> 00:23:49.512
Her idol is Holmes.

00:23:49.896 --> 00:23:52.456
You read detective novels too,

00:23:52.456 --> 00:23:54.728
but you need to work on
your detective skills.

00:23:56.191 --> 00:23:56.951
You're really okay?

00:23:57.711 --> 00:23:59.630
You've been staring
at that whiteboard all day.

00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:00.671
Overworked?

00:24:02.031 --> 00:24:02.590
Office life

00:24:02.951 --> 00:24:03.790
drives people crazy.

00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:05.830
So what'd you find?

00:24:06.911 --> 00:24:07.870
At this exact moment,

00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:10.310
in an organized and premeditated manner,

00:24:10.431 --> 00:24:11.870
aiming at Ms. Bai's professionalism.

00:24:12.471 --> 00:24:13.991
What's their underlying motive?

00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:15.830
If it's connected to Eddie,

00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:17.671
then how did he bribe He Fan?

00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:19.911
I scrolled through countless comments.

00:24:20.271 --> 00:24:21.671
Many people hinted

00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:23.271
Ms. Bai had done similar things.

00:24:24.191 --> 00:24:25.431
So vivid and detailed.

00:24:25.431 --> 00:24:26.870
Like it's their personal experience.

00:24:27.271 --> 00:24:27.830
Those...

00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:35.471
In short,

00:24:36.271 --> 00:24:37.150
I've always felt

00:24:37.471 --> 00:24:39.350
they're targeting Ms. Bai.

00:24:39.471 --> 00:24:40.310
And the mastermind

00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:41.231
knows Ms. Bai well.

00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:43.991
I don't know if I can uncover it.

00:24:44.751 --> 00:24:45.671
But I have to try.

00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:47.830
That's passionate.

00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:49.550
Just like Guo Xiaoyu.

00:24:50.751 --> 00:24:51.390
I'm calm.

00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:54.630
But you were right.

00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:56.671
Ms. Bai is different for me.

00:24:57.751 --> 00:24:58.630
At first,

00:24:59.471 --> 00:25:01.150
I both admired and feared her.

00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:04.150
Gradually, she taught me so much.

00:25:05.471 --> 00:25:07.511
She mentored, scolded
and transformed me.

00:25:08.751 --> 00:25:09.870
During our business trip,

00:25:10.150 --> 00:25:11.751
I felt I discovered another side of her.

00:25:13.031 --> 00:25:14.310
It even gave me the illusion

00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:17.390
that she wasn't just my boss or mentor.

00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:20.350
She could also be my friend.

00:25:20.991 --> 00:25:21.991
Or a comrade-in-arms.

00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:24.630
In short, that feeling.

00:25:26.431 --> 00:25:27.110
Hard to describe.

00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:30.790
I'm envious.

00:25:31.471 --> 00:25:33.231
That word has never applied to me.

00:25:34.991 --> 00:25:36.511
So you want to find the truth for her.

00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:39.830
It's for her.

00:25:40.711 --> 00:25:41.231
And for me.

00:25:43.711 --> 00:25:44.870
Because I need an answer.

00:25:45.231 --> 00:25:46.110
Perhaps this answer

00:25:46.471 --> 00:25:47.110
means nothing

00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:48.070
to others anymore.

00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:49.790
But for me,

00:25:51.031 --> 00:25:51.751
it's crucial.

00:25:56.252 --> 00:26:01.128
(Bai Xiao, Ren Jiatong,
Ren's mother, Ren Ping?)

00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:03.951
What answer?

00:26:09.244 --> 00:26:13.032
(Ren Ping, accident)

00:26:13.116 --> 00:26:14.600
(Ren Ping, death)

00:26:17.116 --> 00:26:18.056
(Scaffold Collapse Causes Mass Injuries)

00:26:18.056 --> 00:26:19.016
(Contractor Under Investigation)

00:26:24.123 --> 00:26:24.936
(Scaffolding suddenly collapsed.)

00:26:24.936 --> 00:26:25.832
(Initial findings suggest
substandard materials.)

00:26:25.832 --> 00:26:27.144
(The public expects the truth
and compensation.)

00:26:31.259 --> 00:26:33.000
(Meanwhile,
the project's client contacted)

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.792
(Lawyers Wang Qin
and Bai Xiao from Manyida.)

00:26:39.388 --> 00:26:42.344
(Lawyers Wang Qin
and Bai Xiao from Manyida.)

00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:02.440
Hello.

00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:03.784
My son.

00:27:03.951 --> 00:27:04.552
Can we talk?

00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:05.870
You fought

00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:06.991
with your girlfriend again?

00:27:09.191 --> 00:27:09.951
A few days ago,

00:27:10.431 --> 00:27:11.951
(Moments: Jiang Chen shared I'm Sorry)
you shared a song

00:27:12.231 --> 00:27:13.310
on Moments late at night.

00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:14.830
That cryptic one.

00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:16.070
Without any lyrics at all.

00:27:16.711 --> 00:27:17.671
Utterly depressing.

00:27:18.511 --> 00:27:19.630
Then the next morning,

00:27:20.191 --> 00:27:21.031
(Jiang Chen: Going all out)
you posted

00:27:21.031 --> 00:27:22.550
a group work photo of you guys.

00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:24.110
Looking all lively and cheerful.

00:27:24.550 --> 00:27:25.431
So you made up then.

00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:27.880
Not bad.

00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:29.271
You know

00:27:29.790 --> 00:27:31.870
it's bad to let your girlfriend
stay mad too long.

00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:32.790
Not hopeless.

00:27:34.550 --> 00:27:35.271
In relationships,

00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:37.630
you can't let anger linger overnight.

00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:38.310
Understand?

00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:40.390
For someone your age,

00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:43.350
you're way too nosy.

00:27:44.231 --> 00:27:46.991
Besides, that music I shared
is called post-rock.

00:27:47.431 --> 00:27:48.471
It's a genre.

00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:50.671
You probably don't listen to it often.

00:27:51.951 --> 00:27:53.751
Hey, kid, stop talking back to me.

00:27:55.511 --> 00:27:56.104
Go on.

00:27:57.150 --> 00:27:58.431
What happened to that girl?

00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:01.991
How did you figure that out?

00:28:02.511 --> 00:28:03.431
Normally,

00:28:03.951 --> 00:28:05.870
you'd never call me.

00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:13.150
Actually, I already have some leads.

00:28:13.471 --> 00:28:14.231
It's just that...

00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:17.310
Could I borrow some
of your valuable time to help me

00:28:17.431 --> 00:28:18.070
sort it out?

00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:19.550
Absolutely!

00:28:20.911 --> 00:28:22.031
As long as you're willing,

00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:23.390
we two can

00:28:24.031 --> 00:28:25.150
stay up all night if needed.

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:28.584
Alright.

00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:31.336
I'll start from the beginning.

00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:43.191
Stop making

00:28:43.191 --> 00:28:44.231
these round trips.

00:28:45.031 --> 00:28:47.110
The high-speed train takes hours.

00:28:47.511 --> 00:28:49.830
It's exhausting.

00:28:50.511 --> 00:28:51.431
It's fine, Mom.

00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:53.191
Stop fussing for now.

00:28:53.790 --> 00:28:55.590
Come talk with me.

00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:02.696
Done drinking.

00:29:09.991 --> 00:29:11.310
Were you listening to me?

00:29:11.951 --> 00:29:13.951
You don't have any contact
with that female lawyer?

00:29:16.431 --> 00:29:17.064
No.

00:29:19.550 --> 00:29:20.271
No?

00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:23.231
Since you were little,
whenever you lied,

00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:24.751
you've avoided eye contact.

00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:26.431
You take after your dad.

00:29:26.991 --> 00:29:28.031
Kind-hearted.

00:29:28.471 --> 00:29:29.310
Capable.

00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:31.390
Thoughtful and meticulous.

00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:34.350
I'm genuinely afraid you'll be deceived.

00:29:34.991 --> 00:29:35.870
Listen to me.

00:29:36.431 --> 00:29:38.671
Nothing good will come from that woman.

00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:39.671
Mom.

00:29:40.550 --> 00:29:42.231
Ms. Bai is a genuinely good person.

00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:44.790
She has contacts here from handling

00:29:44.790 --> 00:29:45.431
a hospital case.

00:29:45.671 --> 00:29:47.790
And she asked them
for help and moved you

00:29:47.951 --> 00:29:48.911
to this quiet ward.

00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:51.390
I also asked her about my dad's case.

00:29:51.711 --> 00:29:52.630
She said nothing.

00:29:55.432 --> 00:29:56.031
Be careful.

00:29:56.031 --> 00:29:56.630
Hold on.

00:29:56.991 --> 00:29:58.671
How can you be so naive?

00:29:59.031 --> 00:30:00.390
You asked her about your dad.

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:01.550
Do you think she'd still

00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:02.911
let you get this job?

00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:04.630
Why couldn't you just wait

00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:06.070
until the competition

00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:07.110
was over?

00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:09.070
You wouldn't listen to me.

00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:10.216
You...

00:30:12.511 --> 00:30:13.192
Mom.

00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:15.191
She isn't that kind of person.

00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:23.511
Hello? Xiaoyu?

00:30:24.550 --> 00:30:26.431
Jiatong, they've released more.

00:30:26.991 --> 00:30:28.991
An audio recording
of Ms. Bai pressing He Fan.

00:30:32.191 --> 00:30:32.711
Look.

00:30:33.390 --> 00:30:35.191
The timeline of the previous footage

00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:37.350
basically aligns with this audio.

00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:38.870
But the video is really blurry.

00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:40.231
Impossible to read the lips.

00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:42.310
So people would mistakenly believe

00:30:42.511 --> 00:30:43.231
that this audio

00:30:43.231 --> 00:30:44.830
is the original sound from that footage.

00:30:45.671 --> 00:30:46.231
But...

00:30:49.550 --> 00:30:50.511
This glass of water.

00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:51.991
Empty just a second ago.

00:30:52.191 --> 00:30:53.070
Full the next second?

00:30:53.511 --> 00:30:54.231
Exactly.

00:30:54.231 --> 00:30:56.271
I had been watching
this video over and over.

00:30:56.550 --> 00:30:58.431
I already realized it was edited.

00:30:58.751 --> 00:31:01.231
But I couldn't figure out
why they cut it

00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:03.191
until this audio was released today.

00:31:03.431 --> 00:31:03.991
I think

00:31:04.390 --> 00:31:06.390
it was to make this audio
match the visuals.

00:31:07.431 --> 00:31:08.991
They seriously think we're pushovers.

00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:10.471
How could they be so malicious?

00:31:10.471 --> 00:31:11.471
Why go to such lengths

00:31:11.471 --> 00:31:12.550
to frame Ms. Bai?

00:31:12.911 --> 00:31:14.191
You rushed back in such a hurry.

00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:15.271
Is your mom okay?

00:31:16.550 --> 00:31:17.751
Mr. Lin is taking care of her.

00:31:20.711 --> 00:31:21.431
I even suspect

00:31:21.431 --> 00:31:23.231
this audio might have been edited too.

00:31:24.431 --> 00:31:24.991
Let me think.

00:31:26.751 --> 00:31:28.070
I think we should get

00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:29.471
a voiceprint identification expert.

00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:34.951
I think Mr. Lin works in that field.

00:31:35.511 --> 00:31:36.630
I'll make a call and ask.

00:31:39.671 --> 00:31:40.911
But I just don't understand.

00:31:41.390 --> 00:31:42.310
He Fan

00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:43.951
is clearly under Xingke's watch.

00:31:44.991 --> 00:31:46.511
Who keeps leaking this information?

00:31:47.031 --> 00:31:47.671
Eddie?

00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:49.630
But why would Eddie

00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:50.951
keep targeting Ms. Bai?

00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:01.751
I'll get you hot water.

00:32:02.431 --> 00:32:03.550
And some snacks, please.

00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:06.760
And also...

00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:13.928
(Bai Xiao, He Fan)

00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:16.680
You okay?

00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:19.870
Mr. Lin said he'd look into it for me.

00:32:20.951 --> 00:32:21.870
I meant, are you okay?

00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:23.431
After going home,

00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:24.911
you seem completely off.

00:32:26.431 --> 00:32:28.231
Is it related to your dad's old case?

00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:33.271
You looked into my dad's case.

00:32:37.787 --> 00:32:41.384
(Ren Ping, Bai Xiao)

00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:44.590
That's what you are really after.

00:32:44.951 --> 00:32:46.431
You suspect your dad's death

00:32:46.431 --> 00:32:47.711
and He Fan's collapse

00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:49.511
both relate to Ms. Bai.

00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:51.110
What else did you find?

00:32:52.231 --> 00:32:53.191
Judging by your look,

00:32:53.191 --> 00:32:53.991
I guessed right.

00:32:54.550 --> 00:32:55.511
Drop it please.

00:32:58.951 --> 00:32:59.790
I need to remind you.

00:33:00.191 --> 00:33:01.431
In your dad's case back then,

00:33:01.471 --> 00:33:02.830
Ms. Bai wasn't the only lawyer.

00:33:03.231 --> 00:33:04.150
She had a partner.

00:33:07.231 --> 00:33:08.191
The Legal Director

00:33:08.191 --> 00:33:09.550
of Xingke Group's rival company.

00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:10.350
(Wang Qing, Asia-Pacific Legal Director)
Wang Qing.

00:33:10.790 --> 00:33:12.070
I checked his background.

00:33:12.191 --> 00:33:14.671
His educational institutions
and prior work experience

00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:17.191
are nearly identical to those
of Ms. Bai's former partner,

00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:18.471
Wang Qin.

00:33:20.671 --> 00:33:22.070
You suspect they're one person?

00:33:23.191 --> 00:33:25.431
So now this Wang Qing
is targeting Ms. Bai

00:33:25.671 --> 00:33:27.711
and bringing up
my father's case in the comments

00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:30.390
because Wang Qin knew Ms. Bai back then.

00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:32.630
Then why is this Lawyer Wang involved?

00:33:35.031 --> 00:33:36.070
You could take the photo

00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:37.231
and ask Ms. Bai tomorrow.

00:33:37.951 --> 00:33:38.911
You'll understand why.

00:33:39.991 --> 00:33:42.031
We're still in the assessment phase.

00:33:42.431 --> 00:33:43.550
You discovered this.

00:33:44.031 --> 00:33:44.711
Why won't you go?

00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:49.288
(Ren Ping)

00:33:52.550 --> 00:33:54.790
You didn't mention it
in front of Guo Xiaoyu.

00:33:56.991 --> 00:33:58.671
You're trying to protect my privacy.

00:33:59.390 --> 00:34:00.790
I don't want you to feel burdened.

00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:03.310
I know your father's case

00:34:03.310 --> 00:34:04.390
means a lot to you.

00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:06.751
But it's from your parents' generation.

00:34:07.711 --> 00:34:09.031
Don't carry this weight with you.

00:34:09.791 --> 00:34:11.630
I know you and your father were close.

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:13.391
You can't let it go

00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:15.871
and want to shoulder
this responsibility.

00:34:16.911 --> 00:34:17.951
But I want to tell you.

00:34:19.991 --> 00:34:22.110
While love can empower you,

00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:24.710
in some situations,

00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:27.750
it can become chains that hold you back.

00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:30.630
If he knew you carried

00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:32.550
this heavy burden every single day,

00:34:33.951 --> 00:34:35.070
he would feel heartbroken.

00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:46.550
It's Mr. Lin.

00:34:48.311 --> 00:34:50.070
He says this audio clip is fake.

00:34:50.391 --> 00:34:51.391
Generated by AI.

00:34:52.511 --> 00:34:54.110
I'll compile it and report to Ms. Bai.

00:34:57.416 --> 00:34:59.590
(Wang Qing's Profile)
The opposing company's lawyer.

00:34:59.590 --> 00:35:00.391
Wang Qing.

00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:01.831
Jiang Chen and I suspect

00:35:01.951 --> 00:35:03.951
that the leaker wasn't Eddie,

00:35:04.031 --> 00:35:04.550
but him.

00:35:04.831 --> 00:35:06.871
Or that he conspired with Eddie.

00:35:08.590 --> 00:35:09.511
Explain your reasoning.

00:35:10.070 --> 00:35:11.550
This theory hinges on one premise.

00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:12.710
That lawyer Wang,

00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:14.550
who worked with you on my father's case,

00:35:14.590 --> 00:35:15.951
and this Wang Qing are one person.

00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:17.750
Ms. Bai, is it him?

00:35:18.831 --> 00:35:19.400
Yes.

00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:21.670
He changed his name after I resigned.

00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:22.710
That's it.

00:35:23.351 --> 00:35:25.710
I've been reviewing the comments.

00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:27.791
Many accounts were newly created.

00:35:28.391 --> 00:35:30.031
All the comments accuse you

00:35:30.991 --> 00:35:33.471
of driving someone
to death in my father's case.

00:35:34.750 --> 00:35:35.791
I suspect

00:35:35.791 --> 00:35:37.550
they are hired
by an insider to manipulate

00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:38.471
public opinion.

00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:42.871
I'll carefully consider your findings.

00:35:48.951 --> 00:35:50.431
I have more to tell you.

00:35:53.871 --> 00:35:54.871
I want to apologize.

00:35:58.150 --> 00:35:59.351
Why apologize to me?

00:35:59.831 --> 00:36:01.230
My previous questions were

00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:02.190
highly unprofessional.

00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:05.991
First, I questioned your professional
integrity. It's disrespectful.

00:36:06.351 --> 00:36:07.311
Second, as someone

00:36:07.311 --> 00:36:08.590
pursuing this profession,

00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:10.110
I know public perception

00:36:10.110 --> 00:36:11.110
is often misguided.

00:36:11.431 --> 00:36:13.070
But I posed those very questions to you,

00:36:14.070 --> 00:36:15.391
disrespecting myself.

00:36:16.750 --> 00:36:17.831
I hope you'll forgive me.

00:36:19.871 --> 00:36:20.511
It's fine.

00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:23.190
I don't care what you think,

00:36:24.070 --> 00:36:26.031
nor will it affect
my evaluation of your work.

00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:29.670
How's your mother's recovery?

00:36:31.311 --> 00:36:32.031
Progressing well.

00:36:33.471 --> 00:36:35.431
Thanks to your help arranging wards.

00:36:37.550 --> 00:36:38.184
Good to hear.

00:36:38.791 --> 00:36:39.368
That's all.

00:36:40.031 --> 00:36:40.550
Go to work.

00:37:02.952 --> 00:37:04.808
(Yan Fei)

00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:07.272
Hello.

00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:08.808
Go ahead.

00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:11.710
Zhang Xiaomei just contacted Yan Fei

00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:12.991
and sent her a photo.

00:37:12.991 --> 00:37:13.670
Everyone, look.

00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:14.792
(Zhang Xiaomei's Selfie)

00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:17.911
This was taken by Zhang Xiaomei
days before Yan Da's accident

00:37:17.911 --> 00:37:19.831
while accompanying him abroad.

00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:21.670
The notebook on the table appears

00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:23.431
to be Xingke's commemorative edition.

00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:25.110
On our first day here,

00:37:25.110 --> 00:37:26.871
didn't Yan Fei distribute
these to everyone?

00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:28.630
Yes, this exact design.

00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:31.550
But the notebook in the photo

00:37:31.590 --> 00:37:33.911
has yellow and white alternating pages.

00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:34.670
You're right.

00:37:34.984 --> 00:37:35.871
Notice here.

00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:38.431
This suggests someone
secretly swapped it.

00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:40.110
The evidence held by local police

00:37:40.110 --> 00:37:41.670
is pale yellow inner pages.

00:37:41.791 --> 00:37:43.991
Someone inside
must have slipped in secretly

00:37:43.991 --> 00:37:45.831
and replaced this pure white notebook

00:37:45.831 --> 00:37:46.871
with a white-yellow one.

00:37:46.871 --> 00:37:47.511
This way,

00:37:47.511 --> 00:37:49.511
they could mix in
those pale yellow inner pages

00:37:49.511 --> 00:37:50.088
as evidence.

00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:56.392
(Wang Qing)

00:37:57.511 --> 00:37:58.190
Tian, Zhou.

00:37:58.431 --> 00:38:00.150
Please assign the remaining tasks.

00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:06.351
Ms. Tian.

00:38:06.351 --> 00:38:08.951
Could it be Eddie
who ordered He Fan to do it?

00:38:10.110 --> 00:38:11.391
I heard from Ms. Bai

00:38:11.590 --> 00:38:13.031
that Yan Fei spoke with He Fan.

00:38:13.311 --> 00:38:14.670
He Fan refused to admit anything.

00:38:14.991 --> 00:38:16.911
She just said Ms. Bai

00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:18.431
pushed her

00:38:18.590 --> 00:38:19.351
into anxiety.

00:38:19.791 --> 00:38:20.871
How can she be like this?

00:38:21.831 --> 00:38:23.110
Fei must feel so frustrated.

00:38:44.431 --> 00:38:45.032
Still busy?

00:38:45.471 --> 00:38:46.710
I just met Zhang Xiaomei.

00:38:46.831 --> 00:38:47.991
We talked again.

00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:49.550
She did post

00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:51.311
that photo on social media,

00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:53.991
but later, after Yan Da
lost contact with her,

00:38:54.311 --> 00:38:55.630
she deleted that photo.

00:38:56.190 --> 00:38:57.911
Eddie probably saw it.

00:38:58.031 --> 00:38:59.431
He kept egging her on to go abroad

00:38:59.710 --> 00:39:00.710
and kept her from me.

00:39:04.351 --> 00:39:06.511
I might go to Hangzhou this weekend.

00:39:07.590 --> 00:39:08.200
Oh?

00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:10.351
It's Hangzhou's most beautiful season.

00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:11.391
Business trip?

00:39:13.871 --> 00:39:14.391
Sort of.

00:39:19.471 --> 00:39:19.976
Okay.

00:39:22.431 --> 00:39:23.230
Good luck.

00:39:24.471 --> 00:39:25.160
Same to you.

(your flight from Beijing to Hangzhou)

00:40:08.351 --> 00:40:10.311
You had Yan Fei go
to talk to He Fan, didn't you?

00:40:11.048 --> 00:40:11.710
That way,

00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:13.311
He Fan would pass the message to them.

00:40:14.351 --> 00:40:15.230
You know me well.

00:40:16.471 --> 00:40:18.351
My old friend finally contacted me.

00:40:18.791 --> 00:40:21.031
Wang couldn't hold back anymore.
What did he say?

00:40:21.951 --> 00:40:22.951
A five-minute call.

00:40:22.951 --> 00:40:24.351
He spent four-thirty on nostalgia,

00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:26.710
only to casually mention
at the very end,

00:40:27.150 --> 00:40:28.590
"We've been in this field so long.

00:40:28.951 --> 00:40:30.630
Work matters are never easy.

00:40:31.110 --> 00:40:33.630
You and I both know how it is."

00:40:34.031 --> 00:40:35.871
Then he chuckled and hung up.

00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:38.670
How cunning.

00:40:40.270 --> 00:40:41.791
He did this to avoid leaving evidence.

00:40:42.471 --> 00:40:43.311
He never handles

00:40:44.110 --> 00:40:44.991
the leaks personally.

00:40:46.031 --> 00:40:47.150
I know him.

00:40:47.871 --> 00:40:48.951
He and Eddie

00:40:48.951 --> 00:40:50.431
were likely ordered by their company.

00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:51.511
I represent Xingke,

00:40:52.070 --> 00:40:53.791
so they slander and defame me

00:40:53.791 --> 00:40:54.750
to make me step down

00:40:54.951 --> 00:40:56.590
and stall Yan Da.

00:40:57.190 --> 00:40:58.431
And they can use it as a reason

00:40:58.630 --> 00:41:00.911
to fire Eddie,
who never delivers results.

00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:02.070
So usually,

00:41:02.391 --> 00:41:04.190
they provoke and egg Eddie on.

00:41:04.991 --> 00:41:05.630
Makes sense.

00:41:06.351 --> 00:41:07.431
You're so clever.

00:41:07.710 --> 00:41:09.471
Because this is his favorite tactic.

00:41:10.070 --> 00:41:11.031
Even now, he is

00:41:11.031 --> 00:41:12.791
the legal head
of a famous overseas company.

00:41:13.110 --> 00:41:14.791
Some things never change.

00:41:15.031 --> 00:41:16.590
Just like he knows me well too.

00:41:16.871 --> 00:41:18.110
So his every exposure of me

00:41:18.590 --> 00:41:20.311
mixes truth and lies.

00:41:27.190 --> 00:41:28.150
Really, offend anyone

00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:29.070
but a lawyer.

00:41:29.070 --> 00:41:29.871
They're ruthless.

00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:32.750
I'm not. I'm a good person.

00:41:33.831 --> 00:41:35.110
But the worst off now is Eddie.

00:41:35.528 --> 00:41:36.190
He's a worker

00:41:36.190 --> 00:41:37.791
who can be sacrificed anytime.

00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:40.270
I've seen young people

00:41:40.270 --> 00:41:41.471
venting on social media,

00:41:41.471 --> 00:41:43.351
saying they work hard every day

00:41:43.630 --> 00:41:44.750
with no time, no friends,

00:41:44.831 --> 00:41:45.951
no romance, no health.

00:41:46.311 --> 00:41:47.550
Half their salary goes to rent,

00:41:47.590 --> 00:41:48.871
the other half to commuting.

00:41:49.471 --> 00:41:50.951
After barely making it past 30,

00:41:51.351 --> 00:41:53.270
the company's layoff awaits.

00:41:54.070 --> 00:41:56.110
Honestly, though they
forgot to block me,

00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:57.070
it really

00:41:57.471 --> 00:41:58.590
resonated with me.

00:41:58.710 --> 00:42:00.110
Haven't we all endured this?

00:42:00.351 --> 00:42:00.968
Yes.

00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:02.590
Wang Qing must be the same.

00:42:03.391 --> 00:42:04.230
He smeared me,

00:42:04.831 --> 00:42:06.791
probably hoping
we'd stop after finding Eddie

00:42:06.871 --> 00:42:07.991
and not investigate him.

00:42:08.511 --> 00:42:09.911
After years of working for capital,

00:42:09.911 --> 00:42:10.911
he knows very well

00:42:10.911 --> 00:42:12.110
if something goes wrong,

00:42:12.391 --> 00:42:13.670
a big overseas company like this

00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:14.831
would never protect him.

00:42:15.471 --> 00:42:16.351
Most likely,

00:42:16.471 --> 00:42:18.230
they'd fire him just like Eddie.
