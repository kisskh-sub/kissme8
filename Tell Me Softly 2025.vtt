TELL ME
SOFTLY

01:56.000 --> 01:57.500
<i>We can, girls!</i>

02:00.291 --> 02:02.166
<i>Kami, you're the best!</i>

02:50.083 --> 02:53.541
What kind of sick mind would think of
starting the school year on a Friday?

02:53.625 --> 02:55.333
It's to make you forget about summer.

02:55.416 --> 02:56.708
Come on, get up.

02:57.791 --> 02:58.708
And put this on.

03:00.250 --> 03:01.916
It's a little too much, isn't it?

03:02.416 --> 03:03.875
Don't make me repeat myself.

03:24.375 --> 03:25.500
Is something the matter?

03:26.500 --> 03:29.416
Is someone moving into the house
across the street?

03:41.708 --> 03:44.166
Carlos, we'll drop your sister off
and then I'll drive you.

03:50.083 --> 03:51.250
I'll drop you off here.

03:51.333 --> 03:52.291
Great.

03:53.666 --> 03:54.541
Thanks, Dad.

03:54.625 --> 03:56.125
- Have a nice day.
- Bye.

03:56.208 --> 03:57.208
- Bye.
- Bye.

03:57.291 --> 03:59.583
Hey, my phone. Smarty-pants.

03:59.666 --> 04:01.125
- See you.
- Bye.

04:01.208 --> 04:02.041
Bye.

04:17.458 --> 04:19.916
Hey, who is this girl?

04:21.083 --> 04:22.250
How are you girls doing?

04:22.333 --> 04:23.625
You look great!

04:23.708 --> 04:25.041
- Do you like it?
- I love it.

04:25.125 --> 04:26.500
- How are you?
- Bye, girls!

04:26.583 --> 04:27.916
See you later.

04:31.291 --> 04:33.083
I'll wear it, and that's it, right?

04:33.875 --> 04:35.916
- What will you two be wearing?
- Baby.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.458
- No idea.
- I don't know.

04:37.541 --> 04:38.500
Baby.

04:42.125 --> 04:43.250
Hi.

04:44.166 --> 04:45.208
Hi.

04:45.291 --> 04:46.583
Aren't you gonna kiss me?

04:52.416 --> 04:53.833
You're pulling away from me?

04:53.916 --> 04:55.166
She pulled away from you!

04:55.583 --> 04:57.250
Unbelievable, Kami.

04:57.333 --> 05:00.083
From your own boyfriend.
Here, in front of everyone.

05:00.166 --> 05:01.833
I'm sorry, Dani.

05:01.916 --> 05:04.083
I just got nervous with everyone here.

05:04.166 --> 05:05.875
Since when are you embarrassed of me?

05:05.958 --> 05:08.250
Don't start turning this around, please.

05:08.333 --> 05:10.208
That's why you've left me
on read all summer.

05:10.291 --> 05:12.708
- What are you talking about?
- Right? You're over me.

05:12.791 --> 05:14.291
Is that it or did you cheat on me?

05:14.375 --> 05:16.625
Excuse me? Cata, stop it.

05:17.208 --> 05:19.625
Don't worry. Just act natural,
like I'm not here.

05:19.708 --> 05:21.125
Stop recording me, please.

05:21.875 --> 05:23.458
Let's talk somewhere else.

05:23.541 --> 05:26.333
Now you want to talk.
What about when it's me who wants to?

05:26.416 --> 05:28.125
Dani, not in front of everyone.

05:36.666 --> 05:37.958
Dani, let's go somewhere else.

05:38.041 --> 05:40.416
No. This place
is going to be empty for a while.

05:42.208 --> 05:44.333
So, what's wrong with you?

05:45.541 --> 05:46.958
I've had a difficult summer.

05:47.500 --> 05:48.500
Difficult?

05:49.416 --> 05:50.250
Tell me, why?

05:52.458 --> 05:54.583
Dani. Why are you asking
if you don't give a damn?

05:55.166 --> 05:56.333
I'm listening. Tell me.

05:56.416 --> 05:57.750
Stop it, please!

05:59.125 --> 06:01.791
Kami, you see it, right?
You have a problem with me.

06:01.875 --> 06:02.958
Will you let me talk?

06:03.041 --> 06:04.083
- Me?
- Yes.

06:04.166 --> 06:05.625
I'm always ready to talk.

06:05.708 --> 06:06.958
And you always ignore me.

06:07.041 --> 06:07.875
- What?
- Yeah.

06:07.958 --> 06:10.708
- I do my best, but it's not working.
- I'm done. Seriously.

06:10.791 --> 06:12.125
- No. Calm down.
- I'm out of here.

06:12.208 --> 06:13.375
- I am calm.
- No. Kami.

06:13.458 --> 06:14.958
- Then let me talk. Dani!
- Kami.

06:15.041 --> 06:17.208
- Stop, please.
- She told you to leave her alone.

06:19.041 --> 06:20.416
She said she wants to go.

06:29.666 --> 06:30.583
Who is this guy?

06:34.500 --> 06:36.375
Taylor. Nice to meet you.

06:38.666 --> 06:40.541
Why does he have that thing you have?

06:42.041 --> 06:43.166
Long story.

06:44.958 --> 06:46.625
Is he the guy you hooked up with?

06:47.625 --> 06:49.250
I didn't hook up with anyone.

06:49.333 --> 06:50.541
I didn't cheat on you.

06:50.625 --> 06:53.041
Cheating? Is he your boyfriend?

06:53.125 --> 06:54.958
Tay, shut up, please.

06:55.041 --> 06:56.458
Yeah, bro, get dressed and scram.

07:01.291 --> 07:03.833
No. Not until I see Kami go.

07:04.375 --> 07:06.041
- Alone.
- You're asking for it.

07:06.125 --> 07:06.958
Dani, stop it!

07:07.875 --> 07:10.625
- You stand up for your little crush.
- He's not my crush!

07:10.708 --> 07:12.208
Damn it, Dani, I'm sick of this!

07:12.750 --> 07:14.625
I don't want to be with you anymore.

07:15.291 --> 07:17.916
- What are you saying?
- That's what's wrong with me.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.791
I'm sick of this.
I want you to leave me alone.

07:27.291 --> 07:28.500
What a loser.

07:35.958 --> 07:38.875
There's nothing between me and Kami.
We've known each other forever.

07:43.750 --> 07:45.333
<i>...seven, eight!</i>

07:45.416 --> 07:49.166
One, two, three, four, five,

07:49.250 --> 07:50.458
six!

07:50.541 --> 07:51.833
Come on, girls!

07:51.916 --> 07:53.416
It's 5:00 p.m., I want to go home.

07:53.500 --> 07:56.166
- Guys, don't stop!
- Hands. Do you remember?

07:56.250 --> 07:57.375
No. Let's see.

07:57.916 --> 07:59.166
- Come on. Yes, please.
- There.

08:04.583 --> 08:06.000
Nice one!

08:08.625 --> 08:10.291
Keep going, guys!

08:10.375 --> 08:11.375
Come on!

08:12.666 --> 08:14.625
- What's up? I'm Taylor.
- Arón.

08:14.708 --> 08:15.583
Nice to meet you.

08:15.666 --> 08:17.666
Kami. Damn it. Focus.

08:18.458 --> 08:19.916
Yeah, I'm sorry.

08:21.041 --> 08:21.958
Sorry.

08:25.791 --> 08:26.625
Honey,

08:26.708 --> 08:29.166
are you really
willing to ruin our rehearsal

08:29.250 --> 08:31.375
just so the new guy will notice you?

08:35.208 --> 08:36.083
Okay.

08:37.083 --> 08:37.916
I'm done.

08:39.166 --> 08:40.041
- Okay.
- Good.

08:43.041 --> 08:43.875
Girls!

08:43.958 --> 08:46.000
Five-minute break.

08:46.083 --> 08:48.916
We're not leaving today
until we get it perfect.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.875
Let's thank Kamila for that!

08:52.666 --> 08:54.208
Nice steal, brother! Great!

08:56.583 --> 09:00.083
Look how handsome my lions are!

09:00.166 --> 09:02.541
You're so handsome!

09:03.250 --> 09:06.500
All right, so, this year
I'm going to have an assistant coach

09:06.583 --> 09:08.333
to help us prepare
for the fall tournament.

09:08.416 --> 09:09.750
Here he is.

09:13.208 --> 09:14.291
I'm Thiago.

09:15.666 --> 09:16.833
What's up?

09:20.500 --> 09:22.291
Thiago, Taylor...

09:23.375 --> 09:24.416
Shit.

09:27.666 --> 09:29.375
The Di Bianco brothers.

09:29.458 --> 09:31.125
No fucking way. They're back.

09:32.041 --> 09:34.916
Come on, let's go!

09:36.416 --> 09:38.083
They look great, don't they?

09:39.208 --> 09:41.500
One, two, three,

09:41.583 --> 09:43.750
- four, five, six...
- Lions, let's go!

09:43.833 --> 09:45.291
...seven, eight!

09:45.375 --> 09:47.041
One, two, three...

09:47.125 --> 09:49.083
<i>I'm catching you. Don't fall behind.</i>

09:49.166 --> 09:50.291
Run faster.

09:51.875 --> 09:55.708
7 YEARS EARLIER

10:15.750 --> 10:16.833
Okay. One to nothing.

10:16.916 --> 10:19.041
I win every time. Forget what I said.

10:19.125 --> 10:21.291
Kam, Tay, come here!

10:21.375 --> 10:22.625
It's important!

10:22.708 --> 10:23.916
Coming!

10:34.750 --> 10:36.083
What's that for?

10:36.750 --> 10:37.958
Trust me.

10:39.666 --> 10:41.000
It's dangerous.

10:51.958 --> 10:52.958
Give me your hand.

11:13.375 --> 11:15.916
This means that our friendship is forever.

11:19.583 --> 11:21.375
Kami, do you dare?

11:21.916 --> 11:23.208
Kami, please.

11:59.708 --> 12:02.375
They left like ten years ago, right?

12:03.250 --> 12:04.250
Seven.

12:04.333 --> 12:05.916
Just like that, out of nowhere.

12:07.666 --> 12:08.916
Why did they leave?

12:11.250 --> 12:12.916
You were always with them.

12:13.625 --> 12:14.625
I remember that.

12:17.791 --> 12:19.041
Did you like one of them?

12:20.708 --> 12:22.625
We were kids, Cata.

12:27.375 --> 12:28.583
You liked both of them.

12:29.333 --> 12:30.625
That's enough, okay?

12:31.958 --> 12:33.291
Kami, honey,

12:33.375 --> 12:35.916
you were looking at them
like you used to hook up with both--

12:36.000 --> 12:36.875
Dude, will you stop?

12:36.958 --> 12:38.708
You're always messing with her.

12:39.416 --> 12:40.541
Bam, bam, bam.

12:51.291 --> 12:52.791
Girls, where's my phone?

12:55.083 --> 12:57.875
- Can we tell my brother about the party?
- Yeah.

12:58.750 --> 12:59.916
Thiago!

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
Arón is throwing
an end-of-summer party tonight.

13:03.083 --> 13:04.291
Are you coming?

13:04.375 --> 13:06.083
Guys, I'm your coach.

13:06.166 --> 13:07.750
That's right. Sorry.

13:07.833 --> 13:09.250
Are you coming, Coach?

13:10.958 --> 13:12.250
Tell me, who is going?

13:12.333 --> 13:13.958
Well, everyone's invited, right?

13:14.041 --> 13:15.958
Everyone is coming, trust me.

13:16.041 --> 13:17.708
And who is everyone?

13:17.791 --> 13:19.458
The guys on the team.

13:19.541 --> 13:21.083
And the girls too, of course.

13:24.125 --> 13:26.125
Are you guys thinking
of any girl in particular?

13:26.708 --> 13:27.833
No, just in general.

13:28.625 --> 13:29.958
But you could get fired.

13:30.041 --> 13:32.333
I just wanted to know
if other teachers will be there.

13:32.416 --> 13:34.000
You know you're not a teacher, right?

13:34.083 --> 13:36.250
- You're the coach's assistant.
- Assistant coach.

13:36.333 --> 13:37.708
Whatever. Are you coming or not?

13:40.916 --> 13:43.041
No, I shouldn't. Thank you.

13:43.125 --> 13:45.666
When you're done being full of yourself
and decide to come,

13:45.750 --> 13:47.166
here's the address.

13:48.166 --> 13:49.416
All right. See you there.

13:51.708 --> 13:52.750
- Bye.
- Coach.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.750
DANI
TEXT MESSAGE

14:22.833 --> 14:23.750
Kamila.

14:33.791 --> 14:35.208
I think this is yours.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.583
You were looking for it, right?

14:42.708 --> 14:43.625
"Kamila"?

14:45.708 --> 14:47.208
Did you change your name?

14:49.333 --> 14:50.750
How have you been, Thiago?

14:56.416 --> 14:57.375
Fine. You?

14:58.083 --> 14:59.916
Aren't you going to give me a hug?

15:03.958 --> 15:06.583
Is it yours or should I take it
to the principal's office?

15:13.041 --> 15:14.083
Thiago.

15:15.583 --> 15:16.708
Where was it?

15:22.125 --> 15:23.041
On the bench.

15:24.041 --> 15:25.458
You didn't take it, did you?

15:25.958 --> 15:26.833
What did you say?

15:26.916 --> 15:28.250
I'm asking if you took it.

15:28.333 --> 15:30.541
To go through it
and make me come ask for it.

15:30.625 --> 15:31.541
Typical of you.

15:33.458 --> 15:34.583
Typical of me?

15:35.875 --> 15:37.208
You don't know me anymore.

15:39.125 --> 15:42.375
If word gets out that the new coach
is stealing girls' cell phones

15:42.458 --> 15:44.291
to do God knows what,

15:44.750 --> 15:46.666
this'll be the shortest gig of your life.

15:50.416 --> 15:51.375
What are you doing?

15:51.458 --> 15:53.541
I don't know if it's yours.
I was too hasty.

15:53.625 --> 15:55.041
It's mine. Give it to me.

15:55.125 --> 15:56.583
The spoiled brat, making demands.

15:56.666 --> 15:57.583
Excuse me?

16:03.000 --> 16:04.791
You're still the same.

16:08.625 --> 16:10.958
Ask for it at the principal's office
on Monday.

16:11.041 --> 16:12.125
If it's really yours.

16:12.208 --> 16:14.250
I need it this weekend, Thiago!

16:49.791 --> 16:52.500
Are you going to spy on them
like when you were little?

17:03.375 --> 17:05.083
They still make you cry.

17:06.458 --> 17:07.583
It's not my fault.

17:07.666 --> 17:08.916
Of course it is, dear.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.791
It's up to you
if you let them affect your life or not.

17:11.875 --> 17:13.291
As if it were that easy.

17:13.375 --> 17:14.625
Just stay away from them.

17:14.708 --> 17:17.708
Don't talk to them,
don't look at them, don't say hello.

17:18.833 --> 17:20.166
They don't exist.

17:25.416 --> 17:28.791
- I'm serious, you look great.
- Thank you. So do you.

17:35.750 --> 17:36.708
You look beautiful.

17:38.625 --> 17:39.708
What are you doing here?

17:40.791 --> 17:43.333
Your mother told me to pick you up
to go to Arón's party.

17:44.375 --> 17:45.541
Come on, darling.

17:45.625 --> 17:48.583
Wait for her outside.
I need to help her with her dress.

17:48.666 --> 17:49.791
All right?

17:52.000 --> 17:52.875
Thank you.

17:57.666 --> 17:59.833
He called me
because you won't answer his calls.

17:59.916 --> 18:01.500
I forgot my phone at school.

18:01.583 --> 18:03.541
You? You forgot your phone?

18:03.625 --> 18:06.166
- It's the first thing you check.
- Why did he call you?

18:07.375 --> 18:09.833
- Dani and I have a great relationship.
- Excuse me?

18:11.583 --> 18:15.000
He told me you broke up with him
after you saw Taylor Di Bianco.

18:15.500 --> 18:16.416
What?

18:17.583 --> 18:19.250
- He told you--
- Relax.

18:19.666 --> 18:21.000
I told him not to worry.

18:21.083 --> 18:23.958
That you must've been nervous
because it was the first day of school.

18:24.458 --> 18:26.958
You didn't break with him
because of the Di Biancos, did you?

18:27.041 --> 18:28.083
That'd be the last straw.

18:28.166 --> 18:30.333
I've been wanting
to break up with him all summer.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
Why?

18:33.291 --> 18:35.041
Why? Dani is very affectionate.

18:35.541 --> 18:38.083
- Polite, handsome, from a good family...
- And very toxic.

18:39.416 --> 18:40.458
Here we go again.

18:41.041 --> 18:42.333
Everything is toxic nowadays.

18:42.416 --> 18:45.583
We're all toxic.
Anything anyone says is toxic.

18:47.083 --> 18:49.000
Okay, hear me out.

18:51.208 --> 18:52.625
Dani is not perfect.

18:53.291 --> 18:54.791
Neither are you.

18:54.875 --> 18:57.666
But he has great qualities
that outweigh the less desirable ones.

19:01.958 --> 19:03.000
Kam!

19:03.583 --> 19:04.958
Kam, wait up!

19:09.541 --> 19:11.208
I'm not a coward.

19:11.291 --> 19:12.208
I know.

19:54.416 --> 19:56.083
I don't want to go to college just yet.

19:56.166 --> 20:00.875
I want to take a year off to find myself,
to figure out who I am emotionally.

20:00.958 --> 20:04.291
I also want to sign up for mermaid school,
because I identify as a mermaid.

20:04.375 --> 20:07.416
In fact, there's
a really cool school in Barcelona

20:07.500 --> 20:09.791
that has intensive weekend courses

20:09.875 --> 20:12.208
that include mermaid tail swimming,

20:12.291 --> 20:15.291
floating and resting, freediving...

20:35.416 --> 20:36.791
Dani! What's up?

20:36.875 --> 20:38.458
- What's up, bro?
- Hey!

20:39.458 --> 20:40.541
Come down!

20:46.250 --> 20:48.250
Thank you, Arón! One more year!

20:48.333 --> 20:50.500
Let's go!

21:06.250 --> 21:07.458
I'm not telling you.

21:07.541 --> 21:09.291
- Cheers, girls.
- Cheers.

21:10.250 --> 21:11.208
It's strong, huh?

21:12.666 --> 21:15.666
Okay, the big question.
Are you back together?

21:15.750 --> 21:17.458
No, we're not back together.

21:17.541 --> 21:19.500
I broke up with him all of a sudden

21:19.583 --> 21:21.000
because I was on edge.

21:21.083 --> 21:23.916
I normally like to
talk things over, calmly.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.250
Taylor is looking at you.

21:29.125 --> 21:31.583
He's not looking at her.
He's looking at us.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.958
Arón! Can I have some, please?

21:41.916 --> 21:44.500
You don't ask for it.
You wait until it's your turn.

21:44.958 --> 21:45.916
Please.

21:48.125 --> 21:49.208
Have you ever smoked?

21:50.291 --> 21:51.166
Of course.

21:56.291 --> 21:57.500
Come on, Kami, come here.

21:57.583 --> 21:59.041
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

21:59.125 --> 22:00.708
- Is your drink there?
- I'm fine. Yes.

22:00.791 --> 22:02.791
- Are you sure? Drink.
- I'm fine, Dani.

22:02.875 --> 22:03.958
I'm fine.

22:07.541 --> 22:08.958
Who's that nerd with Cata?

22:10.750 --> 22:13.250
That's her half-brother.
He lives here now.

22:13.333 --> 22:15.875
Cata! Introduce us.

22:18.791 --> 22:19.666
Hi.

22:19.750 --> 22:21.916
Everyone, this is Julián.

22:22.833 --> 22:24.458
Juli, this is everyone.

22:24.541 --> 22:25.583
Jules.

22:25.666 --> 22:27.458
- Hello.
- What's up, Julián?

22:27.541 --> 22:28.625
- Hey.
- Nice to meet you.

22:28.708 --> 22:29.583
How are you?

22:29.666 --> 22:31.833
- All right, I'll leave him here with you.
- Hi.

22:31.916 --> 22:32.875
I need a drink.

22:33.750 --> 22:35.625
- Where's the booze?
- Over there.

22:35.708 --> 22:36.916
- Hey.
- Hi.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.250
How are you? You're Kamila, right?

22:39.333 --> 22:40.250
Yeah.

22:40.333 --> 22:41.791
I follow you on social media.

22:43.041 --> 22:44.250
You don't follow me?

22:45.000 --> 22:47.958
No. Because I don't know you.

22:48.041 --> 22:51.791
It's fine. You have a ton of followers,
like 100,000 or...

22:51.875 --> 22:53.208
123,000.

22:55.208 --> 22:58.333
Tell me your username later
and I'll follow you, all right?

22:59.208 --> 23:00.083
All right.

23:02.375 --> 23:04.208
- Hey.
- Let's go shoot some hoops.

23:07.041 --> 23:07.875
Hey.

23:07.958 --> 23:09.750
- You have to wait.
- What are you doing?

23:09.833 --> 23:11.625
You're gonna get so stoned.

23:15.041 --> 23:16.666
Kami. Where are you going?

23:19.666 --> 23:21.416
- It's been two weeks...
- Hi.

23:22.500 --> 23:24.333
It's a very short time, but...

23:24.875 --> 23:26.166
I mean, we've just...

23:26.250 --> 23:28.250
Stop talking so much.

23:40.166 --> 23:41.333
What's with the smile?

23:43.083 --> 23:44.583
What's going on? Are you high?

23:45.791 --> 23:46.916
I'm stoned.

23:47.291 --> 23:49.833
Oh. So you're smiling
because of the joint.

23:51.083 --> 23:53.416
No. It's because of you.

23:57.375 --> 23:58.208
May I?

24:02.458 --> 24:03.958
Are you challenging me?

24:05.583 --> 24:07.208
I'm about to kick your ass.

24:09.833 --> 24:10.958
Whenever you're ready.

24:11.583 --> 24:13.416
Go easy on her. She's just a chick.

24:13.500 --> 24:15.166
You don't know her.

24:35.041 --> 24:35.958
Throw it!

24:38.000 --> 24:39.125
Up to four.

24:39.208 --> 24:40.916
Kami and Taylor are playing, come on!

24:41.958 --> 24:43.958
Kami, you're the best!

24:45.833 --> 24:47.541
Thrash him!

24:49.958 --> 24:50.916
One-nil!

24:57.541 --> 24:58.791
Go, Taylor!

25:04.041 --> 25:05.041
Come on!

25:16.833 --> 25:17.875
2-1!

25:27.958 --> 25:29.416
Come on, crush her!

25:42.750 --> 25:44.041
3-2, come on!

25:49.000 --> 25:50.208
Yeah, come on!

25:52.583 --> 25:53.875
Come on!

26:05.083 --> 26:06.541
3-3!

26:07.500 --> 26:08.666
Kami!

26:21.958 --> 26:23.541
Dude, come on.

26:35.083 --> 26:36.416
You still play like a pro.

26:38.666 --> 26:40.708
I hadn't played with anybody in ages.

26:41.500 --> 26:43.166
I don't even know how long.

26:44.083 --> 26:45.583
I missed it.

26:48.333 --> 26:50.333
And I missed you, Tay.

26:50.416 --> 26:51.625
I missed you too, Kami.

26:55.250 --> 26:56.291
I'm sorry.

26:57.541 --> 26:58.500
For what?

26:58.583 --> 27:00.958
Hey, I'm not a sore loser.
Don't be so cocky.

27:01.041 --> 27:02.458
I'm not talking about basketball.

27:02.541 --> 27:05.916
- Now's not the time to talk about that.
- But we should talk one day.

27:06.000 --> 27:06.833
Or not.

27:10.583 --> 27:13.083
Did you come back
to burn my house down with me inside?

27:13.166 --> 27:14.458
What are you talking about?

27:14.541 --> 27:16.458
No, we're back because...

27:17.875 --> 27:19.125
My mom missed her home.

27:19.208 --> 27:22.125
Well, actually, I did too.

27:24.500 --> 27:25.458
What about Thiago?

27:30.458 --> 27:32.250
Have you ever hated me as much as him?

27:32.333 --> 27:33.333
Never.

27:33.708 --> 27:34.625
Kamila.

27:54.458 --> 27:56.250
- You good?
- Come on, a shot!

28:06.125 --> 28:07.291
Thiago.

28:08.416 --> 28:09.625
Do you remember me?

28:13.000 --> 28:14.458
Cata, isn't it?

28:14.541 --> 28:15.541
That's right.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.291
How about two kisses?

28:19.958 --> 28:20.833
Sure.

28:29.583 --> 28:31.666
Wanna go somewhere more private?

29:21.666 --> 29:22.833
Let me look at you.

29:24.833 --> 29:25.833
We shouldn't.

29:25.916 --> 29:27.291
I just want to take a look.

29:35.916 --> 29:36.958
Damn.

29:55.875 --> 29:57.375
What the hell are you doing, Thiago?

29:57.458 --> 29:58.541
Shit.

29:59.541 --> 30:01.500
- Get lost.
- Cata, get out of here, please.

30:02.083 --> 30:03.791
Your brother is telling you to get lost.

30:03.875 --> 30:06.791
- You're coming with me. Let's go.
- Here's what we'll do.

30:07.583 --> 30:09.833
You go with Kamila and leave me alone.

30:09.916 --> 30:13.625
Dude, don't screw up. Please.

30:14.458 --> 30:16.041
Excuse me?

30:16.125 --> 30:18.000
What do you mean, "screw up," asshole?

30:18.083 --> 30:19.708
Damn. Just ignore him.

30:21.541 --> 30:22.541
Shit.

30:29.625 --> 30:31.708
- Cata's a student, man.
- Nothing happened.

30:31.791 --> 30:33.666
Does Kami get to your head that much?

30:35.000 --> 30:36.125
Talk to me.

30:43.166 --> 30:44.583
You knew you'd run into her.

30:44.666 --> 30:46.166
And you knew we'd be friends again.

30:46.625 --> 30:49.875
I can't pretend that nothing happened.
Like you're doing.

30:49.958 --> 30:52.416
Will you ever stop blaming her
for all our misfortunes?

30:52.500 --> 30:53.500
It's her fault.

30:53.583 --> 30:56.666
Everything that happened
and all those shitty years afterwards.

30:56.750 --> 30:58.000
It's all her fault.

31:00.208 --> 31:02.625
Why can't we try to get back
what the three of us had?

31:06.000 --> 31:08.416
- What did we have?
- What do you mean?

31:11.875 --> 31:13.166
There was nothing between us.

31:13.875 --> 31:15.625
Only kids' nonsense.

31:15.708 --> 31:17.958
What about this?
Wasn't this supposed to be for life?

31:22.166 --> 31:23.208
Shit!

31:23.291 --> 31:25.166
- Kami, where are you going?
- What do you care?

31:25.250 --> 31:26.375
- Home.
- Alone?

31:26.458 --> 31:28.333
- Let her go.
- I don't like her walking alone.

31:28.416 --> 31:30.916
What the hell could happen to her
in this shithole?

31:31.000 --> 31:32.583
A seagull might shit on her?

31:32.666 --> 31:33.583
Go home.

31:34.416 --> 31:36.625
You want to get rid of me
so you can be with her.

31:36.708 --> 31:38.333
I'm worried about her, damn it.

31:41.125 --> 31:42.875
Hey! That's Dani.

31:42.958 --> 31:44.791
Start the car. Hurry the hell up.

31:44.875 --> 31:46.166
Son of a bitch.

31:47.208 --> 31:48.208
What are you doing?

31:48.291 --> 31:49.375
Get out of the way!

31:49.458 --> 31:50.625
Move, for fuck's sake!

31:52.916 --> 31:53.791
Taxi!

32:06.458 --> 32:07.291
Kami!

32:07.375 --> 32:08.833
- No, Dani, please.
- Kami, wait up.

32:08.916 --> 32:10.958
- I want to go home.
- You promised we'd talk.

32:11.041 --> 32:12.833
- Tomorrow. I don't want to now.
- Right.

32:12.916 --> 32:15.041
- You keep saying that. Let's talk now.
- Stop it.

32:15.125 --> 32:16.833
I don't want to talk! Let me go!

32:16.916 --> 32:18.583
- Wanna break up? Say it to my face.
- I...

32:18.666 --> 32:20.625
- Have some guts.
- We've broken up, Dani!

32:20.708 --> 32:21.666
Leave me alone!

32:21.750 --> 32:23.708
You want to fuck
those two brothers, don't you?

32:23.791 --> 32:24.708
You're hurting me.

32:24.791 --> 32:26.541
- Dani! Let her go.
- Get off me!

32:26.625 --> 32:28.250
Fuck you, asshole.

32:28.333 --> 32:30.958
Dude, you're wasted
and you're assaulting her.

32:31.041 --> 32:32.166
You'd better chill, okay?

32:34.375 --> 32:35.291
Blow me.

32:39.958 --> 32:41.375
Come on, I'll take you home.

32:41.833 --> 32:42.708
Thiago!

32:42.791 --> 32:45.083
- What the fuck are you doing?
- You want some too?

32:45.166 --> 32:46.166
Stop.

32:46.250 --> 32:48.041
- Stop, Thiago!
- Get out of here.

32:48.125 --> 32:49.083
Look at me.

32:49.166 --> 32:50.833
- Are you crazy?
- You want some too?

32:50.916 --> 32:52.000
Go fuck yourself, asshole!

32:52.083 --> 32:53.416
Taylor!

32:53.500 --> 32:55.708
- Taylor! That's enough.
- Are you out of your mind?

32:55.791 --> 32:57.333
Hey! It's all right, okay?

32:59.375 --> 33:01.250
Now, everyone get the fuck home.

33:02.500 --> 33:04.125
We'll talk about this at school.

33:05.791 --> 33:07.125
You're dead, Di Bianco!

33:09.791 --> 33:11.833
Which one of us
are you talking to, asshole?

33:14.833 --> 33:15.750
Hey!

33:19.583 --> 33:20.875
What are you doing? Hey!

33:20.958 --> 33:22.416
What are you doing? Hey!

33:24.583 --> 33:25.625
Get off me, loser!

33:25.708 --> 33:26.750
Don't touch me!

33:26.833 --> 33:28.125
Don't fucking touch me!

33:32.625 --> 33:33.666
What was that?

33:34.833 --> 33:35.958
He was assaulting you.

33:36.708 --> 33:38.333
The situation was under control.

33:38.416 --> 33:40.791
Right, sorry. The super brothers
already rescued you,

33:40.875 --> 33:42.500
so the rest of us are just in the way.

33:46.583 --> 33:49.208
Remind me not to help you
when your psycho boyfriend comes back.

33:49.291 --> 33:51.375
- Excuse me?
- How about "Thank you, Jules"?

33:51.458 --> 33:52.625
Is this guy high?

33:53.375 --> 33:54.416
Bye.

33:59.958 --> 34:00.916
Taxi!

34:04.250 --> 34:06.208
Come on, let's go home.

34:08.291 --> 34:09.125
Come on.

34:12.416 --> 34:13.666
Fuck.

34:15.625 --> 34:17.333
You're still into her, aren't you?

34:18.375 --> 34:19.666
Me?

34:19.750 --> 34:22.250
You're the one
who's always been obsessed with her.

34:22.791 --> 34:24.833
- And apparently you still are.
- No.

34:24.916 --> 34:26.958
- Sure.
- No, Tay. I hate her.

34:27.041 --> 34:28.750
- Come on...
- Can I ask you something?

34:28.833 --> 34:31.333
- I won't stop talking to her.
- Just treat her

34:31.416 --> 34:33.291
like any other classmate or neighbor.

34:33.375 --> 34:35.666
You do what you gotta do.
But give me a break.

34:38.750 --> 34:40.541
I don't want to see Mom suffering again.

34:40.625 --> 34:42.375
Mom told me to invite her over.

34:43.458 --> 34:44.291
What?

34:45.958 --> 34:47.708
- What are you doing?
- She said that?

34:47.791 --> 34:50.791
Yeah. And if she's not caught up
in some fucking emotional mess,

34:50.875 --> 34:51.958
I don't know why you are.

34:52.041 --> 34:53.625
- Don't you dare bring her home.
- Dude...

34:53.708 --> 34:55.541
No, don't you fucking "dude" me, okay?

34:55.625 --> 34:58.000
She has always treated you like her pet.

34:58.666 --> 35:01.333
And you're always following her around,
wagging your tail.

35:04.458 --> 35:07.166
- What I mean is...
- Yeah, it's a metaphor. I get it.

35:09.375 --> 35:10.833
Please, man, it's...

35:11.875 --> 35:13.958
It's all I'm asking, all right?

35:14.041 --> 35:15.916
At least for a few months,
let's ignore her.

35:17.000 --> 35:18.083
Give me a break, man.

35:28.583 --> 35:30.125
Di Bianco, I'll tell you what.

35:30.208 --> 35:32.291
I know you're a good kid, I really do.

35:32.375 --> 35:34.958
And I can tell
you want to do things right,

35:35.041 --> 35:37.000
and we all have the right to screw up

35:37.083 --> 35:39.208
and have people look the other way. Right?

35:42.125 --> 35:43.708
- Yeah, sure.
- Good.

35:43.791 --> 35:46.583
Dani is our captain,
and we can't play without him.

35:47.375 --> 35:48.333
So, how about this?

35:48.416 --> 35:51.541
I'll pretend you didn't break
two golden rules,

35:51.625 --> 35:54.750
and you and I will both pretend
that Dani, well, didn't...

35:54.833 --> 35:56.541
Didn't lose his composure.

35:57.750 --> 35:58.958
But he assaulted Kamila.

36:06.458 --> 36:10.333
Should I call your supervisor and tell him
you've broken two golden rules?

36:14.666 --> 36:16.916
- No.
- No. That's it, then.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.208
Just give them a slap on the wrist
and that's that.

36:19.291 --> 36:22.333
But to everyone involved
in the brawl, even Kamila.

36:22.416 --> 36:24.208
- What?
- What do you mean, "what"?

36:24.291 --> 36:26.333
- This was a brawl.
- No.

36:26.416 --> 36:27.791
It was assault and self-defense--

36:27.875 --> 36:30.458
All right. That's it, then.

36:32.833 --> 36:34.208
A slap on the wrist.

36:36.583 --> 36:37.625
A slap on the wrist.

36:39.875 --> 36:40.958
Thank you.

37:03.833 --> 37:05.041
Kami, please.

37:05.125 --> 37:06.708
Are you trying to talk to Kami?

37:06.958 --> 37:08.916
- Touch me again and I'll kill you.
- Stop!

37:12.875 --> 37:13.875
Daniel.

37:16.291 --> 37:17.250
Taylor.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.416
Kamila. You three are in detention.

37:53.458 --> 37:55.500
Act like grown-ups, please.

37:55.583 --> 37:58.125
This is a very serious
and necessary topic.

38:36.416 --> 38:37.250
Kamila?

38:46.750 --> 38:47.791
Hi, Chiara.

38:48.125 --> 38:49.041
Hello.

38:51.416 --> 38:53.250
Long time no see.

39:01.666 --> 39:02.791
Should we get to it?

39:02.875 --> 39:03.791
- Come on.
- All right.

39:06.208 --> 39:07.333
Any ideas?

39:07.416 --> 39:08.333
In fact, yeah.

39:08.916 --> 39:09.791
Tell me.

39:10.916 --> 39:12.458
The <i>Kama Sutra.</i>

39:13.958 --> 39:17.125
Tay, it's about sexology
during adolescence.

39:17.208 --> 39:18.208
So?

39:18.291 --> 39:19.416
Can't we read?

39:20.708 --> 39:23.458
Well, maybe the problem is that...

39:23.541 --> 39:26.750
you guys know nothing
besides the missionary and doggy style.

39:27.458 --> 39:29.041
Oh, excuse me, Kami-sutra.

39:29.875 --> 39:32.208
I actually do have
vast knowledge in this area.

39:33.583 --> 39:35.416
- Really?
- Yeah.

39:37.041 --> 39:39.666
In theory or in practice?

39:40.708 --> 39:42.000
Both.

39:43.416 --> 39:47.375
Okay, prove your knowledge.

39:48.666 --> 39:49.916
All right...

39:52.583 --> 39:55.000
I'm sure you've never had a proper orgasm.

39:57.041 --> 39:57.875
Excuse me?

39:57.958 --> 39:59.791
- I mean, girls...
- You're going to tell me...

39:59.875 --> 40:01.791
- It's harder for girls.
- No, it's not!

40:01.875 --> 40:03.500
- Come on.
- It's not.

40:04.125 --> 40:04.958
Okay, whatever.

40:06.750 --> 40:09.000
Maybe it's harder with a guy.

40:09.083 --> 40:10.041
With a guy?

40:12.791 --> 40:15.000
I can get to the ends of the earth
on my own.

40:18.916 --> 40:21.041
You've never had an orgasm
with Dani, have you?

40:22.625 --> 40:23.875
I didn't say that.

40:23.958 --> 40:26.166
You didn't say you have either.

40:26.250 --> 40:28.458
Has he ever made you cum, yes or no?

40:28.958 --> 40:30.125
Without you helping it.

40:31.333 --> 40:32.875
No comment.

40:32.958 --> 40:36.208
All right. If we're not open about things,
we'll never get the project done.

40:37.166 --> 40:39.166
But that could be the whole focus
of the project.

40:39.250 --> 40:40.833
- What do you mean?
- That girls

40:40.916 --> 40:43.875
masturbate even more than guys,
but you don't talk about it.

40:43.958 --> 40:47.000
Maybe that's because
this bullshit sexist society

40:47.083 --> 40:50.208
brands us as sluts
if we masturbate and talk about it.

40:51.750 --> 40:53.041
You're right about that.

40:58.000 --> 40:59.208
So...

41:00.583 --> 41:02.833
You can get to the ends of the earth
on your own.

41:05.791 --> 41:06.666
What about you?

41:06.750 --> 41:07.875
What about me?

41:10.375 --> 41:13.583
Do you jerk off all day, like a monkey?

41:13.666 --> 41:14.666
Yeah.

41:15.208 --> 41:16.708
And as soon as you leave,

41:16.791 --> 41:19.458
I'm going to beat off
as I picture you touching yourself.

41:23.833 --> 41:25.333
Maybe...

41:26.041 --> 41:30.875
rubbing one out fantasizing about a friend
isn't quite right, is it?

41:31.625 --> 41:34.541
Picturing my friend
pleasuring herself naked under the sheets?

41:35.416 --> 41:38.500
Not only is it perfectly fine,
it's also a great fucking idea.

41:44.041 --> 41:46.500
I might even picture myself with you.

41:46.583 --> 41:49.500
Doing it to you. Take my word for it.

42:01.208 --> 42:02.166
What's she doing here?

42:02.250 --> 42:03.791
I thought you worked until 7:00.

42:04.166 --> 42:05.583
What the hell is she doing here?

42:05.666 --> 42:08.666
- Mom invited her over for a snack.
- You didn't tell him I was coming?

42:08.750 --> 42:11.166
No. Why should I?

42:11.250 --> 42:13.083
- Guys, I'm leaving.
- Kami, but why?

42:13.166 --> 42:14.833
It's okay, Tay. Don't worry about it.

42:26.833 --> 42:28.500
Didn't you say you'd get home at 7:00?

42:29.416 --> 42:31.000
Who cares how long I take?

42:31.083 --> 42:32.833
It's not my fault
if you came back earlier.

42:32.958 --> 42:34.375
Yes, it is,

42:34.458 --> 42:37.583
because I specifically asked you
not to bring her here.

42:37.666 --> 42:41.000
- Now I need your permission?
- It's my home too.

42:41.083 --> 42:42.250
- It's mine too.
- Is it?

42:42.333 --> 42:46.166
Yes, so this better be
the last time you pull this bullshit.

43:53.208 --> 43:55.083
He just wired the alimony.

43:57.125 --> 43:59.583
"An" hug. With an N.

43:59.666 --> 44:02.166
After seven years,
he hasn't corrected the descriptive text

44:02.250 --> 44:04.000
in his scheduled wire transfer.

44:07.708 --> 44:09.125
Hello.

44:09.208 --> 44:10.041
Hey!

44:11.000 --> 44:12.375
What are you doing here?

44:43.000 --> 44:44.166
Who is that kid?

44:50.666 --> 44:53.458
- Fine.
- It's boring, isn't it?

44:55.041 --> 44:56.125
Who are you?

44:56.208 --> 44:58.583
Thiago, you're going to scare him.

44:58.666 --> 45:00.625
My name is Carlos. I live right there.

45:07.333 --> 45:08.833
Dude, he's just a kid.

45:10.541 --> 45:12.375
He wasn't even born yet, man. Relax.

45:15.666 --> 45:17.375
Come with me. I'm taking you home.

45:29.375 --> 45:31.041
He's our new neighbor.

45:33.333 --> 45:35.500
Get inside, Carlos. It's raining.

45:41.333 --> 45:42.375
What's so funny?

45:43.958 --> 45:45.500
Who did you fuck to make that kid?

45:47.125 --> 45:49.708
Trying to be mean
doesn't suit you, Thiago.

45:49.791 --> 45:50.750
That's not you.

45:50.833 --> 45:52.791
You don't know who I am.

45:53.625 --> 45:54.958
You don't know me anymore.

46:02.875 --> 46:05.000
"Kam, this is for life."

46:08.833 --> 46:10.625
It's been almost eight years.

46:11.416 --> 46:12.416
Yeah.

46:13.166 --> 46:14.166
I know how many years,

46:14.250 --> 46:17.458
months, weeks and days
have passed since then, thank you.

46:32.500 --> 46:33.375
Hey!

46:34.750 --> 46:36.333
Is something wrong?

46:37.375 --> 46:40.750
It's just that your brother
really pissed me off.

46:41.458 --> 46:42.541
Let's go.

46:56.750 --> 46:58.791
Did you hear that?

46:59.625 --> 47:01.125
Skin.

47:03.000 --> 47:04.375
Intimacy.

47:08.750 --> 47:10.625
I can see it's turning you on.

47:12.833 --> 47:14.458
What else turns you on?

47:20.375 --> 47:23.583
Kisses, laughter...

47:27.708 --> 47:29.291
Fondling.

47:32.625 --> 47:34.166
Bare skin touching.

47:44.625 --> 47:46.083
Whispering.

47:49.791 --> 47:51.166
Whispering?

47:54.500 --> 47:56.375
What would you like me to whisper to you?

48:00.708 --> 48:02.791
What would you like to whisper to me?

48:38.708 --> 48:39.625
Hello.

49:10.958 --> 49:12.125
What is it?

49:12.208 --> 49:15.041
Kamila and Taylor,
to the principal's office.

49:15.125 --> 49:16.541
What did they do now?

49:18.208 --> 49:19.041
Let's go.

49:23.625 --> 49:26.625
You're too hot-headed, Di Bianco.

49:26.708 --> 49:28.916
A general needs to have self-control.

49:29.000 --> 49:31.666
Otherwise, he'd lose
the respect of his troops.

49:31.750 --> 49:33.500
I've looked the other way with these two.

49:33.583 --> 49:35.291
I can't let them keep doing what they--

49:35.958 --> 49:38.250
They kissed a little in class, that's all.

49:38.333 --> 49:39.791
They didn't kill anyone.

49:39.875 --> 49:43.125
Give them a couple more days of detention
and be done with it.

49:43.208 --> 49:45.250
But don't upset the boys.

49:45.333 --> 49:48.416
I need them focused
for the fall tournament.

49:48.500 --> 49:50.291
Okay? Yeah?

49:53.250 --> 49:54.208
Yeah?

50:12.833 --> 50:13.666
Let's go.

50:14.416 --> 50:16.000
Hey...

50:16.083 --> 50:17.416
Let's go to the restroom.

50:19.416 --> 50:20.583
We shouldn't, Tay.

50:20.666 --> 50:23.250
Why? Did this scare you?

50:23.791 --> 50:25.250
We were way out of line.

50:25.333 --> 50:28.125
Come on. We like each other.

50:28.208 --> 50:29.125
We wanted to.

50:30.875 --> 50:31.958
We were just horny.

50:32.500 --> 50:33.541
"Just horny"?

50:34.708 --> 50:36.375
That's all it was for you?

50:37.166 --> 50:38.125
We're friends.

50:38.208 --> 50:40.208
We're much more than friends, aren't we?

50:41.041 --> 50:42.750
Look at the mess we've caused.

50:44.541 --> 50:47.000
You've always cared more
about what he thinks.

50:47.083 --> 50:48.416
No, what are you talking about?

50:48.916 --> 50:50.000
No, Tay.

50:51.208 --> 50:53.208
I just want the three of us to be cool.

50:55.125 --> 50:56.500
Don't look at me like that.

50:56.583 --> 50:57.541
Taylor!

51:05.208 --> 51:07.750
<i>Didn't you like the kiss,
or don't you like me?</i>

51:08.458 --> 51:10.000
Come on, answer me.

51:14.625 --> 51:16.708
- Look.
- I want to touch it.

51:23.500 --> 51:24.875
Hurry up! That way!

51:33.666 --> 51:35.000
Where's Taylor?

51:36.375 --> 51:38.250
- We've lost Taylor.
- Let's go back.

51:57.166 --> 51:58.708
That's my dad's car.

52:30.375 --> 52:34.916
Anna, I can't go a whole week
without fucking you. You hear me?

53:07.208 --> 53:08.125
One...

53:08.916 --> 53:12.583
This is detention, not a spa.

53:12.666 --> 53:13.875
Music off.

53:20.041 --> 53:21.333
Two...

53:23.708 --> 53:24.791
You're late.

53:26.458 --> 53:27.666
I'm just a minute late.

53:28.333 --> 53:30.916
One minute, ten...

53:31.000 --> 53:33.041
If you're late, you're late.

53:33.125 --> 53:34.791
I'll notify the principal.

53:39.666 --> 53:41.416
Aren't you going to scold your brother?

53:41.500 --> 53:42.416
For three minutes?

53:43.625 --> 53:45.000
Three minutes isn't late.

53:45.083 --> 53:47.208
Waiting for up to five minutes
is considered polite.

53:48.083 --> 53:50.750
Three minutes, ten...
If you're late, you're late.

53:51.875 --> 53:54.333
Everyone be quiet and start studying.

54:05.041 --> 54:06.333
Thiago, stop.

54:06.416 --> 54:07.666
Thiago!

54:08.625 --> 54:09.916
Thiago, stop.

54:30.666 --> 54:33.041
Thiago, turn it around.
I don't know where Taylor is.

54:33.125 --> 54:35.333
Thiago, turn it around.

54:37.708 --> 54:39.708
Let's go home, please.

55:02.750 --> 55:04.041
Kam...

55:04.625 --> 55:06.416
Swear you won't tell anyone.

55:08.166 --> 55:09.208
What?

55:09.291 --> 55:10.666
You won't tell anyone.

55:11.791 --> 55:13.166
Swear it.

55:16.625 --> 55:17.916
I swear.

55:45.541 --> 55:46.875
What class is this for?

55:50.916 --> 55:52.083
What about the others?

55:53.375 --> 55:55.708
- They're reading notes on their cells.
- Snitch.

56:09.375 --> 56:11.791
These are the drawings
you used to do as a child.

56:37.500 --> 56:39.541
What are you doing? Give it back.

56:39.625 --> 56:41.416
- That's what you get.
- Quiet!

56:42.375 --> 56:43.666
Thiago, please.

56:43.750 --> 56:46.291
I'll start studying,
but give it back to me.

56:48.500 --> 56:49.541
Yeah?

56:50.541 --> 56:51.791
Really?

56:52.458 --> 56:53.500
Really.

56:54.416 --> 56:56.000
Please, Thiago.

56:56.958 --> 56:58.083
Really, really?

57:00.291 --> 57:01.708
Do you swear it?

57:37.791 --> 57:38.875
Kami, wait.

57:39.666 --> 57:42.125
- Not now, Jules. My dad's waiting for me.
- Okay.

57:42.208 --> 57:45.416
I just wanted to ask
if you'd like to grab a pizza sometime,

57:45.500 --> 57:46.583
hang out and chill.

57:46.666 --> 57:49.958
Jules, you're cute and nice...

57:50.041 --> 57:51.041
But?

57:51.666 --> 57:54.833
But you just moved here and you're getting
yourself involved in my life.

57:54.916 --> 57:57.500
The fight, detention,
you follow me on social media...

57:57.583 --> 57:59.083
You know everything about me.

57:59.875 --> 58:01.166
So I'm bothering you.

58:02.708 --> 58:03.625
A little.

58:04.583 --> 58:05.791
A lot, actually.

58:05.875 --> 58:08.958
Jules, you're coming on too strong,
and I don't know you.

58:09.666 --> 58:11.458
You think I'm hitting on you?

58:11.541 --> 58:13.875
I don't know, but bring it down a notch.

58:14.000 --> 58:16.666
I just want to get to know you
and be your friend.

58:16.750 --> 58:18.041
Why me?

58:18.125 --> 58:19.666
I don't know, I like you.

58:21.291 --> 58:22.583
You don't know me.

58:22.666 --> 58:25.583
I know what I see on your social media
and what people say about you.

58:26.750 --> 58:29.625
You seem like a really cool girl.
You're giving me great vibes.

58:31.125 --> 58:32.000
Okay.

58:32.875 --> 58:34.875
I'm sorry. Forgive me for being so rude.

58:34.958 --> 58:36.291
No, I'm sorry.

58:37.333 --> 58:40.041
You're right,
I came in like a steamroller.

58:41.041 --> 58:42.125
I'm really sorry.

58:44.250 --> 58:45.458
See you tomorrow.

58:48.625 --> 58:50.666
Jules, wait.

58:53.291 --> 58:54.250
Let's go.

58:55.958 --> 58:57.666
- Is that also you?
- Yes.

58:57.750 --> 58:59.083
You look so weird there.

58:59.166 --> 59:00.583
I haven't changed at all.

59:00.666 --> 59:01.833
Come on...

59:03.375 --> 59:05.291
And why is your account private?

59:08.875 --> 59:09.875
Bullying.

59:10.791 --> 59:12.041
For being a weirdo.

59:12.583 --> 59:14.791
Really bad bullying.

59:15.750 --> 59:16.666
Are you serious?

59:17.250 --> 59:18.375
Yes.

59:18.458 --> 59:21.083
That's why I asked my dad to move here,
with Cata and him.

59:21.166 --> 59:24.000
I only told them that I was being bullied,
but not the reason why.

59:24.083 --> 59:26.500
They assume it's because I'm gay.
Which I'm not,

59:26.583 --> 59:28.458
but, I don't know,

59:28.541 --> 59:30.500
I can't be bothered
to convince them otherwise.

59:31.375 --> 59:32.375
Why not?

59:32.791 --> 59:33.958
Why would I?

59:34.625 --> 59:36.833
It makes my life easier
if they believe that.

59:36.916 --> 59:40.250
Cata and my dad make a quick connection
between being gay, bullying,

59:40.333 --> 59:41.875
and my inability to defend myself.

59:41.958 --> 59:43.958
Because a straight guy
would defend himself.

59:44.583 --> 59:46.458
This way, they let me live with them.

59:47.958 --> 59:48.916
So be it.

59:49.500 --> 59:52.250
I don't counter their assumptions
and I can stay here.

59:52.333 --> 59:53.708
And that's that.

59:58.000 --> 59:59.083
Shall we go?

01:00:00.333 --> 01:00:02.166
- Thanks, Kami.
- It's nothing.

01:00:02.250 --> 01:00:04.125
- Will I see you tomorrow?
- Yes.

01:00:04.250 --> 01:00:05.458
See you tomorrow.

01:00:06.541 --> 01:00:07.416
Bye.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.208
I don't even know
how to tell you this, but...

01:00:14.833 --> 01:00:16.583
You don't stand a chance with Juli.

01:00:17.583 --> 01:00:19.250
Don't worry about it, Cata.

01:00:20.250 --> 01:00:21.458
Call him Jules.

01:00:21.541 --> 01:00:23.666
He prefers being called Jules.

01:00:30.583 --> 01:00:31.750
Look, Kami,

01:00:31.833 --> 01:00:34.125
stay away from my brother, okay?

01:00:35.541 --> 01:00:37.083
What do you think I'll do to him?

01:00:39.041 --> 01:00:41.958
I don't like people
who are always looking for attention

01:00:42.041 --> 01:00:44.208
and playing with other people's feelings.

01:00:45.416 --> 01:00:47.583
I think my Juli has suffered enough.

01:00:48.541 --> 01:00:50.833
Is that really what you think of me, Cata?

01:00:53.291 --> 01:00:57.125
That's what I think
and what everyone else thinks.

01:00:57.250 --> 01:00:59.000
The ice princess,

01:00:59.083 --> 01:01:00.958
the queen who needs attention.

01:01:02.750 --> 01:01:04.500
Kami, you're just like your mom.

01:01:05.208 --> 01:01:07.833
- What did you say about my mom?
- Don't make me repeat myself.

01:01:08.541 --> 01:01:10.666
Just stay away from my Juli.

01:01:46.250 --> 01:01:47.875
The first batch.

01:01:56.708 --> 01:01:58.291
I want a picture!

01:01:59.958 --> 01:02:01.791
- Come on.
- Again.

01:02:04.625 --> 01:02:06.125
A little churrasco.

01:02:08.416 --> 01:02:09.250
Dad!

01:02:09.875 --> 01:02:11.208
Dad, take a picture of us.

01:02:12.291 --> 01:02:13.416
Roger!

01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:14.541
- Roger!
- What?

01:02:14.625 --> 01:02:15.958
Your daughter wants a picture.

01:02:16.041 --> 01:02:17.208
Leave it to me.

01:02:17.583 --> 01:02:19.666
Do you want a picture with everyone, Kami?

01:02:19.791 --> 01:02:22.041
Come, let's take a picture
with the magician.

01:02:22.125 --> 01:02:23.500
Everyone, stand together.

01:02:23.875 --> 01:02:25.791
And now I pull out this finger!

01:02:25.875 --> 01:02:27.708
My favorite birthday girl in the middle.

01:02:28.875 --> 01:02:30.791
There. Come on.

01:02:30.875 --> 01:02:32.458
- Nice! Thank you.
- Great, kids.

01:02:33.833 --> 01:02:34.791
Thanks, Dad.

01:02:36.041 --> 01:02:37.958
- You're having a great time, huh?
- Yes.

01:02:38.041 --> 01:02:40.041
A picture of you?
A picture of the four of you.

01:02:41.291 --> 01:02:42.500
Yeah?

01:02:43.375 --> 01:02:45.416
Let's take the picture. That's it.

01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:46.958
Lucía, you stand in front.

01:02:47.041 --> 01:02:48.708
- Great!
- That's it.

01:02:48.791 --> 01:02:51.041
- It's her birthday.
- Right there.

01:02:51.125 --> 01:02:53.500
- We're not in it, are we?
- No, you're fine.

01:02:53.583 --> 01:02:54.416
One more.

01:02:54.541 --> 01:02:56.291
- Let's see that smile.
- Very good.

01:02:57.125 --> 01:02:58.750
- Let us see it.
- Want to see it?

01:02:58.833 --> 01:03:02.000
- Of course. Let's see.
- Look. Here.

01:03:02.541 --> 01:03:04.458
- You look so handsome!
- I like that one.

01:03:04.541 --> 01:03:07.000
- That's the best one.
- Yeah, it's beautiful.

01:03:07.083 --> 01:03:08.875
Shall we have a race?

01:03:08.958 --> 01:03:11.833
- Sure.
- They're having a race around here.

01:03:11.916 --> 01:03:13.625
Come on, you too. What's up with you?

01:03:13.708 --> 01:03:15.333
- Go, come on!
- Winner gets a prize!

01:03:15.416 --> 01:03:16.541
You too, let's go!

01:03:19.250 --> 01:03:21.375
- What else do you need?
- We need bread.

01:03:21.458 --> 01:03:22.500
Some bread? Okay.

01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:28.541
You've got this... It seems broken.

01:03:28.625 --> 01:03:29.708
No, it's fine.

01:03:29.791 --> 01:03:30.875
Is it like that?

01:03:31.916 --> 01:03:35.666
- Come on, three, two, one, go!
- I'm going to beat you!

01:03:38.416 --> 01:03:39.291
Come on!

01:03:55.666 --> 01:03:58.000
Come on, Kami, you're falling behind.

01:03:58.083 --> 01:04:01.083
I saw her before. She's grown so much.
I'm going to check the grill.

01:04:03.125 --> 01:04:04.333
Kamila.

01:04:05.708 --> 01:04:07.291
- Kamila, are you okay?
- Honey.

01:04:07.375 --> 01:04:09.083
What happened?

01:04:09.166 --> 01:04:10.291
Dad!

01:04:10.375 --> 01:04:11.916
- Roger, please!
- Dad!

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.083
Come here.

01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:15.750
Let's see. Come on, honey.

01:04:15.833 --> 01:04:18.625
- Let's try to move her. Gently.
- Yes, carefully.

01:04:18.708 --> 01:04:19.875
- Come here.
- That's it.

01:04:19.958 --> 01:04:23.333
- Let's go inside to check if she's hurt...
- Don't worry, dear.

01:04:23.416 --> 01:04:24.916
...or if we need to clean her wound.

01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:26.750
Yeah, she fell.

01:04:39.208 --> 01:04:40.666
Kamila, wait.

01:04:41.875 --> 01:04:43.250
I can't. I have class...

01:04:43.333 --> 01:04:45.458
You can say you're late because of me.

01:04:48.958 --> 01:04:50.458
What do you want, Thiago?

01:04:51.791 --> 01:04:54.250
- I had no idea you--
- Stay away from my brother.

01:04:55.500 --> 01:04:56.458
What?

01:04:57.500 --> 01:04:59.291
Stay away from my brother.

01:05:00.041 --> 01:05:01.750
Stay away from my mother.

01:05:02.666 --> 01:05:04.416
From my house.

01:05:05.166 --> 01:05:06.708
And stay away from me.

01:05:21.833 --> 01:05:22.958
I won't.

01:05:27.208 --> 01:05:28.166
You won't?

01:05:49.416 --> 01:05:50.500
You will.

01:05:51.291 --> 01:05:52.833
Are you threatening me?

01:05:54.958 --> 01:05:56.416
What are you gonna do?

01:05:57.708 --> 01:05:59.708
Are you going to pull my hair to annoy me?

01:06:05.666 --> 01:06:06.666
No.

01:06:07.625 --> 01:06:11.041
But I can make your life
very difficult in this school.

01:06:12.250 --> 01:06:13.833
You have no power.

01:06:15.791 --> 01:06:18.041
And you can't talk to a student like that.

01:06:19.291 --> 01:06:22.458
And who are you to tell me
what I can or can't do?

01:06:31.541 --> 01:06:32.541
Thiago.

01:07:12.791 --> 01:07:13.625
Go.

01:07:14.583 --> 01:07:15.500
What?

01:07:18.833 --> 01:07:20.125
Get out of here.

01:07:58.541 --> 01:07:59.541
May I?

01:08:03.541 --> 01:08:04.458
Come on in.

01:08:14.333 --> 01:08:17.833
Thiago, ever since we got back to town,
we're at odds with each other.

01:08:21.250 --> 01:08:22.833
You know whose fault that is.

01:08:22.916 --> 01:08:24.625
It's our fault, dude.

01:08:25.750 --> 01:08:27.166
Our fault and no one else's.

01:08:27.666 --> 01:08:31.208
If you and I have a problem,
it's you and I who must work it out.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.125
That's it.

01:08:55.041 --> 01:08:56.541
We both care about Kami.

01:08:57.625 --> 01:08:58.958
You do too, Thiago.

01:09:01.333 --> 01:09:05.541
But you and I have always been together,
and we should stay together for life.

01:09:07.791 --> 01:09:09.500
You've always looked out for me.

01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:12.125
You've always been there for me.

01:09:12.916 --> 01:09:14.583
And I don't want you to feel bad.

01:09:16.250 --> 01:09:17.833
I don't want us to drift apart.

01:09:26.875 --> 01:09:27.833
I'm done with Kami.

01:09:31.875 --> 01:09:32.708
For real?

01:09:34.416 --> 01:09:37.041
Yeah, I'm done with her and so are you.

01:09:40.416 --> 01:09:42.916
Sure. Yeah.

01:09:49.833 --> 01:09:50.916
Come here.

01:09:51.833 --> 01:09:52.833
Come here.

01:10:00.666 --> 01:10:01.500
I love you.

01:10:02.208 --> 01:10:03.458
I love you too, man.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.708
Come on, guys. Keep it intense.

01:10:34.250 --> 01:10:36.083
Come on, you're six behind, brother.

01:10:36.166 --> 01:10:38.083
That's it. Let's switch.

01:10:39.416 --> 01:10:40.875
Three more, brother.

01:10:40.958 --> 01:10:42.041
Come on, guys.

01:10:42.166 --> 01:10:43.625
Let's go all the way.

01:10:46.125 --> 01:10:48.791
We've warmed up enough,
we've talked enough, let's go.

01:10:50.291 --> 01:10:53.208
- Come on, defend!
- We have to be ready for the tournament.

01:11:37.083 --> 01:11:38.458
- I'm going in.
- All right.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:45.916
What?

01:11:46.833 --> 01:11:47.666
Kami.

01:11:55.250 --> 01:11:56.166
Kami.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:00.875
Hi.

01:12:02.791 --> 01:12:04.250
Did you get my texts?

01:12:05.416 --> 01:12:06.333
Yes.

01:12:07.708 --> 01:12:09.958
You didn't reply, so...

01:12:11.666 --> 01:12:13.708
Something's been bothering me.

01:12:14.666 --> 01:12:16.583
Tell me about it. It's a long drive.

01:12:17.208 --> 01:12:19.583
I'd rather take a nap, to be honest.

01:12:24.541 --> 01:12:25.500
I'm sorry.

01:12:26.375 --> 01:12:28.208
I'm being rude because I'm tired.

01:12:29.125 --> 01:12:30.208
It's not your fault.

01:12:31.166 --> 01:12:33.166
I'll tell you about it
when we get there, okay?

01:12:33.250 --> 01:12:34.125
Okay.

01:12:36.458 --> 01:12:38.125
Do you want to watch a movie tonight?

01:12:40.708 --> 01:12:41.625
Okay.

01:13:18.750 --> 01:13:21.833
I can't wait to get the party started.
It's going to be epic.

01:13:23.958 --> 01:13:26.166
- Lions, Lions!
- Come on.

01:13:26.250 --> 01:13:28.708
<i>Di Bianco, keep your troops under control.</i>

01:13:28.791 --> 01:13:31.041
<i>We must win the tournament.</i>

01:13:54.583 --> 01:13:55.458
Kami.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:58.125
Kami, come on.

01:13:58.583 --> 01:14:00.791
- I don't want any.
- What do you mean?

01:14:01.333 --> 01:14:02.416
I don't feel like it.

01:14:03.125 --> 01:14:05.375
Come on, Kami, we're chilling.

01:14:05.458 --> 01:14:06.750
You're drunk.

01:14:06.833 --> 01:14:08.125
No.

01:14:08.208 --> 01:14:09.375
Come on.

01:14:09.916 --> 01:14:11.083
What about tomorrow?

01:14:11.833 --> 01:14:13.083
A game and a hangover?

01:14:14.958 --> 01:14:15.791
Come on.

01:14:17.041 --> 01:14:18.875
- Just a sip.
- Kami, come on.

01:14:20.166 --> 01:14:21.208
What is this?

01:14:21.291 --> 01:14:22.291
Gin and tonic.

01:14:25.958 --> 01:14:28.500
It's disgusting, Dani.
How can you drink that?

01:14:29.250 --> 01:14:31.041
Let's go!

01:14:36.625 --> 01:14:37.500
Here.

01:14:40.375 --> 01:14:41.916
Your captain's orders.

01:14:43.458 --> 01:14:44.791
Now you're cool with me?

01:14:44.875 --> 01:14:46.458
I don't get it, Cata.

01:14:47.083 --> 01:14:48.541
I'm doing some team building.

01:14:48.625 --> 01:14:50.500
You're building it really fucking well.

01:14:50.583 --> 01:14:52.291
You're so drunk.

01:14:52.375 --> 01:14:53.541
Come on.

01:14:53.625 --> 01:14:55.625
- No.
- Come on!

01:14:55.750 --> 01:14:57.291
No, please.

01:14:57.416 --> 01:14:59.416
- I'm tired.
- You're tired?

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:01.458
I don't feel like dancing.

01:15:01.583 --> 01:15:02.541
Kami!

01:15:02.625 --> 01:15:04.833
- Don't. Stop it.
- Kami!

01:15:04.916 --> 01:15:07.333
- Stop it, Cata. Stop.
- Kami!

01:15:07.416 --> 01:15:11.291
- Kami!
- Okay.

01:15:11.375 --> 01:15:13.291
None of us will be able to dance tomorrow.

01:15:18.125 --> 01:15:19.916
- You are...
- What?

01:15:20.750 --> 01:15:21.750
You are so...

01:15:23.375 --> 01:15:26.666
Hey, Juli told me
you guys are hanging out.

01:15:26.750 --> 01:15:28.666
You're not going, are you?

01:15:29.583 --> 01:15:31.083
No, you're not going.

01:15:31.166 --> 01:15:34.333
I can tell him
I asked you to stay here if you want.

01:15:34.416 --> 01:15:35.375
Okay?

01:15:45.958 --> 01:15:48.708
You guys are way ahead of me
and I'm not really in the mood.

01:15:49.916 --> 01:15:52.250
I'm going to the store
to get something to eat.

01:15:52.333 --> 01:15:53.833
Anyone want anything?

01:15:53.916 --> 01:15:56.125
Some ice, plastic cups, B12 vitamins?

01:15:56.208 --> 01:15:57.666
No? Okay, bye.

01:16:16.750 --> 01:16:20.375
SELF-SERVICE 24H
LOS LAGOS

01:16:42.083 --> 01:16:44.375
Is there something going on
at the campsite?

01:16:44.458 --> 01:16:46.125
Yes, a basketball tournament.

01:16:46.750 --> 01:16:49.333
Right, the fall tournament.

01:16:49.416 --> 01:16:50.458
That's right.

01:16:52.541 --> 01:16:53.500
Okay...

01:16:54.625 --> 01:16:55.625
Just a second.

01:17:22.625 --> 01:17:23.500
Hey.

01:17:29.125 --> 01:17:32.416
Who said you could leave camp
without my permission?

01:17:33.541 --> 01:17:35.791
Like you're keeping a close eye on us.

01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:38.541
Condoms?

01:17:42.125 --> 01:17:43.958
I need to kill some time, you know?

01:18:00.375 --> 01:18:01.250
What?

01:18:02.583 --> 01:18:03.500
Nothing.

01:18:04.625 --> 01:18:06.166
Aren't you aiming too high?

01:18:07.416 --> 01:18:08.708
A box of 12.

01:18:10.750 --> 01:18:12.750
They sell them individually too, Thiago.

01:18:13.625 --> 01:18:15.000
Got a problem?

01:18:15.833 --> 01:18:16.958
With you?

01:18:17.041 --> 01:18:19.041
Plenty. Should I give you a list?

01:18:23.875 --> 01:18:25.500
I can't let a student drink alcohol.

01:18:28.458 --> 01:18:29.375
Stop me.

01:18:32.666 --> 01:18:33.666
You know what?

01:18:33.750 --> 01:18:36.750
You're right,
I need to kill some time too.

01:18:43.041 --> 01:18:45.833
Who are you using your box of 12 with?

01:18:47.041 --> 01:18:48.708
That's none of your business.

01:18:48.791 --> 01:18:52.458
And you'd better not use yours
with the wrong person.

01:18:54.250 --> 01:18:55.458
Who do you mean?

01:18:56.291 --> 01:18:57.666
You know perfectly well.

01:18:58.416 --> 01:19:00.083
I don't know who you're talking about.

01:19:13.875 --> 01:19:15.708
Someone who doesn't need them extra large.

01:19:20.750 --> 01:19:21.916
Keep the change.

01:19:30.083 --> 01:19:31.041
All set?

01:19:35.916 --> 01:19:38.250
Unbelievable, the fall tournament...

01:20:03.666 --> 01:20:05.291
You're dressed light.

01:20:05.375 --> 01:20:06.958
It's warm in here.

01:20:08.125 --> 01:20:09.166
Come on in.

01:20:19.125 --> 01:20:21.333
- Should I turn it off?
- No, it's all right.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:35.291
I love this plan.

01:20:36.583 --> 01:20:37.625
Thank you.

01:20:39.666 --> 01:20:40.916
This is all I have.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.375
Unless you want some tap water.

01:20:43.625 --> 01:20:44.583
It's fine.

01:20:45.666 --> 01:20:46.666
Thanks.

01:21:08.291 --> 01:21:09.500
Jules...

01:21:09.583 --> 01:21:11.625
Now I do feel too warm.

01:21:11.708 --> 01:21:13.041
Sorry.

01:21:16.375 --> 01:21:18.583
- Are you always so...
- Expansive?

01:21:19.333 --> 01:21:20.291
Invasive.

01:21:22.166 --> 01:21:23.041
Damn.

01:21:24.166 --> 01:21:26.166
You should just bring it down a notch.

01:21:26.250 --> 01:21:27.833
Yeah, sorry.

01:21:28.250 --> 01:21:29.875
If you're uncomfortable, we can just--

01:21:29.958 --> 01:21:32.083
No. It's fine, Jules.

01:21:32.166 --> 01:21:34.500
Just control yourself, okay?

01:21:35.666 --> 01:21:36.833
That's all.

01:21:36.916 --> 01:21:38.375
- Relax, okay?
- All right.

01:21:39.208 --> 01:21:40.333
Come on, play it.

01:21:49.583 --> 01:21:50.625
Cheers.

01:22:00.333 --> 01:22:04.958
Welcome to the annual
three-way tournament!

01:22:05.041 --> 01:22:07.916
As the new school year begins,

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:13.583
the three best teams
from last season are back!

01:22:13.666 --> 01:22:16.708
We start with the Lions,

01:22:16.791 --> 01:22:22.625
the Carsville League champions!

01:22:23.375 --> 01:22:26.333
Next up, the Cup champions,

01:22:27.291 --> 01:22:31.541
- the Falls Church Tigers!
<i>- Lions, Lions!</i>

01:22:32.583 --> 01:22:38.125
And finally, the champions of the trophy,

01:22:38.208 --> 01:22:40.500
the high school of...

01:22:40.583 --> 01:22:42.875
Honey, you do the jump, all right?

01:22:42.958 --> 01:22:45.166
I can't. I didn't train to do Kami's jump.

01:22:46.791 --> 01:22:48.041
No, I didn't either.

01:22:50.416 --> 01:22:53.416
I'm gonna fucking kill her. Fucking brat.

01:23:52.958 --> 01:23:54.041
Fuck.

01:23:54.166 --> 01:23:57.416
Come on, guys.
We've worked hard to be here today,

01:23:57.500 --> 01:23:59.791
so we're winning this game, okay?

01:23:59.875 --> 01:24:01.875
Three, two, one, Lions!

01:24:01.958 --> 01:24:03.708
Let's go! Come on!

01:24:07.083 --> 01:24:08.458
I'm sorry.

01:24:08.541 --> 01:24:11.541
And you lectured us
about not dancing with a hangover.

01:24:13.125 --> 01:24:14.041
You suck.

01:24:14.125 --> 01:24:15.791
My alarm didn't go off.

01:24:18.541 --> 01:24:21.000
You're dead set on ignoring me.

01:24:21.083 --> 01:24:22.791
Ready for the tournament!

01:24:22.875 --> 01:24:23.708
Fine.

01:24:23.791 --> 01:24:25.083
Take your place. Now!

01:24:25.166 --> 01:24:26.791
Come on!

01:24:26.875 --> 01:24:28.458
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

01:24:28.541 --> 01:24:29.875
I'm sorry.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:41.916
<i>Kam!</i>

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:43.541
<i>Kam, wait up!</i>

01:26:44.625 --> 01:26:45.625
Kam.

01:26:46.958 --> 01:26:47.958
Kam, can you hear me?

01:27:01.791 --> 01:27:02.666
What's wrong?

01:27:04.208 --> 01:27:05.708
Where am I?

01:27:05.791 --> 01:27:07.458
You're at the camp's infirmary.

01:27:10.541 --> 01:27:11.541
Where's Thiago?

01:27:13.500 --> 01:27:14.541
At the game.

01:27:15.666 --> 01:27:16.958
He's the coach.

01:27:19.083 --> 01:27:20.125
What about you?

01:27:23.125 --> 01:27:24.333
I decided not to play.

01:27:24.958 --> 01:27:26.541
I didn't want to leave you.

01:27:26.625 --> 01:27:28.000
Are you serious?

01:27:28.708 --> 01:27:29.541
Yeah.

01:27:30.916 --> 01:27:33.125
You really did a number on yourself.

01:27:33.875 --> 01:27:37.291
But the doctor says you're fine
and there's nothing wrong with you.

01:27:38.666 --> 01:27:39.750
Kami...

01:27:41.875 --> 01:27:44.625
I don't know what I would've done
if something had happened to you.

01:27:48.416 --> 01:27:50.041
Sorry.

01:27:50.125 --> 01:27:51.125
It's okay.

01:27:53.416 --> 01:27:54.416
Is that better?

01:27:55.666 --> 01:27:57.458
I'm going to ask if you can go.

01:27:57.541 --> 01:27:58.375
Okay.

01:28:11.583 --> 01:28:13.583
Okay, I'll let you rest.

01:28:13.708 --> 01:28:14.791
Stay.

01:28:18.625 --> 01:28:19.708
Please.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.791
I also don't think we can be just friends.

01:29:02.416 --> 01:29:03.625
We can't, right?

01:29:04.750 --> 01:29:06.541
But we must try hard.

01:29:06.625 --> 01:29:07.625
Yeah.

01:29:13.500 --> 01:29:14.625
Taylor...

01:30:25.041 --> 01:30:25.875
Kami.

01:30:33.166 --> 01:30:34.250
Are you all right?

01:30:38.750 --> 01:30:39.750
No.

01:30:40.291 --> 01:30:41.750
I freaked out for a moment.

01:30:41.833 --> 01:30:42.666
Why?

01:30:44.166 --> 01:30:45.375
It's nothing.

01:30:46.416 --> 01:30:47.500
Shit.

01:30:51.583 --> 01:30:53.083
It's tomorrow, Tay.

01:30:53.916 --> 01:30:54.916
What's tomorrow?

01:30:58.250 --> 01:31:00.875
No, Kami, no. Don't go there.

01:31:04.125 --> 01:31:06.750
Don't let my brother's bullshit
mess with your head.

01:31:07.500 --> 01:31:08.833
It wasn't your fault.

01:31:12.583 --> 01:31:14.000
I think I want to be alone.

01:31:14.541 --> 01:31:15.541
In this state?

01:31:15.625 --> 01:31:17.541
There's no way
I'm leaving you alone like this.

01:31:17.625 --> 01:31:19.375
Tay, please. I need it.

01:31:43.541 --> 01:31:44.791
I was looking after her.

01:31:47.125 --> 01:31:49.916
What? We can't look after her now or what?

01:31:51.333 --> 01:31:53.791
- I didn't say anything.
- But I can hear you thinking.

01:32:04.833 --> 01:32:06.041
Are you all right, Kam?

01:32:24.875 --> 01:32:27.500
I was feeling anxious
and Tay was trying to calm me down.

01:32:29.166 --> 01:32:30.375
Why were you anxious?

01:32:35.291 --> 01:32:37.458
You think you're the only one
who remembers?

01:32:47.708 --> 01:32:50.583
Pack your things. We're going home.
The bus leaves in an hour.

01:32:50.666 --> 01:32:51.666
It was my fault.

01:32:56.375 --> 01:32:59.166
That's what you've wanted to hear
for seven years, isn't it?

01:33:00.041 --> 01:33:01.333
It was all my fault.

01:33:02.291 --> 01:33:03.375
Everything that happened,

01:33:03.458 --> 01:33:05.958
everything that came after,
whatever it was, it was my fault.

01:33:07.333 --> 01:33:08.916
Are you happy now, Thiago?

01:33:10.625 --> 01:33:12.916
Can we please get this over with?

01:33:14.250 --> 01:33:16.333
You don't need to torment me anymore.

01:33:16.416 --> 01:33:19.041
You need me to end up
at the bottom of the lake too.

01:33:32.083 --> 01:33:33.000
Careful.

01:33:33.791 --> 01:33:35.583
What's up? How are you doing here?

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
Need anything from the first-aid kit?

01:33:42.583 --> 01:33:44.125
It was nothing to worry about.

01:33:45.791 --> 01:33:46.875
Right?

01:33:46.958 --> 01:33:48.208
It really hurts.

01:33:50.625 --> 01:33:51.500
Here?

01:33:52.625 --> 01:33:54.041
Let me see. Move it.

01:33:55.208 --> 01:33:58.083
- More.
- Well done.

01:33:58.166 --> 01:33:59.583
That's great.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:02.791
Dad, do you love me?

01:34:04.625 --> 01:34:06.291
Of course I love you, sweetheart.

01:34:07.666 --> 01:34:08.541
And...

01:34:11.666 --> 01:34:13.750
will you always be with me?

01:34:20.375 --> 01:34:21.916
Is something worrying you?

01:34:26.458 --> 01:34:29.041
I'll put this away
and leave you two alone, okay?

01:34:29.958 --> 01:34:31.708
I saw something...

01:37:27.291 --> 01:37:28.583
Twelve o'clock.

01:37:31.333 --> 01:37:32.666
I love you, Mom.

01:37:35.250 --> 01:37:36.791
I love you too, dear.

01:37:41.541 --> 01:37:43.041
You know what?

01:37:45.041 --> 01:37:46.750
I was glad to see Kamila.

01:37:50.041 --> 01:37:52.458
And Tay is happy to have her around.

01:37:53.375 --> 01:37:56.125
The three of you
have always been very close.

01:37:59.416 --> 01:38:00.791
Thiago.

01:38:01.666 --> 01:38:02.666
Look at me.

01:38:06.666 --> 01:38:08.041
Let Kami go.

01:38:08.541 --> 01:38:10.958
It's not hatred you're feeling, honey.

01:38:11.625 --> 01:38:12.916
It's anger.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:14.500
And frustration.

01:38:15.208 --> 01:38:17.250
Towards everything and everyone.

01:38:18.625 --> 01:38:19.833
And that's natural.

01:38:21.583 --> 01:38:24.875
Because something so terrible
has to be someone's fault.

01:38:29.583 --> 01:38:31.041
Perhaps it is my fault.

01:38:33.625 --> 01:38:34.875
I believe it is.

01:38:35.791 --> 01:38:37.208
What are you talking about?

01:38:40.375 --> 01:38:42.333
I had more to do with it
than Kamila, didn't I?

01:38:42.416 --> 01:38:45.541
No. No, Mom. You were just a victim.

01:38:46.333 --> 01:38:48.083
Whose victim?

01:38:51.416 --> 01:38:53.458
The pain will never go away.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:56.958
But don't hurt yourself anymore.

01:38:58.500 --> 01:39:02.458
Let us take care of you now, okay?

01:39:03.958 --> 01:39:06.625
You've done enough over the years.

01:39:07.166 --> 01:39:11.000
You took care of your brother,
you took care of me.

01:39:11.083 --> 01:39:13.958
We're fine thanks to you, honey.

01:39:14.541 --> 01:39:17.375
Because you had no one
to take care of you, not even me.

01:39:17.458 --> 01:39:19.750
And I'm so sorry, honey.

01:39:20.333 --> 01:39:21.875
I'm so sorry.

01:39:22.333 --> 01:39:23.958
No, Mom, you don't need to be sorry.

01:39:24.041 --> 01:39:25.625
- Of course I do.
- No.

01:39:25.708 --> 01:39:28.291
Of course I do. And I apologize.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.541
From now on, I'll take care of you.

01:39:34.875 --> 01:39:38.125
I'll look after you, okay?

01:40:00.833 --> 01:40:01.833
<i>Where's your brother?</i>

01:40:01.916 --> 01:40:03.000
I don't know.

01:40:03.083 --> 01:40:04.041
Taylor!

01:40:04.791 --> 01:40:05.875
Hurry up!

01:40:05.958 --> 01:40:07.583
Hurry up, Taylor. Please, get in.

01:40:07.666 --> 01:40:09.500
Put your seat belt on.
Where's your brother?

01:40:09.583 --> 01:40:10.958
Where is he? Thiago!

01:40:11.041 --> 01:40:13.916
Get in the car! Hurry up, honey.
Get in the car, please.

01:40:14.416 --> 01:40:15.583
Get in the car, Thiago!

01:40:15.666 --> 01:40:17.583
Thiago, I'm sorry. Thiago.

01:40:19.458 --> 01:40:21.708
- Put your seat belt on.
- Chiara, please, can we talk?

01:40:21.791 --> 01:40:22.625
Chiara, please!

01:40:23.291 --> 01:40:24.750
Chiara!

01:40:24.833 --> 01:40:26.416
Open up!

01:40:31.333 --> 01:40:33.291
- Kamila, where are you going?
- Kami!

01:40:43.041 --> 01:40:46.250
I'm sorry. Please, forgive me.

01:41:14.500 --> 01:41:16.208
- What's going on?
- Everything's all right.

01:41:16.833 --> 01:41:18.375
Mom, what's happening?

01:41:25.833 --> 01:41:27.291
Hold Luci! Hold her!

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:29.291
Mom!

01:41:32.666 --> 01:41:34.333
Where are we going?

01:41:34.416 --> 01:41:35.541
Stay calm.

01:41:35.625 --> 01:41:36.625
Mom!

01:41:41.458 --> 01:41:43.333
Kids, it's all fine.

01:41:43.416 --> 01:41:44.333
Nothing's wrong.

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:52.708
Mom!

01:42:52.791 --> 01:42:53.833
Mom, the seat belt!

01:42:55.083 --> 01:42:56.166
Help!

01:43:00.916 --> 01:43:03.125
Remove your seat belt, Taylor!
Remove your seat belt!

01:43:03.208 --> 01:43:04.333
Lucía, wait!

01:43:04.416 --> 01:43:06.041
- Mom!
- Help!

01:43:09.083 --> 01:43:11.125
Mom, help me!

01:43:12.041 --> 01:43:13.625
Tay! Wait!

01:43:13.708 --> 01:43:16.333
Remove your seat belt, honey!

01:43:17.333 --> 01:43:18.541
Mom!

01:43:18.625 --> 01:43:20.333
- Help me!
- Mom.

01:43:20.416 --> 01:43:22.333
Mom!

01:43:22.416 --> 01:43:24.666
Don't open the door!

01:43:24.750 --> 01:43:27.333
Mommy! Help me!

01:43:27.416 --> 01:43:29.291
- Mommy!
- Don't pull, please.

01:43:30.166 --> 01:43:31.875
- Please!
- Mom!

01:43:31.958 --> 01:43:32.833
No!

01:45:45.791 --> 01:45:46.750
Thiago...

01:45:56.583 --> 01:45:59.000
Thiago, it was my fault,
but only to some extent.

01:46:01.500 --> 01:46:04.208
You don't blame your father, or my mother,

01:46:04.791 --> 01:46:06.875
or the fucking deer that got in your way.

01:46:06.958 --> 01:46:08.833
Thiago, you just blame me for everything.

01:46:11.375 --> 01:46:12.583
You know why?

01:46:20.583 --> 01:46:23.291
Because you're the biggest disappointment
in my entire life.

01:46:29.166 --> 01:46:30.083
Why?

01:46:37.875 --> 01:46:39.791
Because I loved you more than anyone else.

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:04.916
Thiago...

01:47:06.250 --> 01:47:07.708
I loved you too.

01:47:10.625 --> 01:47:11.500
Did you?

01:47:15.833 --> 01:47:19.708
And were you ever in love with me
as much as I was with you?

01:47:22.500 --> 01:47:23.375
Yes.

01:47:25.333 --> 01:47:26.375
"Yes," what?

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.208
"Yes, Thiago, I was in love with you?"

01:47:32.208 --> 01:47:36.000
"Yes, Thiago, I loved you
with all my heart like you loved me?"

01:47:38.541 --> 01:47:39.708
Tell me, Kam.

01:47:40.875 --> 01:47:42.083
We're alone.

01:47:43.291 --> 01:47:44.500
It's just you and me.

01:47:47.416 --> 01:47:48.541
So, tell me.

01:47:51.958 --> 01:47:53.291
Tell me softly.

01:47:59.416 --> 01:48:01.250
Yes, Thiago, it's always been you.

01:48:06.166 --> 01:48:09.875
It was you, it is you,
and it'll always be you.

01:49:13.166 --> 01:49:14.083
Are you all right?

01:49:21.541 --> 01:49:22.458
What's wrong?

01:49:39.250 --> 01:49:40.250
Do you love him?

01:49:48.166 --> 01:49:49.708
Are you in love with Tay?

01:50:09.083 --> 01:50:11.166
What about "It's always been you"?

01:50:12.791 --> 01:50:13.916
What about that, Kam?

01:50:14.791 --> 01:50:16.125
Why am I to blame?

01:50:18.250 --> 01:50:20.166
For being lost,
for not knowing what I want,

01:50:20.250 --> 01:50:21.708
for being a fucking mess?

01:50:22.916 --> 01:50:24.750
I have every right to feel this way.

01:50:27.041 --> 01:50:27.916
I'm out of here.

01:50:29.166 --> 01:50:31.166
Okay, great. Leave.
